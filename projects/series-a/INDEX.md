# Series A

Building the data and analytics angle for Indemn's Series A fundraising. Consolidating existing materials, identifying gaps, and producing investor-ready artifacts that demonstrate traction, market position, and product-market fit through data.

## Status
First session (2026-02-16). Inventoried all accessible Google Drive files and docs. Identified 9 existing Series A documents in Drive plus an extensive operations document set (numbered 1-13) covering frameworks, messaging, customer stories, and competitive positioning. Designed and built the project tracking system that this INDEX lives in. Next: review the existing Series A materials to understand what's already written and identify gaps for the data/analytics angle.

## Decisions
- 2026-02-16: Building a data/analytics angle for the Series A — not just narrative docs but data-backed evidence of traction and PMF

## Open Questions
- What specific data points does Cam want to highlight to investors?
- What's the timeline for the raise?
- Which existing docs are current vs. stale?
- What data from meetings DB, Stripe, and platform usage would be most compelling?
