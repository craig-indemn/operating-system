Core Identity & Ambition
Indemn is the "digital workforce" for Insurance Distribution. We empower Carriers, MGAs, and Brokers to scale capacity, extend reach, and capture revenue by deploying specialized AI that works alongside human teams.
Purpose: To "Make Insurance a Conversation." We believe the complex process of buying and servicing insurance should be as simple, guided, and intelligent as a natural conversation.
Mission: To be the "Insurance-Native" intelligence layer that powers Insurance Distribution. We understand the regulatory, operational, and technical realities of the industry, ensuring our AI drives tangible business outcomes.
Core Value Proposition: While we deliver efficiency and control, our key differentiator is Revenue Growth. We deploy "AI Associates" that work alongside your teams to unblock bottlenecks, allowing you to quote more business, bind faster, and retain more clients.
Products & Technology: The Associate Suite
Our platform delivers four specific business outcomes: Revenue Growth, Operational Efficiency, Client Retention, and Strategic Control.
While the specific application varies depending on whether you are a Carrier, MGA, or Agency, our suite provides a flexible digital workforce that adapts to the unique needs of each distribution partner.
The Revenue Engine
The Outcome: Unlocks capacity to capture missed revenue.
Example Capabilities:
24/7 Quoting & Binding: Executes full quote-to-bind workflows for brokers or consumers, capturing business outside of standard office hours.
Eligibility Triage: Instantly qualifies submissions against program appetite. It filters "out-of-appetite" risks so human underwriters focus only on bindable, high-value business.
Agent Portal Support: Guides independent agents through complex product guidelines directly within the portal, preventing "Not Taken Up" (NTU) submissions.
The Efficiency Engine
The Outcome: Liberates human staff from administrative drudgery and high-volume noise.
Example Capabilities:
Service Automation: Acts as a "digital receptionist" for agencies, instantly resolving high-volume tasks like Certificates of Insurance (COIs), billing inquiries, and document requests without human intervention.
Underwriting Guardrails: Enforces deterministic rules on every submission to ensure strict binding compliance and reduce error ratios.
Internal Knowledge Search: Acts as a "super-search" for internal staff, instantly retrieving answers from thousands of pages of policy forms and claims manuals.
The Retention Engine
The Outcome: Protects the book of business and maximizes Lifetime Value (LTV).
Example Capabilities:
The "Silent Churn" Defender: Automatically reviews upcoming renewals to flag price spikes (e.g., >10%) and drafts proactive "remarket" or review emails for the agent.
Cross-Sell Identification: Scans existing policies during the renewal window to identify coverage gaps (e.g., bundling Auto with Home) and suggests specific cross-sell offers.
Lapse Prevention: Proactively contacts policyholders via text/email when payments are overdue to prevent cancellation.
The Control Engine
The Outcome: Provides operations leaders with visibility, agility, and governance.
Example Capabilities:
No-Code Agility: Empowers program managers to update eligibility rules or launch new niche products in days, not months, without engineering support.
Distribution Analytics: Tracks exactly which brokers are quoting, converting, or dropping off in real-time, providing actionable distribution insights.
The Differentiator: Human-in-the-Loop
The Safety Net: We treat AI as a collaborative tool, not a "black box." Our Human-in-the-Loop architecture is the foundational quality control layer. When AI encounters high-risk or ambiguous situations, it queues a recommended response for human review, ensuring you can scale aggressively without compromising compliance or trust.
