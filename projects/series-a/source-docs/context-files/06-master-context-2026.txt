1. Core Identity & Ambition
Indemn is the "digital workforce" for Insurance Distribution. We empower Carriers, MGAs, and Brokers to scale capacity, extend reach, and capture revenue by deploying specialized AI that works alongside human teams.
Purpose: To "Make Insurance a Conversation." We believe the complex process of buying and servicing insurance should be as simple, guided, and intelligent as a natural conversation.
Mission: To be the "Insurance-Native" intelligence layer that powers Insurance Distribution. We understand the regulatory, operational, and technical realities of the industry.
Key Differentiator: While we deliver efficiency and control, our primary value is Revenue Growth. We deploy "AI Associates" that work alongside teams to unblock bottlenecks, allowing them to quote more business and bind faster.
2. The Lexicon Shift: How We Speak
To change how the market perceives us, we must use specific language.
Stop Saying
	Start Saying
	Why?

"Chatbot" / "Bot"
	"Associate" / "Engine"
	Bots are cheap/dumb. Engines drive business results.

"Cost Savings"
	"Revenue Capacity"
	Savings are finite; Capacity is infinite. Leaders buy growth.

"Deflection Rate"
	"Resolution Rate"
	"Resolution" implies helping the customer, not avoiding them.

"Vendor"
	"Partner"
	Partners are integral to the strategy.

"Tool"
	"Capability"
	Tools sit in a box. Capabilities change business outcomes.
3. Product Architecture: The Associate Suite
Our platform delivers four specific business outcomes. We do not sell "features"; we sell these engines:
The Revenue Engine (Priority Differentiator)
The Outcome: Unlocks capacity to capture missed revenue.
Example Capabilities:
24/7 Quoting & Binding: Executes full quote-to-bind workflows, capturing business outside of office hours.
Eligibility Triage: Instantly filters submissions against program appetite. It declines "junk" risks so underwriters focus only on bindable, high-value business.
Agent Portal Support: Guides agents through complex guidelines to prevent "Not Taken Up" (NTU) submissions.
The Efficiency Engine
The Outcome: Liberates human staff from administrative drudgery.
Example Capabilities:
Service Automation: Acts as a "digital receptionist" for agencies, resolving high-volume tasks (COIs, Billing) instantly.
Underwriting Guardrails: Enforces deterministic rules on submissions to ensure strict binding compliance.
Internal Knowledge Search: Acts as a "super-search" for internal staff to retrieve answers from policy manuals instantly.
The Retention Engine
The Outcome: Protects the book of business and maximizes Lifetime Value (LTV).
Example Capabilities:
The "Silent Churn" Defender: Automatically reviews renewals, flags price spikes (>10%), and drafts proactive retention emails.
Cross-Sell Identification: Scans policies for coverage gaps (e.g., missing Cyber) and suggests specific cross-sells.
The Control Engine
The Outcome: Provides visibility, agility, and governance.
Example Capabilities:
No-Code Agility: Allows managers to update eligibility rules in days, not months.
Distribution Analytics: Tracks broker quoting behavior and conversion drop-offs in real-time.
The Differentiator: Human-in-the-Loop
We treat AI as a collaborative tool, not a "black box." Our Human-in-the-Loop architecture is the foundational Safety Net. When AI encounters high-risk or ambiguous situations, it queues a recommended response for human review. This ensures safety and compliance.
4. Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) & Strategy
Priority 1: Mid-Market MGAs (The Revenue Play)
The Problem: Drowning in submissions; wasting 70% of time on "out-of-appetite" risks.
The Pitch: Deploy The Revenue Engine for "Eligibility Triage." We clean the inbox so you can double your premium volume without hiring new underwriters.
Priority 2: Mid-Market Agencies (The Scale Play)
The Problem: Staff burnout from high-volume admin tasks (COIs, Billing).
The Pitch: Deploy The Efficiency Engine as a "Digital Receptionist."
The Constraint: Standardization. We offer a "Personalized Standard Solution." We do not build custom bots for agencies <$50M revenue.
Priority 3: Carriers (The Strategic Play)
The Problem: Institutional knowledge traps and high "Not Taken Up" rates.
The Pitch: Start with Internal Knowledge Search (Efficiency) to build trust, then expand to Agent Portal Support (Revenue).
5. Go-to-Market: The "Bridge" Strategy
We acknowledge the market often asks for "Point Solutions" (e.g., a chatbot). We use these requests as a Wedge to land the account, then fulfill them with our Engine architecture.
Client Asks For...
	We Solve With...
	The "Upsell" Logic

"A Chatbot for FAQs"
	Efficiency Engine
	"Start with FAQs, then turn on the Receptionist for COIs."

"Automated Quoting"
	Revenue Engine
	"Add 'Eligibility Triage' so you stop quoting bad risks."

"Internal Search"
	Efficiency Engine
	"It searches manuals today; tomorrow let it enforce those rules."
6. Competitive Positioning: Outcome vs. Tool
We do not compete on "Features" (e.g., LLM benchmarks). We compete on Domain Specificity and Outcomes.
vs. Horizontal Platforms (Teneo, Cognigy): They sell a "Tool" you have to build. We sell a "Digital Workforce" that understands insurance (FNOL, Binding) on Day 1.
vs. Point Solutions (Quandri, Roots): They sell "Task Automation" (RPA). We sell "Reasoning" (AI) that can explain coverage and identify cross-sells.
vs. Deep Math (Akur8, Federato): They build the "Brain/Pricing." We are the "Sales Engine" that connects their math to the broker.
7. Content Guidelines & Heuristics
Behavioral Heuristics to Apply
Anchoring: Anchor on the Lost Revenue of the status quo, not the price of the software.
Cognitive Ease: Emphasize simplicity. "Quick time to production (~60 days)" and "No-Code Studio".
Scarcity: Frame pilot programs for the Revenue Engine as "Partnerships to co-develop frontier capabilities".
Social Proof: Use "Insurance-Native" language to prove we belong. Cite specific peer outcomes (e.g., "MGAs see 2x capacity").
Technical Validators (Evidence)
Rapid Time-to-Value: ~60 days to production.
Insurance-Native: Pre-trained on binding authority and surplus lines logic.
API-First: Integrates with AMS/PAS ecosystems (Guidewire, Vertafore).
No-Code Control: Operations teams can update rules without IT support.
