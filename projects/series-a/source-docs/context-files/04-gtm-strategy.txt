1. Executive Summary: The "Bridge" Strategy
Our GTM motion is evolving from selling "AI Tools" (Chatbots/Point Solutions) to selling Business Outcomes (Revenue, Efficiency, Retention).
The Challenge: The market still asks for point solutions (e.g., "Do you have a CSR bot?").
The Strategy: We will use these point solution requests as the "Wedge" to land the account, but we will fulfill them using the Business Outcomes architecture.
Old Pitch: "Yes, we have a CSR bot."
New Pitch: "Yes, we deploy The Efficiency Engine configured specifically for your service workflow. This same engine can later be trained to handle underwriting queries without additional software."
Primary Objective: Land 10 Mid-Market MGAs with The Revenue Engine by Q3 2026, while migrating existing Agency prospects to the standardized Efficiency model.
2. The Transition: From "Point Solutions" to "Business Outcomes"
To maintain sales velocity while pivoting, we will map current market demands to our new Engines.
Customer Asks For...
	We solve with...
	The "Upsell" Logic (The Bridge)

"A Chatbot for FAQs"
	The Efficiency Engine (Service Automation)
	"Start with FAQs. Once it knows your products, turn on the 'Receptionist' capabilities to handle COIs and Billing automatically."

"Automated Quoting"
	The Revenue Engine (Transaction Execution)
	"Quoting is step one. We also include 'Eligibility Triage' so your underwriters stop seeing garbage submissions."

"A Renewal Reminder"
	The Retention Engine (Churn Defense)
	"Don't just remind them. Use the Engine to scan for cross-sell gaps (e.g., Cyber) and pitch the upsell in the same email."

"Internal Search Tool"
	The Efficiency Engine (Knowledge Management)
	"It searches your manuals today. Tomorrow, let it enforce those guidelines on every new submission as an Underwriting Guardrail."
3. Target Segments & Prioritization
(Aligned with updated ICPs)
Priority 1: The "Revenue" Play (Mid-Market MGAs)
The Hook: "Unblock Distribution."
The Wedge: The Revenue Engine (Eligibility Triage). Every MGA is drowning in submissions. Selling a capability that "cleans the inbox" is the fastest way to get a contract signed.
The Expansion: Once we control the "Front Door" (Triage), we expand to full Quoting (Revenue) and Compliance (Efficiency).
Priority 2: The "Scale" Play (Retail Agencies)
The Hook: "Stop the Admin Noise."
The Wedge: The Efficiency Engine. Position it as a "Digital Receptionist" for COIs and Billing.
The Constraint: Standardization. We must brutally enforce a "Standard Product" model here. No custom workflows for agencies under $50M. We sell a configurable off-the-shelf solution to keep CAC low.
Priority 3: The "Strategic" Play (Carriers)
The Hook: "Operational Efficiency."
The Wedge: The Efficiency Engine (Internal Knowledge Search). It is low-risk, high-value, and bypasses the scary "Customer-Facing AI" compliance hurdles initially.
The Expansion: Once the Engine proves it knows the guidelines (internally), we promote it to Agent Portal Support (External Revenue).
4. Sales Motion: Land & Expand 2.0
Phase 1: The "Wedge" (Land)
We do not pitch the entire platform on Day 1. It is too big. We pitch the Single Engine that solves their bleeding neck problem.
Action: Identify the specific pain (e.g., "My underwriters are burnout").
Solution: Pitch The Revenue Engine solely as a "Submission Triage" capability.
Metric: "We will reduce 'out-of-appetite' reviews significantly in 60 days."
Phase 2: The "Unlock" (Value Realization)
Once the Engine is live, we use the Human-in-the-Loop dashboard to prove value.
Tactic: Show the client the "Saved Hours" dashboard from The Control Engine.
Transition: "Now that the system understands your appetite, why not let it draft the decline letters for you?" (Turning on generative capabilities).
Phase 3: The "Expansion" (Cross-Sell)
Leverage the "Single Brain" advantage.
Pitch: "You already have the knowledge base trained on your products. For an add-on fee, we can activate The Retention Engine. It uses that exact same knowledge base to scan your book for churn risks."
Outcome: Increasing ACV (Annual Contract Value) without a new implementation project.
5. Pricing & Revenue Model Shift
To align with "Outcomes," our pricing must evolve from "Seat Licenses" to "Capacity."
Mid-Market (Agencies): Tiered Subscription. Standard SaaS model based on feature sets (e.g. Receptionist vs. Full Integration).
MGAs & Carriers: Base Platform + Transaction Volume.
Base Fee: Covers The Control Engine (Strategy Studio) and knowledge maintenance.
Volume Metric: Pricing scales based on the outcome delivered, such as "Submissions Processed" (Revenue) or "Policies Monitored" (Retention).
Why: This aligns our revenue with their growth. If we help them quote more (Revenue), we get paid more.
6. Marketing & Messaging
Theme: "Capacity, Not Chatbots."
Stop Saying: "We have an AI chatbot."
Start Saying: "We provide a Digital Workforce that scales your underwriting capacity."
Content Campaign: "The Human-in-the-Loop Advantage."
Create case studies specifically showing how the Safety Net caught a bad AI decision, proving that our system is safe for regulated business. This builds the trust needed to close Carriers.
