Strategic Prioritization Overview
To maximize velocity and differentiation, our sales efforts are prioritized based on the potential to deploy The Revenue Engine.
Priority 1 (The "Sweet Spot"): Mid-Market MGAs & Program Administrators. They have the underwriting authority ("the pen") to drive revenue and the agility to buy quickly.
Priority 2 (The "Scale Play"): Mid-Market Agencies & Brokerages. High volume opportunities that must be aggregated and served via standardized, personalized solutions.
Priority 3 (The "Strategic Long-Game"): Carriers. High value but long sales cycles. We engage here for "Efficiency" and "Control" while nurturing long-term revenue partnerships.

ICP 1: Mid-Market MGAs & Program Administrators (Primary Focus)
Who They Are: Specialty intermediaries with delegated underwriting authority. They typically manage niche programs (e.g., Trucking, Habitational, Cyber) and rely on a network of independent retail brokers for distribution .
Buying Persona: Chief Underwriting Officer (CUO) or Head of Programs. They care about "Loss Ratios" and "Submission Volume."
The Problem: They are drowning in submissions. Human underwriters waste 60-70% of their time reviewing "out-of-appetite" business, missing the best opportunities in the pile.
The Solution: The Revenue Engine & The Control Engine
Primary Pitch (Revenue): Deploy The Growth Associate to perform "Eligibility Triage." The AI instantly qualifies submissions against program guidelines. It declines the junk and prioritizes the "bindable" business for human underwriters .
Differentiation: We don't just "save time"; we unlock capacity. We allow them to double their submission intake without hiring a single new underwriter.
Secondary Pitch (Control): The Strategy Studio allows them to update eligibility rules in real-time (e.g., "Stop writing frame construction in Florida") without IT tickets .

ICP 2: Mid-Market Retail Agencies & Brokerages
Who They Are: Scaling independent agencies (typically $5M - $50M revenue) dealing with high-volume client service needs. They are squeezed by direct carriers on speed and by labor shortages on cost .
Buying Persona: Agency Principal or VP of Operations. They care about "EBITDA" and "Staff Retention."
The Problem: Their highly paid producers and account managers are stuck doing minimum-wage work (issuing Certificates of Insurance, answering billing questions), leading to burnout and missed sales goals .
The Solution: The Efficiency Engine & The Retention Engine
Sales Strategy: Aggregation. We do not build "custom" bots for individual agencies. We offer a Personalized Standard Solution. The underlying workflow (e.g., "Process a COI") is standard across all clients, but the AI is "personalized" with the agency's specific branding, carrier appointments, and tone .
Primary Pitch (Efficiency): The Service Associate acts as a "Digital Receptionist." It handles the high-volume noise (COIs, billing, docs) instantly, freeing staff to sell .
Secondary Pitch (Retention): The Renewal Associate automates the "Silent Churn" defense, proactively reviewing renewals and flagging risks before the client leaves .

ICP 3: Insurance Carriers
Who They Are: The risk bearers. They are large, complex, and slow-moving, but offer massive scale potential .
Buying Persona: Chief Claims Officer, VP of Digital Transformation, or Innovation Leads.
The Problem: Institutional knowledge is trapped in PDFs and veteran brains. Junior staff makes costly errors because they can't find the right guidelines. They also suffer from high "Not Taken Up" (NTU) rates because their agent portals are confusing .
The Solution: The Efficiency Engine (Internal) & The Revenue Engine (External)
Primary Pitch (Internal Efficiency): The Policy Associate (Knowledge Search). We position this as an "Internal Super-Search" that allows junior staff to instantly retrieve answers from thousands of pages of policy forms and claims manuals .
Primary Pitch (External Revenue): The Growth Associate (Portal Support). Embed the Associate in the agent portal to guide brokers through complex appetites, reducing NTU rates and making the carrier "easiest to do business with" .
Critical Enabler: Human-in-the-Loop. We win here by emphasizing safety. We are not a "black box"; we are a controlled, auditable tool that drafts recommendations for human approval .

ICP 4: Strategic Partners (Insurtech & Systems)
Who They Are: Agency Management Systems (AMS), Policy Admin Systems (PAS), and specialized Insurtechs (e.g., Fraud detection) .
The Opportunity: Embed Indemn as the "Engagement Layer" on top of their systems.
The Pitch: We make your system "conversational." Instead of a user clicking 50 buttons in your AMS to find a policy, they just ask the Indemn Associate. This increases their user stickiness and gives us massive distribution leverage .
