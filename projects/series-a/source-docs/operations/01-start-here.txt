Claude Code Quick Wins for Cam

What is this?

Claude Code is an AI assistant that runs in your terminal with direct access to Google Docs, Slack, and all our Indemn context. Instead of copy-pasting between apps, you just tell Claude what you want.


Try These Right Now

Once you're set up, open Claude Code and try:

1. "List my recent Google Docs"
   → See everything you've been working on

2. "Read the Series A Revenue Defense doc"
   → Pulls it into the conversation so you can discuss it

3. "What's happening in #general on Slack?"
   → Summarizes recent team discussion

4. "Create a new Google Doc called 'Investor FAQ Draft'"
   → Creates it instantly, ready to edit

5. "Help me write the opening paragraph of our pitch, focusing on Revenue Growth"
   → Uses Four Outcomes context to draft content


What Claude Knows About Indemn

Claude has access to:
- The Four Outcomes framework (you created this)
- Our messaging rules (Associate not Chatbot, etc.)
- Series A materials and weighted pipeline
- Customer proof points from 400+ meetings

So when you ask Claude to write something, it writes it the Indemn way.

Based on your role, Claude is tuned to help with:
- Series A narrative drafting
- GTM messaging alignment
- Investor materials
- Customer proof points and quotes
