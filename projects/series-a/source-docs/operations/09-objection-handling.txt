Objection Handling & Competitive Positioning

How to respond to every objection and how we win against every competitor category.


STRATEGIC MARKET POSITION

The market for AI in insurance has bifurcated:
- The "Tool" Vendors: Horizontal platforms selling "AI Orchestration" kits
- The "Point" Specialists: Niche engines solving specific workflow problems

Indemn's Position: We fill the vacuum in the middle as an Insurance-Native Engagement Layer.

We do not sell "Chatbots" or "RPA bots." We sell Business Outcomes (Revenue, Efficiency, Retention).


COMPETITIVE CATEGORIES & HOW WE WIN

Category A: The "Tool Builders" (Horizontal AI Platforms)
Players: Teneo.ai, Cognigy, Aisera, Botpress

Their Pitch: "Enterprise-grade orchestration for any industry."

Why Indemn Wins: We are Insurance-Native. We understand "binding authority" and "surplus lines." We execute workflows (Bind, Issue), not just chat.

Takedown Script: "Those platforms are general-purpose toolkits. You'd need to spend months teaching them what 'NTU' means. We're pre-trained on insurance logic - we're productive on Day 1."


Category B: The "Deep Math" & Pricing Specialists
Players: Akur8, hyperexponential (hx)

Their Pitch: "We use AI to build the perfect pricing model."

Why Indemn Wins (The "Sales Engine" Argument):
They Price, We Sell. Akur8 creates the rate; The Revenue Engine sells it. A perfect pricing model is useless if the broker can't get a quote at 11 PM.

Positioning: They are the "Brain" (Pricing); we are the "Sales Engine" that connects their math to the broker.


Category C: The "Agency Automation" & RPA Rivals
Players: Quandri, Roots AI

Their Pitch: "We deploy digital workers (RPA bots) to handle high-volume data entry."

Why Indemn Wins (The "Reasoning" Argument):
RPA vs. AI: Quandri is excellent at moving data (Task Automation). Indemn is excellent at understanding context (Reasoning).

The Difference: We don't just "process the renewal"; The Retention Engine analyzes it for cross-sell opportunities and drafts a persuasive email.

We sell Retention & Growth, not just "hours saved."

Head-to-Head:
Quandri (The Bot): RPA - Mimics clicks. "Download policy from carrier portal"
Indemn (The Associate): GenAI + API. "Download policy, read it, explain exclusions to client"


Category D: The "RiskOps" & Workflow Workbenches
Players: Federato, Send

Their Pitch: "We are the 'RiskOps' platform for underwriter desktops."

Why Indemn Wins (The "Front-Line" Argument):
Federato manages the risk once it's inside. The Revenue Engine sits at the door, filtering the noise before it hits the workbench.

Positioning: They are the "Internal Workbench"; we are the "External Front Door."


Category E: The "Pipes" (Connectivity Infrastructure)
Players: Herald, Coverforce

Their Pitch: "One API to quote them all."

Why Indemn Wins (The "Intelligence" Argument):
Herald provides the road (API); Indemn provides the driver (The Revenue Engine).
Complex interactions requiring conversation need our reasoning layer, not just a static API call.


Category F: The "Extraction & Generation" Specialists
Players: Further AI, Lingura

Their Pitch: "We use GenAI to extract data from messy submissions."

Why Indemn Wins (The "Orchestrator" Argument):
Extraction is a Feature, Not a Product. Further AI extracts data. Indemn's Revenue Engine extracts data, then checks eligibility, then quotes, then binds.


COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

"AI is overhyped / I don't trust AI"

Response: "There's definitely a lot of hype. That's why we built Human-in-the-Loop from the ground up. The AI never guesses - if it's unsure, it drafts a response and queues it for your review. You retain 100% control."


"Is this going to replace my team?"

Response: "No. This is about Capacity, not replacement. Right now, your best underwriters are stuck doing data entry. We liberate them to focus on complex risks and broker relationships. We unblock the bottleneck so your team can do higher-value work."


"We tried chatbots before and they didn't work"

Response: "We hear that a lot. The difference is we're not selling a chatbot - we're selling a Revenue Engine. Generic chatbots don't understand binding authority or surplus lines. We're insurance-native. What specifically didn't work last time? Let's make sure we address that."


"We don't have budget for this"

Response: "I understand. Let me reframe: how many submissions did you decline last month simply because you didn't have time to review them? That's the cost of the status quo. The Revenue Engine captures that lost value. The question isn't whether you can afford it - it's whether you can afford to keep leaving money on the table."


"Our situation is too complex/unique"

Response: "Every company thinks they're unique - and in some ways they are. But the core problem - underwriters drowning in submissions, brokers waiting for answers - is universal. Can you tell me more about what makes your situation complex?"


"We need to go through procurement/legal"

Response: "Of course. We're happy to work through that process. What information do you need from us? We have security documentation and standard agreements ready. Many carriers have put us through their security review successfully."


"What about integration with our legacy systems?"

Response: "That's a common concern. We're API-first and integrate with AMS/PAS ecosystems like Guidewire and Vertafore without breaking your stack. Most deployments are live in about 60 days."


THE ECOSYSTEM PLAY

We sit in the Engagement Gap.

- Herald/Coverforce build the pipes
- Akur8/hx build the pricing
- Federato builds the workbench

Indemn is the intelligent Associate that connects them all. We are the only player focused on unblocking the conversation between the Broker and the Underwriter to drive Revenue Growth.
