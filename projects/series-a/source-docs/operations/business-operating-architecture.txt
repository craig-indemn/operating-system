Indemn Business Operating Architecture
Version 1.0 | February 2026

PURPOSE

This document defines how Indemn organizes itself as a corporation. It establishes the fundamental domains of the business, where information lives, and how it can be accessed by both humans and AI agents.

This is not about folder structure. It's about answering: "If someone (or something) needs to know X about Indemn, where do they go?"

────────────────────────────────────────

THE SEVEN DOMAINS

Every company has the same fundamental domains. What differs is how mature and organized each one is.

1. CORPORATE & GOVERNANCE
2. FINANCE & ACCOUNTING  
3. CUSTOMERS & REVENUE
4. PIPELINE & SALES
5. PRODUCT & ENGINEERING
6. GO-TO-MARKET
7. OPERATIONS & TEAM

────────────────────────────────────────

DOMAIN 1: CORPORATE & GOVERNANCE

What belongs here:
- Cap table (who owns what)
- Investor records (who invested, terms, contacts)
- Board materials (decks, minutes, resolutions)

────────────────────────────────────────

THE TWO-LAYER OPERATING SYSTEM

Indemn runs on a two-layer operating system designed for an AI-first company in 2026.

LAYER 1: SHARED BUSINESS OS
The company's collective memory and systems. Accessible to all executives.

Components:
- Google Drive (organized by the 7 domains above)
- Recorded Meetings → extracted and searchable via Meetings system
- Shared Slack Channels → company communication history
- Linear → engineering work and roadmap
- Pipeline → customers, deals, activities

This is the "company brain." When anyone asks "what do we know about X?" - the answer lives here.

LAYER 2: PERSONAL OS
Individual productivity layer. Private to each executive.

Components:
- Claude Code terminal (command-line AI interface)
- Personal email access (Gmail API)
- Personal Slack DMs
- Personal meeting recordings/transcripts (optional)

This is how each person interfaces with the business and their own work.

HOW IT WORKS TOGETHER

The Shared OS is the source of truth. The Personal OS is how you access it and augment it with your own context.

Example: Cam preparing for a customer call
1. Personal OS: "What do I need to know about [Customer]?"
2. Claude Code queries:
   - Pipeline API → customer record, deal status, recent activity
   - Google Drive → /Customers/[Customer] folder contents
   - Meetings → past call transcripts with this customer
   - Slack → recent messages in shared customer channel
3. Returns: Synthesized brief with context

Example: Kyle drafting investor update
1. Personal OS: "Help me draft this month's investor update"
2. Claude Code queries:
   - Pipeline → revenue, new deals, customer wins
   - Linear → product shipped this month
   - Meetings → board meeting notes
   - Personal email → any investor threads
3. Returns: Draft update with real data

────────────────────────────────────────

- See how recorded meetings become searchable context

Phase 2: Personal OS Setup (Week 2)
- Install Claude Code (command-line terminal)
- Connect personal Gmail
- Connect personal Slack
- Configure personal recording integration (optional)

Phase 3: Daily Use (Ongoing)
- Use Claude Code as primary interface
- Let AI retrieve context from both layers
- Contribute back to Shared OS (docs, updates, decisions)

────────────────────────────────────────

PERSONAL OS SETUP GUIDE (For Cam)

Prerequisites:
- Mac with terminal access
