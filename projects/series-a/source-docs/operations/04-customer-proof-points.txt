Quote Usage Guidelines

For investor materials:
- Always anonymize unless we have explicit permission
- "A large carrier customer" vs naming them
- Get approval before using any specific quote externally

For internal narrative development:
- Use names freely to track which proof points come from where
- Note: Some customers are at-risk (Family First) - use those stories carefully
