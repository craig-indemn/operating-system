POSITIVE QUOTES (107 total)
Best for testimonials, case studies, investor pitch:

"We are the agency. So we did our own version, saved $500,000 and produced 110 assets and hours of video"
— Steve Ramirez

"I've never seen this, you know, an insurance carrier saying yes, let's try something"
— Cam (referenced by Kyle) [Usable for: Case Study]

"After our last call, I wasn't really concerned. I think it was probably we were a little out of sync on what the questions were going to be asked and you guys obviously prepared for this, and I think we're in good shape."
— John Kreul [Usable for: Testimonial]

"We found a cheaper liability only policy elsewhere, but because of the ease of use and accessibility, they stuck with event guard."
— Mitchell Busse [Usable for: Testimonial]

"Can leverage existing code base for ~$250K vs original $2M development cost"
— [Usable for: Investor Pitch]

OBJECTIONS BY CATEGORY

Technical (30):
- Clarification needed on MGA licensing status
- Questioned the 10x conversion improvement claim
- LOI language gave JM rights to IP developed for other customers
- Concern about accuracy of conversion rate claims
- Concerned about rapidly evolving AI marketplace

Process (21):
- How do we know what optimal customer experience consumers actually want?
- Exclusivity terms are too broad
- Buyers hesitant to commit to additional software services
- Mitchell's pushback on separating event insurance agent from wedding agent
- JM requesting partnerships with Zola and The Knot as final diligence step

Pricing (18):
- Concern about 20-25% reduction from original LOI terms
- JM tech team not ready to commit $100K platform usage fee
- Risk imbalance between AI agent development costs ($150k labor) vs $100k proposal
- JM values the business at only $2 million instead of expected $5 million

Trust (13):
- Insurance carriers want to "see how it works first" before bigger commitments
- Uncertainty about whether consumers prefer conversational AI vs traditional forms
- JM doesn't seem excited about being ongoing customer
- Feels sweat equity not adequately reflected in deal structure

KEY DECISIONS (40 total)

Strategic:
- Tell Mitchell about JM conversations by framing as exploratory, not definitive sale
- Push back on JM to prioritize IP transfer process (most likely to derail deal)
- JM will pay for API builds for new affinity partnerships
- JM prefers fixed price structure over percentage of premium model
- Allow partner (JM) to draft first version of agreement

Product:
- Create two separate agents - one for homepage (full FAQ), one for Zola (engagement ring focused)

Technical:
- Wait for Ganesh to set up separate environment instead of using noisy demos environment

PROBLEMS & RESOLUTIONS

- IP ownership complexity → Agreed to document clear exclusivity for immediate adjacencies
- Over-technical responses → Cam assigned to monitor and redirect
- Contract "poison pills" → Identified three major risk categories, communicated contract is "unsignable"
- Wedding business doesn't fit traditional insurance metrics → Focus on revenue multiples instead
