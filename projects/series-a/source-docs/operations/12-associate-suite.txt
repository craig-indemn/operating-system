The Associate Suite

Our platform delivers four specific business outcomes: Revenue Growth, Operational Efficiency, Client Retention, and Strategic Control.

We do not sell "features" or "chatbots" - we sell Engines that drive business results.


THE REVENUE ENGINE (Priority Differentiator)

The Outcome: Unlocks capacity to capture missed revenue.

Example Capabilities:

24/7 Quoting & Binding
Executes full quote-to-bind workflows for brokers or consumers, capturing business outside of standard office hours.

Eligibility Triage
Instantly qualifies submissions against program appetite. Filters "out-of-appetite" risks so human underwriters focus only on bindable, high-value business.

Agent Portal Support
Guides independent agents through complex product guidelines directly within the portal, preventing "Not Taken Up" (NTU) submissions.

Best For:
- Mid-Market MGAs drowning in submissions
- Program Administrators needing to scale distribution
- Carriers with high NTU rates in agent portals


THE EFFICIENCY ENGINE

The Outcome: Liberates human staff from administrative drudgery and high-volume noise.

Example Capabilities:

Service Automation (Digital Receptionist)
Acts as a "digital receptionist" for agencies, instantly resolving high-volume tasks like Certificates of Insurance (COIs), billing inquiries, and document requests without human intervention.

Underwriting Guardrails
Enforces deterministic rules on every submission to ensure strict binding compliance and reduce error ratios.

Internal Knowledge Search
Acts as a "super-search" for internal staff, instantly retrieving answers from thousands of pages of policy forms and claims manuals.

Best For:
- Retail agencies with high service volume
- Carriers needing internal knowledge management
- Operations teams buried in admin work


THE RETENTION ENGINE

The Outcome: Protects the book of business and maximizes Lifetime Value (LTV).

Example Capabilities:

The "Silent Churn" Defender
Automatically reviews upcoming renewals to flag price spikes (e.g., >10%) and drafts proactive "remarket" or review emails for the agent.

Cross-Sell Identification
Scans existing policies during the renewal window to identify coverage gaps (e.g., bundling Auto with Home, missing Cyber coverage) and suggests specific cross-sell offers.

Lapse Prevention
Proactively contacts policyholders via text/email when payments are overdue to prevent cancellation.

Best For:
- Agencies wanting to protect their book
- Carriers focused on retention metrics
- Any organization with renewal revenue


THE CONTROL ENGINE

The Outcome: Provides operations leaders with visibility, agility, and governance.

Example Capabilities:

No-Code Agility (Strategy Studio)
Empowers program managers to update eligibility rules or launch new niche products in days, not months, without engineering support.

Distribution Analytics
Tracks exactly which brokers are quoting, converting, or dropping off in real-time.

Audit Trails
Complete visibility into every AI decision and human override.

Best For:
- Operations leaders needing control
- Compliance teams needing audit trails
- Program managers who want agility


THE SAFETY NET: HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP

This is foundational to everything we do.

We treat AI as a collaborative tool, not a "black box." Our Human-in-the-Loop architecture is the quality control layer that makes aggressive scaling safe.

How it works: When AI encounters high-risk or ambiguous situations, it queues a recommended response for human review. The AI never guesses - if it's unsure, it drafts and waits.

The benefit: You can scale aggressively without compromising compliance or trust.


HOW THE ENGINES CONNECT

The four engines share a single brain - one knowledge base trained on your products, guidelines, and workflows.

This means:
- Train once, deploy across use cases
- Cross-sell the Retention Engine after proving value with Revenue Engine
- No separate implementation projects for each capability
