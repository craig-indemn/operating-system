The Four Outcomes Framework

Created by Cam - Foundation for Everything We Build


The Core Insight

Every insurance distribution leader we talk to is trying to achieve one of four outcomes. Everything Indemn builds must clearly serve at least one.


The Four Outcomes

1. Revenue Growth
Unlock capacity to capture missed revenue

What this means: Agencies are leaving money on the table. Quotes that don't get followed up. Renewals that slip. Cross-sell opportunities missed. Revenue Growth means capturing what's already there.

How we deliver: Revenue Engine, Voice Agents that respond instantly, 24/7 availability

Proof points to find: "We couldn't keep up with..." / "Leads were falling through..." / "Now we can actually..."


2. Operational Efficiency  
Liberate staff from administrative drudgery

What this means: Skilled people doing data entry. Copying between systems. Answering the same questions repeatedly. Operational Efficiency means freeing humans for human work.

How we deliver: Efficiency Engine, automated workflows, intelligent routing

Proof points to find: "We used to spend hours..." / "Now it just happens..." / "Staff can focus on..."


3. Client Retention
Protect the book and maximize lifetime value

What this means: Existing clients are the foundation. Retention means proactive service, catching issues before they escalate, making clients feel valued.

How we deliver: Proactive outreach, analytics, renewal management

Proof points to find: "We caught it before..." / "Clients feel like..." / "Our retention rate..."


4. Strategic Control
Visibility, agility, and governance

What this means: Leaders need to see what's happening, respond quickly to changes, and maintain oversight. Strategic Control means dashboards, not darkness.

How we deliver: HIL system, analytics, governance tools

Proof points to find: "Now we can see..." / "We can respond to..." / "We finally have visibility..."


How to Use This

For Series A Narrative:
- Every claim should map to an outcome
- Every proof point should demonstrate an outcome delivered
- Structure the pitch around outcomes, not features

For Messaging:
- Lead with the outcome, not the product
- "Capture missed revenue" not "AI chatbot"
- Customer language, not tech language

For Evaluating Work:
- "Which outcome does this serve?"
- If it doesn't clearly serve one, question it


Language Rules

Use: Associate, Engine, Revenue Capacity, Digital Workforce, Partner

Avoid: Chatbot, Bot, Cost Savings (use Efficiency), Tool, Vendor
