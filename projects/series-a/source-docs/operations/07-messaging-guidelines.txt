Messaging & Communications Guidelines

Complete lexicon and sales principles for all Indemn communications.


THE CORE SHIFT

We are no longer just an "efficiency tool" that saves money. We are a Growth Partner that unlocks revenue capacity.

Old Narrative (Defensive): "We automate tasks to lower your operational costs."

New Narrative (Offensive): "We provide a digital workforce to unblock your distribution channels and capture missed revenue."

All content, sales pitches, and internal communications must align with the Four Outcomes framework.


THE LEXICON: WORDS MATTER

Stop Saying → Start Saying

"Chatbot" / "Bot" → "Associate" / "Engine"
Why: Bots are cheap and dumb. Associates are valuable team members.

"Cost Savings" → "Revenue Capacity"
Why: Savings are finite; Capacity is infinite. Leaders buy growth.

"Deflection Rate" → "Resolution Rate"
Why: "Deflection" sounds like avoiding the customer. "Resolution" sounds like helping them.

"Vendor" → "Partner"
Why: Vendors are replaced. Partners are integral to the strategy.

"Artificial Intelligence" → "Digital Workforce"
Why: "AI" is a buzzword. "Digital Workforce" implies labor, output, productivity.

"Tool" / "Software" → "Capability"
Why: Tools sit in a box. Capabilities change what a business can do.


THE BANNED LIST (Never Use)
- Chatbot / Bot
- Cost Savings / Cost Reduction
- Deflection Rate
- Tool / Software
- Vendor


THE REQUIRED LIST (Must Use)
- Associate or Engine (the product)
- Revenue Capacity (the value prop)
- Resolution Rate (the metric)
- Partner (our relationship)
- Capability or Digital Workforce (the category)


CORE VOICE & TONE

Voice: Modern and tech-forward, yet pragmatically grounded in insurance reality. We sound like Insurance Natives, not generic Silicon Valley startup.

Tone:
- Confident but not Arrogant: We know the industry has friction; we don't mock it, we fix it.
- Specific, not Abstract: Use industry terms (Binding Authority, NTU, Loss Ratio). Avoid fluff like "Digital Transformation."
- Collaborative: We are here to help the human underwriter, not replace them.


GUIDING SALES PRINCIPLES

Principle 1: Lead with "Revenue," Not "Efficiency"

Old: "We can help you reduce your call center costs."
New: "We can help you quote 50% more business without hiring a new underwriter."

Why: Efficiency is "table stakes." Revenue Growth is the differentiator.


Principle 2: Sell Outcomes, Not "The How"

Rule: Never start a sentence with "Our AI..." Start with "Your business..."

Don't say: "Our Growth Associate uses an LLM to read emails."
Say instead: "The Revenue Engine triages your submission inbox to ensure your underwriters only spend time on bindable business."


Principle 3: Frame AI as "Capacity" (The Augmentation Frame)

The Fear: "Is this going to replace my job?"

The Reframing: "No. This is about Capacity. Right now, your best underwriters are stuck doing data entry. We liberate them to focus on complex risks and broker relationships."

Key Phrase: "We unblock the bottleneck."


Principle 4: The "Safety First" Close

The Fear: "AI makes mistakes. I can't trust it."

The Response: Lean heavily into Human-in-the-Loop.

Script: "We agree. That's why our Control Engine acts as a safety net. The AI never guesses; if it's unsure, it drafts a response and queues it for your review. You retain 100% control."


BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS IN CONTENT

Anchoring (The "Lost Revenue" Anchor)
Don't anchor on the price of our software. Anchor on the cost of their inefficiency.
Example: "How many submissions did you decline last month simply because you didn't have time to look at them? That is the cost of the status quo."

Social Proof (The "Insurance-Native" Proof)
Prove we belong. Use specific case studies.
Example: "Mid-Market MGAs using The Revenue Engine typically see a 2x increase in submission capacity within 60 days."

Cognitive Ease (Simplicity)
Emphasize speed and simplicity to counter fear of complex IT project.
Key Phrases: "Quick time to production (~60 days)" and "streamlined deployment"


PITCHES BY SEGMENT

Mid-Market MGA:
Hook: "You are drowning in out-of-appetite submissions. We triage the inbox so you only underwrite bindable business."
Metric: "We will reduce 'out-of-appetite' reviews significantly in 60 days."

Retail Agency:
Hook: "Stop paying producers to process COIs. Let the Efficiency Engine handle the noise."
Constraint: Offer standardized solutions only; no custom builds.

Carrier:
Hook: "Your institutional knowledge is trapped in PDFs. We make it searchable instantly."
Safety: Emphasize Human-in-the-Loop for compliance comfort.


CONTENT CHECKLIST

Before sending any email, pitch deck, or proposal, verify:
[ ] Did I use the outcome names? (Revenue Engine, Efficiency Engine)
[ ] Did I avoid the banned words? (Chatbot, Tool)
[ ] Did I anchor on Revenue/Capacity? (Not just cost savings)
[ ] Did I reassure them with Human-in-the-Loop? (Safety Net)
[ ] Did I make it sound simple? (60 days to live)
