THINGS CLAUDE KNOWS (Context)

Without any tools, Claude already knows:
- The Four Outcomes framework
- Our messaging rules
- Series A status and metrics
- Customer names and context
- What "Associate" means vs "chatbot"

So you can ask:
"Does this paragraph align with our messaging?"
"Which outcome does this feature serve?"
"What's our positioning against [competitor]?"
