Series A Compendium - Master Reference

For Cam to use when building the narrative. This document compiles the best material from 395 meetings, strategic positioning docs, and customer evidence.

Note: This is a summary. The full 500+ line document is in indemn-series-a/series-a-compendium.md


PART 1: THE CORE POSITIONING

The One-Liner
"Indemn is the digital workforce for Insurance Distribution. We're capacity-constrained, not demand-constrained."

The Key Shift

Old Narrative (Competitors): "We automate tasks to lower your operational costs."

Indemn Narrative: "We provide a digital workforce to unblock your distribution channels and capture missed revenue."

Why this matters for investors: Most AI companies in insurance sell efficiency. We sell revenue growth. That's a different conversation entirely.

The Umbrella Example (clearest articulation of why we exist)
"Personal umbrella sales cost $50 in labor but only generate $25 in commission. It's economically irrational for humans to do this work. AI makes profitable outreach possible where human labor is too costly."

Use this: When anyone asks "why AI for insurance" — this is the answer.


PART 2: THE FOUR OUTCOMES

Everything we build serves one of these:

1. Revenue Growth — Unlock capacity to capture missed revenue
   Products: Revenue Engine, Voice Agents

2. Operational Efficiency — Liberate staff from administrative drudgery
   Products: Efficiency Engine

3. Client Retention — Protect the book and maximize lifetime value
   Products: Cross-sell, Renewal automation

4. Strategic Control — Visibility, agility, and governance
   Products: HIL System, Control Engine

For investors: Revenue Growth is the lead. The others are supporting cast.


PART 3: THE JEWELERS MUTUAL PROOF POINT

Why This Is Our Strongest Card:
"The first generative AI insurance acquisition in the industry."

They didn't buy a book of business. They bought:
1. An AI platform that sells insurance
2. A team that knows how to deploy it
3. Proof that AI can quote and bind

The Numbers:
- Total purchase price: $1.835M
- SaaS contract included: $300K (3-year)
- Earnout potential: $645K + 10% of every dollar after $1.35M
- Mike Alexander (President) calling directly about expanded usage

The Story Arc:
2021: Kyle starts Indemn with early GPT-3 access
2021-2024: Builds Event Guard MGA as AI testing lab
2024: Mitchell Busse moves to JM, recommends acquisition
2025: JM acquires Event Guard in competitive process
2026: JM now platform customer, expanding to commercial lines

For investors: This proves we can build AND sell an AI insurance business.


PART 4: THE CAPACITY CONSTRAINT STORY

This Is the Series A Pitch:
"Capacity is our only constraint. We have ~$1M ARR with 3 mega customers scaling from $1-2K/month to $100K/year. Growth is bottlenecked by team capacity (15 people), not demand."

The Evidence:
- Kyle meets every customer weekly
- Q1 bandwidth limits to 10 new clients
- 100+ applicants for 2 open roles
- 4 voice implementations running simultaneously
- Shurica paid $100K upfront, wants to expand

What $10M Unlocks:
1. Hire implementation capacity — 2x customer onboarding
2. Build tooling — Reduce time-to-live from weeks to days
3. Expand voice AI — Hottest demand area
4. Go-to-market — Sales team to capture the pipeline


PART 5: THE 5-YEAR MOAT

The Challenge:
"VCs believe building AI agents is 'relatively easy' now. Need to articulate unique secret sauce beyond Event Guard proof point."

The Response:
"Selling insurance with AI agents is the hardest thing to do."

What we have that can't be replicated:
- Started April 2021 with GPT-3 (before ChatGPT existed)
- 5 years of compliance patterns learned by doing
- Integration experience: EPIC, Hawksoft, Easy Links, Guidewire, Vertafore
- Human-in-the-loop architecture built for regulated industries
- Working production systems: GIC at 60%+ AI handling
- Acquisition by 110-year mutual insurer


PART 6: VOICE AS THE WEDGE

Every customer conversation now includes voice.

Current Voice Pipeline:
- Rankin: Feb 2 go-live, bilingual, after-hours + overflow
- Tillman: Pilot, bilingual English/Spanish
- Branch: 90-120 day POC, 3 call centers, targeting 50-60% conversion
- INSURICA: Expanding, multi-channel for C account renewals
- GIC: Expanding, web chat → voice → form replacement

Positioning: Voice is the hottest demand area. We have working bilingual voice agents in production. Most competitors are still doing text.


PART 7: CURRENT METRICS

ARR: ~$1M
Customers: 12 active
Weighted Pipeline: $1.74M (712 scored deals)
Team size: 15 people
Burn rate: ~$86K/month
Runway: 12 months

Comparable: Further AI raised $25M with $2.5M ARR


PART 8: LANGUAGE RULES

Use These Words:
- Associate (not Chatbot/Bot)
- Engine (not Tool)
- Revenue Capacity (not Cost Savings)
- Resolution Rate (not Deflection Rate)
- Partner (not Vendor)
- Digital Workforce (not AI)

Never Use:
- Chatbot / Bot
- Cost Savings / Cost Reduction
- Deflection Rate
- Tool / Software
- Vendor


HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

For Cam:
1. Lead with capacity constraint story
2. Use JM as primary proof point
3. Voice AI as the hot wedge
4. Revenue positioning, not efficiency
5. 5-year moat when they push on defensibility
