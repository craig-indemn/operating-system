Customer Stories Foundation

Material for Cam to shape the Series A narrative.
Distribution: 40% JM, 20% INSURICA, 20% GIC, 20% Union General


STORY 1: JM/EVENTGUARD (40% of discussion)

Headline: First generative AI insurance acquisition in the industry.

The Story:
We built EventGuard as our "MGA Lab" — proving AI-driven distribution works before anyone believed it could. A 110-year-old mutual insurer (Jewelers Mutual) saw the results and acquired the platform for $1.835M plus a $300K 3-year SaaS contract.

This wasn't an acqui-hire. They bought a working AI system that quotes and binds insurance. Now they want more — commercial lines RFP in pipeline.

The Numbers:
- Premium Growth: 330% YoY ($119K → $514K)
- Conversion Rate: 10X vs. traditional webforms
- Automation Rate: 95% of transactions fully automated
- Purchase Price: $1.835M
- SaaS Contract: $300K (3-year)
- Earnout Potential: $645K + 10% after $1.35M

The Extrapolation:
"If a 110-year-old carrier acquires our platform, every carrier will want this capability."

For Investors:
This proves we can build AND sell an AI insurance business. The acquirer is now a platform customer expanding to more products.


STORY 2: INSURICA (20% - The Renewals Story)

Headline: Top-50 mega agency automating C-account renewals.

The Story:
INSURICA started at $2K/month ($24K ARR). In 5 months, expanded to $89K TCV — 3.7x growth. They're taking back "C accounts" (bottom 20% of book) from a third-party vendor because our AI handles them better.

Julia Hester (decision maker) was "mind blown" at the voice demo. Targeting 25% reduction in human touches across 20+ staff.

The Numbers:
- Starting MRR: $2K/month ($24K ARR)
- Current TCV: $89K (3.7x growth in 5 months)
- Target: 25% reduction in human touches
- Staff Affected: 20+ people
- Next Expansion: Medicare Advantage (April 2026)
- Potential: 10x current deal size

The Extrapolation:
"If a mega agency scales AI across renewals, every agency will follow."

Customer Quote:
"Julia Hester at INSURICA called me right after the demo... she was ecstatic. Her mind was blown at the capabilities of our voice agents." — Kyle


STORY 3: GIC UNDERWRITERS (20% - Broker Resources)

Headline: MGA broker portal with 53% AI resolution rate.

The Story:
GIC had 6 CSRs drowning in routine broker inquiries. We deployed an AI agent ("Fred") in 7 days. Handling went from 19% to 46% in 60 days, now at 53% resolution. The CSRs went from skeptical to enthusiastic supporters.

The planned testing week never happened — they went straight to production because it worked.

The Numbers:
- Deployment Time: 7 days
- Initial Handling: 19%
- 60-Day Handling: 46%
- Current Resolution: 53%
- Accuracy: 95% maintained
- Volume: 300-400 conversations/week

The Extrapolation:
"If an MGA gets 53% resolution, the model works for every broker-facing operation."

Customer Quote:
"While our customer service team was initially skittish about adding AI, they're now enthusiastic supporters because they have fewer chats to handle, and it allows them to focus on more meaningful work." — Juan Carlos Diaz-Padron, CUO


STORY 4: UNION GENERAL (20% - Enterprise Upgrade)

Headline: 2-3 weeks → 2-3 minutes on insurance submissions.

The Story:
Union General had 350+ emails piling up in their Northland underwriting inbox with insufficient staff. They were losing 50%+ of quotes because response time was 2-3 weeks.

Started with $2K/month pilot, now at $84K ARR (3.5x growth). Integrated with GAIG API for multi-carrier support. 85% data extraction accuracy on complex trucking applications.

The Numbers:
- Before: 2-3 week response time
- After: 2-3 minutes (96%+ reduction)
- Starting MRR: $2K/month
- Current ARR: $84K (3.5x growth)
- Annual Labor Savings: $100K+ identified

Customer Quote:
"When you said that was two to three weeks, I was like, oh, this is a home run for us because we can make this two to three minutes." — George Remmer


STORY 5: NATIONWIDE (Pipeline)

Headline: 4-layer distribution architecture — Carrier → General Agent → Retail Agent → Customer.

Why It Matters:
- Pipeline Value: $1M+ product potential
- Connection: Kyle's friend leads Personal Alliance at Nationwide
- Shows multi-layer distribution capability
- Proof that our model scales to the largest players

The Extrapolation:
"This is the biggest opportunity for an insurtech right now and for at least the next 3 years."


CROSS-CUTTING THEME: VOICE AS THE WEDGE

- Tillman: Pilot, bilingual English/Spanish
- Branch: 90-120 day POC, 3 call centers
- INSURICA: Expanding, multi-channel

For Investors:
Voice is the hottest demand area. We have working bilingual voice agents in production. Most competitors are still doing text.
