The Four Outcomes
Indemn Product Strategy Foundation

What This Is

Everything we build should serve one of four customer outcomes. This framework (from Cam) helps us prioritize work, evaluate features, and communicate value.

Use this to evaluate any work: "Which outcome does this serve?"

The Four Outcomes

1. Revenue Growth
Definition: Unlock capacity to capture missed revenue

How we deliver:
- Revenue Engine (quoting, binding, payments)
- Voice Agents (handle more calls)
- Multi-channel coverage (web, voice, SMS, email)

Example work: EventGuard quote flow, voice implementations

2. Operational Efficiency
Definition: Liberate staff from administrative drudgery

How we deliver:
- Efficiency Engine (automation, workflows)
- CSR Copilot (AI suggestions)
- Platform Audit (simplify experiences)

Example work: Platform Audit initiative, RLHF improvements

3. Client Retention
Definition: Protect the book and maximize lifetime value

How we deliver:
- Proactive service capabilities
- Analytics and early warning
- Renewal workflows

Example work: Customer health monitoring, renewal automation

4. Strategic Control
Definition: Visibility, agility, and governance

How we deliver:
- Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) System
- Testing & Evaluation framework
- Analytics dashboards
- Observatory

Example work: T&E platform integration, HIL real-time monitoring

How to Use This

When Planning Work
Ask: "Which outcome does this serve?"
- If it serves none, question whether we should build it
- If it serves multiple, identify the primary outcome

When Prioritizing
Weight work by outcome urgency:
- Revenue Growth: Customer-facing, drives ARR
- Operational Efficiency: Internal capacity, scales team
- Client Retention: Protects existing revenue
- Strategic Control: Enables the other three

When Communicating
Lead with the outcome, not the feature:
- Bad: "We built a voice agent"
- Good: "We unlocked capacity to handle 3x more calls (Revenue Growth)"
