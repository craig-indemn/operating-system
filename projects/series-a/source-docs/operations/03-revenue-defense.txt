Series A Revenue Defense - Summary

As of January 27, 2026


The Story in One Sentence

We have $1M ARR today, $1.74M in weighted pipeline, and a methodology that's defensible under investor scrutiny.


Current ARR: ~$1M

12 paying customers across insurance distribution.


Weighted Pipeline: $1.74M

Our pipeline isn't just a list of names - every deal has been scored on 5 dimensions and weighted by stage probability.

By Stage:
- NEGOTIATION: 11 deals, $454K ARR, $244K weighted (54% probability)
- PROPOSAL: 1 deal, $60K ARR, $28K weighted (47% probability)
- DEMO: 3 deals, $165K ARR, $36K weighted (22% probability)
- DISCOVERY: 155 deals, $5.9M ARR, $589K weighted (10% probability)
- CONTACT: 543 deals, $18.5M ARR, $845K weighted (5% probability)

Total: 712 scored deals


The Scoring Methodology

Each deal is scored 1-5 on five dimensions:
1. Company Fit - Size, segment, tech readiness
2. Relationship Strength - Champion access, exec engagement
3. Eagerness/Urgency - Timeline, pain level
4. Use Case Clarity - Defined problem, clear scope
5. Milestone Progress - Demos completed, proposals sent

Composite Score = Average of 5 dimensions
Weighted Value = Expected ARR × Stage Probability × (Composite Score ÷ 5)


Why This Holds Up

For investors asking "how real is your pipeline?":

1. Every deal has been individually scored by AI + human review
2. We're conservative - CONTACT stage at 5%, not 10%
3. Methodology is documented and repeatable
4. We can show the work on any specific deal


Near-Term Upside

Negotiation deals ($244K weighted) should close in 30-60 days:
- These are real conversations with proposals out
- Multiple at $30K+ ARR each
- High confidence scores (3.5+ composite)
