Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)

Who we sell to, in priority order.


PRIORITY 1: MID-MARKET MGAs & PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS

The "Sweet Spot" - They have the underwriting authority ("the pen") to drive revenue and the agility to buy quickly.

Who They Are:
Specialty intermediaries with delegated underwriting authority. They typically manage niche programs (e.g., Trucking, Habitational, Cyber) and rely on a network of independent retail brokers for distribution.

Buying Persona:
Chief Underwriting Officer (CUO) or Head of Programs
- They care about "Loss Ratios" and "Submission Volume"
- Decision-making is faster than carriers
- Often have P&L responsibility for their programs

The Problem:
They are drowning in submissions. Human underwriters waste 60-70% of their time reviewing "out-of-appetite" business, missing the best opportunities.

The Solution:
Primary: The Revenue Engine (Eligibility Triage)
The AI instantly qualifies submissions against program guidelines. It declines the junk and prioritizes the "bindable" business.

Secondary: The Control Engine (Strategy Studio)
Allows them to update eligibility rules in real-time without IT tickets.

The Pitch:
"We don't just save time; we unlock capacity. We allow you to double your submission intake without hiring a single new underwriter."

Deal Characteristics:
- Deal Size: $40K - $100K ARR
- Sales Cycle: 2-4 months
- Key Objection: "Will brokers actually use it?"


PRIORITY 2: MID-MARKET RETAIL AGENCIES & BROKERAGES

High volume opportunities served via standardized, personalized solutions.

Who They Are:
Scaling independent agencies (typically $5M - $50M revenue) dealing with high-volume client service needs.

Buying Persona:
Agency Principal or VP of Operations
- They care about "EBITDA" and "Staff Retention"
- Often owner-operated
- Budget-conscious but willing to pay for real efficiency

The Problem:
Their highly paid producers are stuck doing minimum-wage work (issuing COIs, answering billing questions), leading to burnout and missed sales goals.

The Solution:
Primary: The Efficiency Engine (Digital Receptionist)
Handles the high-volume noise (COIs, billing, docs) instantly, freeing staff to sell.

Secondary: The Retention Engine (Silent Churn Defense)
Automates renewal review, proactively flagging risks before the client leaves.

Critical Constraint: Standardization
No custom builds for agencies under $50M revenue. Personalized standard solution.

The Pitch:
"Stop paying producers to process COIs. Let the Efficiency Engine handle the noise so your team can focus on selling."

Deal Characteristics:
- Deal Size: $15K - $40K ARR
- Sales Cycle: 1-2 months
- Key Objection: "We're too small" / Budget constraints


PRIORITY 3: INSURANCE CARRIERS

High value but long sales cycles. Engage for "Efficiency" and "Control" while nurturing long-term revenue partnerships.

Who They Are:
The risk bearers. Large, complex, slow-moving, but massive scale potential.

Buying Persona:
Chief Claims Officer, VP of Digital Transformation, or Innovation Leads
- Must navigate procurement, legal, and IT
- Often measured on cost reduction or NTU rates

The Problem:
1. Institutional knowledge is trapped in PDFs
2. High "Not Taken Up" (NTU) rates because agent portals are confusing

The Solution:
Primary (Internal): The Efficiency Engine (Knowledge Search)
"Internal Super-Search" for policy forms and claims manuals.

Primary (External): The Revenue Engine (Portal Support)
Embed the Associate in agent portals to guide brokers.

The Pitch:
"Your institutional knowledge is trapped in PDFs. We make it searchable instantly."

Deal Characteristics:
- Deal Size: $100K - $250K+ ARR
- Sales Cycle: 6-18 months
- Key Objection: Security/compliance, integration complexity


PRIORITY 4: STRATEGIC PARTNERS

Agency Management Systems (AMS), Policy Admin Systems (PAS), and Insurtechs.

The Opportunity:
Embed Indemn as the "Engagement Layer" on top of their systems.

The Pitch:
"We make your system conversational. Instead of clicking 50 buttons in your AMS to find a policy, they just ask the Indemn Associate."

The Value:
- Increases their user stickiness
- Gives us massive distribution leverage
- Win-win partnership model
