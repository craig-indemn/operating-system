Series A Collaboration Plan for Cam

Clear ownership split and timeline for Q1 angel raise + Series A.

Created: January 24, 2026


THE GOAL

The angel raise tests our narrative while we prep for the full Series A process.

THE PITCH STRATEGY

Angel Approach:
Pitch the Series A story, then explicitly offer:
"We're raising a $10M Series A. Here's what we're building and why now is the moment. By the way, we opened a small angel allocation at the same valuation — would you be interested in participating before we close it?"

This shows strength while giving angels a path in.


Q1 TARGETS (Ready to Contact)

John Doucette: $10K confirmed, ready to close
Jay Demucy: ~$50K potential, need to call
Bill Pierce: $25K, wants meeting
George Redenbaugh: Will invest, said yes


DILIGENCE TIERS

Tier 1: The Pitch (share first)
- Deck (10-12 slides)
- One-pager
- Customer stories (1-pager each)

Tier 2: Follow-up (same-day if asked)
- Financial model
- Deeper case studies
- Product architecture
- Team bios
- JM deal structure

Tier 3: Due Diligence (when requested)
- Cap table
- Legal docs
- Full financials
- Customer references

Rule: Only share what we decide. Prepared materials first. Custom requests same-day.


HOW CLAUDE CODE HELPS

Meeting extraction: Pulls proof points from calls automatically
Pipeline: Shows customer momentum in real-time
This project: Organizes all Series A materials

You can use these systems to:
- Find customer quotes when updating the deck
- Track investor pipeline
- Pull metrics for the narrative


WHAT NOT TO DO

- Don't present Claude Code as distraction from Series A (it's infrastructure for it)
- Don't make Series A decisions unilaterally (loop in before executing)
- Don't lead with AI story (use outcomes-based framing)
- Don't set vague goals (immutable milestones above)


This plan gives you material to shape, not decisions to approve. You lead the narrative.
