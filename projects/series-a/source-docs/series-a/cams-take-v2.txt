Indemn Series A Foundation, February 2026
The Hook: The Resolution Layer
Indemn is the Resolution Layer for Insurance Distribution. We deploy a Digital Workforce of specialized AI Associates that work alongside human teams to convert intent into bound premium. We are the infrastructure that wins regardless of who sits at the keyboard.

The Problem: The Distribution Friction Gap
The industry is stalled by a massive friction gap where 70% of underwriting capacity is wasted on non-productive work.

For Carriers: Strategic appetite is trapped behind manual processes and a lack of speed-to-market for digital initiatives.
For Distribution: Staff are drowning in administrative drudgery, causing $100M MGAs to operate at 30% efficiency.
The Result: This is not just a cost problem; it is a lost revenue problem that human-only teams cannot physically solve.
The Four Outcomes: Revenue-First Intelligence
We deliver results through specialized AI Associates. These are not "products" but Business Outcomes deployed as a service.

REVENUE GROWTH (The Growth Associate): Unlocks capacity to capture missed revenue via 24/7 quoting and eligibility triage. This is our highest differentiator; top-line growth always trumps efficiency during vendor consolidation.
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY (Policy & Service Associates): Liberates human staff from administrative drudgery by resolving high-volume tasks like COIs and billing instantly.
CLIENT RETENTION (The Renewal Associate): Protects the book and maximizes lifetime value by proactively identifying price spikes and coverage gaps.
STRATEGIC CONTROL (The Strategy Studio): Provides visibility and deterministic guardrails through a Human-in-the-Loop architecture.
The Moat: Insurance-Native Reasoning
Specialized Discipline: As proven by Jewelers Mutual, elite carriers recognize that leading-edge AI is an enabling discipline best delivered by a partner whose core value is the delivery of complex, insurance-specific outcomes.
Fail-Safe Governance: Our Human-in-the-Loop architecture meets the market’s near-term need for safety while building the infrastructure for long-term autonomous evolution.
The Consolidation Hedge: By leading with revenue, we position Indemn as the "must-have" infrastructure. When the market consolidates, the platform that "makes the market" is the one that survives.
The Proof: Validation at Scale
Jewelers Mutual: Acquired the EventGuard Revenue Outcome for its speed-to-market and 330% premium growth. They didn't buy a chatbot; they bought a result.
Land & Expand: We demonstrate a 3-5x expansion pattern by adding new capabilities to existing Associates (e.g., adding Renewal capabilities after a Service launch).
The Ask: $10M Series A
We are capacity-constrained, not demand-constrained.

Goal: Scale from $1.1M ARR to $15M ARR in 24 months.
Use of Funds: 40% Sales (capture $25M pipeline), 35% Engineering (deepen Associate capabilities), 15% Customer Success (drive expansion).
The Vision: Become the Resolution Layer that every insurance transaction flows through.
