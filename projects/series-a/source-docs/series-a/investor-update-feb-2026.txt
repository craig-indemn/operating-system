Hi [NAME],

Quick update - a lot has happened since we last talked.

THE PAYOFF

On January 8th, we closed and publicly announced the sale of EventGuard to Jewelers Mutual. 

This was the first generative AI insurance acquisition. A 110-year-old mutual insurer didn't buy a team - they bought a revenue-generating AI system. That's the category we're defining.

Deal terms: $1.835M upfront (includes $300K SaaS agreement), plus earnout and revenue share above targets.

THE MOMENTUM

Since the announcement, we've seen a surge:

New customers moving forward:
- Branch Insurance - proposal accepted, security review underway
- Rankin Insurance - voice AI going live this month (bilingual)
- Tillman Insurance - voice AI live, English/Spanish
- O'Connor Insurance - voice AI launching Feb 4
- Loro - partnership announced
- Borrowed Time, AMS - close to signing

Existing customers expanding:
- INSURICA: $24K → $89K (3.7x in 5 months)
- Union General: $2K pilot → $84K ARR
- GIC: 53% AI resolution rate (up from 19% at launch)

THE EVOLUTION

Voice is now our wedge. Every new customer conversation includes it. We're not just chat anymore - we're the full digital workforce for insurance distribution.

Where we are today:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ARR | $1.1M |
| Runway | 12+ months |
| Team | 15 |
| Customers | 12 |

We're capacity-constrained, not demand-constrained. Dozens of high-potential accounts we haven't been able to adequately pursue.

THE ASK

We're raising a $10M Series A. Cam has operations running - I'm now focused on fundraising full-time.

Target: term sheet by end of March.

Would you be able to intro us to any VCs in your network who focus on:
- Insurtech / insurance distribution
- Vertical AI / enterprise SaaS
- B2B marketplaces

[PERSONALIZED ASK - 2-3 specific VCs based on their network]

Even a warm forward of this email would help. Happy to jump on a call if useful.

Thanks for your continued support.

Kyle

FOLLOW-UP (Day 3):

Subject: Re: EventGuard Closed + What's Next

Hey [NAME] - wanted to bump this. Would any of those intros work? Even a quick "you should talk to Kyle" email would be huge.

Kyle

SEND ORDER (per Kyle's strategy):

Round 1 (Test): Tier C/D - smaller angels, family
- Get the motion working, see responses

Round 2 (Refine): Tier B - supportive investors  
- Adjust based on Round 1 feedback

Round 3 (Personalize): Tier A - Parker, Afterwork, VJ, Brian
- Highly personalized asks, specific VCs

---

QUESTIONS FOR CAM:

1. Tone - too long? Right balance of update vs ask?
2. The "evolution" framing - does it land?
3. Any VCs we should specifically ask certain investors about?
4. Should we mention the JM press tour / podcast requests more?
5. Follow-up timing - 3 days right?
