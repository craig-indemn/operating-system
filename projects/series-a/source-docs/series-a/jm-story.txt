The Experiment That Worked: Why Jewelers Mutual Acquired Our AI-Native MGA
In 2021, we had a controversial thesis: Generative AI wouldn't just automate insurance support; it would replace the "application form" entirely.
We called it the "Stock App Moment" for insurance—moving from static paperwork to dynamic, intelligent access. But the market wasn't ready to buy the software yet. They needed proof.
So, we built the proof ourselves.
From Lab to Leader We launched EventGuard, a wedding insurance MGA, as a "lab" to test the Indemn platform. We didn't build it to be a carrier; we built it to prove that an AI agent could outperform a human agent in sales, service, and underwriting discipline.
To do this, we used our platform to "digitize" the expertise of a veteran underwriter, Mitchell Busse. We didn't replace the human; we scaled him. Our system acted as a "Sales and Service Copilot," allowing one expert's logic to govern thousands of interactions simultaneously.
The results were undeniable:
Access: We unlocked 300+ partner venues who preferred our AI agent to traditional broker channels.
Conversion: We saw a 4.2x increase in full-package purchases because the AI could explain why coverage mattered.
Scale: We proved the "Human-in-the-Loop" model works at speed.
Validating the Blueprint Today, I am thrilled to announce that EventGuard has been acquired by Jewelers Mutual, a 112-year-old industry pillar.
Why did they buy it? Because they aren't just looking for wedding insurance; they are looking for the future of distribution. By acquiring EventGuard, JM is validating that AI Agents are the new standard for entering adjacent verticals.
What This Means for Indemn This acquisition is the graduation of our lab. It proves that our "Platform as a Blueprint" thesis is correct.
We took a complex specialty product, digitized the expert knowledge, and built a market leader. Now, Indemn is 100% focused on doing exactly that for the rest of the industry.
EventGuard was the first. It won’t be the last.
