# Indemn Deal Model Framework
## Series A Revenue Foundation

**Created:** January 25, 2026
**Purpose:** Establish repeatable deal structures for pipeline modeling and Series A projections
**Integrates:** Cam's GTM Strategy, Four Outcomes, Land & Expand 2.0


## ⚠️ UPDATED REVENUE MODEL (January 26, 2026)

**This section supersedes the projections below. Numbers updated for Series A narrative.**

### Current State: $1M ARR

| Bucket | ARR | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| JM/EventGuard (SaaS + Transaction) | $820K | $100K SaaS + $720K transaction revenue |
| Land & Expand (Enterprise) | $305K | INSURICA, Union General, GIC, Distinguished, eSpecialty |
| Independent Agents | $68K | Bonzah, Surety First, Authentic, etc. |
| **Total** | **~$1.2M** | Defensible baseline for Series A |

### Growth Trajectory

| Milestone | ARR | How We Get There |
|-----------|-----|------------------|
| **Now** | $1M | Current contracted + JM transaction revenue |
| **Organic (12 mo)** | $3M | Existing customer expansion + 15-20 new Middle Market |
| **With Series A** | $6M | +25 new customers, whale pursuit, capacity unlock |
| **End 2027** | $8M | Full land & expand at scale |
| **End 2028** | $20M | Enterprise + revenue engine replication |

### The Math

**Organic to $3M (without Series A):**
- Existing expansion: $1M → $1.6M (+$600K from INSURICA, Union General, GIC scaling)
- 15 new Middle Market @ $60K avg: +$900K
- 10 new Starter @ $24K avg: +$240K
- JM transaction growth: +$260K
- **Total: ~$3M**

**With Series A to $6M:**
- Organic base: $3M
- +25 additional customers (sales team capacity): +$1.5M
- 2-3 whale deals (Nationwide, carrier targets): +$750K
- Revenue engine replication (Protective, Physicians Mutual): +$500K
- Accelerated expansion: +$250K
- **Total: ~$6M**

### Whale Targets (Series A enables pursuit)

| Target | Opportunity | Stage |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Nationwide | $1M+ | 4-channel architecture, active discussions |
| Aon | $500K-$1M | Large broker opportunity |
| Gallagher | $500K-$1M | Distribution platform play |
| Zurich | $500K-$1M | Carrier efficiency opportunity |
| Marsh | $500K-$1M | Enterprise broker |
| Liberty Mutual | $500K-$1M | Carrier platform |

### Revenue Engine Replication

The EventGuard model (transaction-based revenue from AI-driven policy sales) is replicable:

| Target | Opportunity | Why Them |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Protective | Revenue engine | Affinity distribution focus |
| Physicians Mutual | Revenue engine | Direct-to-consumer model |
| Navy Mutual | Revenue engine | Membership-based distribution |

Each successful revenue engine deal adds $500K-$2M in transaction revenue potential.

## The Three Deal Tiers

| Tier | TCV Range | ARR Range | Volume | Example |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Starter (PLG)** | $12K-$36K | $12K-$24K | High (50+/year) | Voice agents, single Associate |
| **Middle Market** | $60K-$150K | $60K-$85K | Medium (15-20/year) | Branch pattern, multi-Agent |
| **Enterprise** | $250K-$1M+ | $100K-$250K+ | Low (3-5/year) | Nationwide, JM expansion |

---

## Tier 1: Starter / PLG Deals ($12K-$36K TCV)

### The Pattern
Quick wins, voice-first, single use case. Land fast, prove value, create expansion opportunity.

### Structure
| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| **Monthly fee** | $1K-$3K/month |
| **Setup** | Minimal or waived |
| **Contract term** | Month-to-month or 6 months |
| **ARR** | $12K-$36K |

### Examples
- **Rankin Insurance:** $18K ARR (voice agents, Feb 2 go-live)
- **O'Connor Insurance:** $18K ARR (billing agent)
- **Family First:** $12K ARR (advisory agent)

### Why This Matters
- **High volume acquisition:** 50+ deals/year possible
- **Voice as wedge:** Every customer conversation now includes voice
- **Expansion path:** Starter → Middle Market (3.7x INSURICA, 3.5x Union General)
- **Low implementation cost:** Zero-to-low, usage-based success

### Cam's Framework Alignment
- **Wedge:** "Stop the Admin Noise" — Digital Receptionist
- **Engine:** Efficiency Engine (single function)
- **Constraint:** Standard product, no custom workflows under $50K

---

## Tier 2: Middle Market ($60K-$150K TCV)

### The Pattern (Branch Model)
Pilot to prove value, then enterprise commitment. This is our **focus deal structure**.

### Structure
| Phase | Duration | Investment | Cumulative |
|-------|----------|------------|------------|
| **Pilot** | 3 months | $2K/month = $6K | $6K |
| **Year 1** | 12 months | $25K upfront + $5K/month = $85K | $91K |
| **Steady-State ARR** | Ongoing | $5K/month = $60K/year | — |

### Why $91K TCV Works
1. **Pilot de-risks:** Customer proves value before commitment
2. **Upfront captures commitment:** $25K signals real investment
3. **Monthly creates predictability:** $5K/month is budget-friendly
4. **Expansion headroom:** Room to grow to $150K+ with additional agents

### Examples
- **Branch Insurance:** $91K TCV ($6K pilot + $85K year 1)
- **INSURICA:** $89K TCV (started $24K, 3.7x growth in 5 months)
- **Union General:** $84K ARR (started $24K, 3.5x growth)

### The Repeatable Motion
1. **Land:** Single engine solving bleeding-neck problem
2. **Prove:** 90-day pilot with clear success metrics
3. **Commit:** $25K upfront + ongoing monthly
4. **Expand:** Add engines, agents, channels

### Cam's Framework Alignment
- **Hook:** "Unblock Distribution" or "Stop the Admin Noise"
- **Wedge:** Revenue Engine (Eligibility Triage) or Efficiency Engine (Service)
- **Expansion:** Cross-sell to Retention, add channels
- **Metric:** "We will reduce X significantly in 60 days"

---

## Tier 3: Enterprise ($250K-$1M+ TCV)

### The Pattern
Strategic accounts with multi-year, multi-channel deployments. Platform deals, not point solutions.

### Structure
| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| **Platform fee** | $100K-$250K/year |
| **Implementation** | $50K-$150K (one-time) |
| **Volume/success fees** | Variable based on outcomes |
| **Contract term** | 2-3 years |
| **Total TCV** | $250K-$1M+ |

### Examples
- **Jeweler's Mutual:** $2.135M+ (acquisition + SaaS + earnouts)
- **Nationwide (pipeline):** $1M+ (4-channel distribution architecture)
- **Carrier expansion deals:** $250K+ (multi-engine deployment)

### The Nationwide 4-Channel Model
```
CARRIER (Nationwide)
    ↓
GENERAL AGENT (Indemn customer - GIC pattern)
    ↓
RETAIL AGENT (Easy submission through GA)
    ↓
CUSTOMER (Full AI-powered access)
```

Each layer is a revenue opportunity. We power all four.

### Cam's Framework Alignment
- **Hook:** "Operational Efficiency" → expand to "Agent Portal Support"
- **Wedge:** Efficiency Engine (Internal Knowledge Search) — low risk entry
- **Expansion:** Once Engine proves it knows guidelines, promote to external
- **Pricing:** Base Platform + Transaction Volume

## TWO PATHS: With and Without Series A

### PATH 1: Without Series A (Organic Growth)

**What we can do with current resources:**

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **ARR** | $766K | $1.0-1.2M | Organic expansion + 5-8 new Middle Market |
| **Customers** | 15 | 22 | Steady growth |
| **Team** | 15 | 18 | Modest hiring |
| **Enterprise Deals** | 1-2 | 2-3 | Opportunistic |

**Constraints:**
- Limited sales capacity (Kyle + 1-2 AEs)
- Implementation bottleneck (can't onboard >15 customers/year)
- Enterprise deals require patience (no dedicated enterprise team)
- Voice PLG limited by engineering capacity

**The Story:**
"We're profitable and growing. We've proven the model works. We can reach $1M ARR organically, but we'll miss the market window."

---

### PATH 2: With Series A ($15M)

**What becomes possible with capital:**

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **ARR** | $1.5M | $4M | $10M | Accelerated growth |
| **Customers** | 30 | 75 | 150 | Scale operations |
| **Team** | 25 | 45 | 70 | Strategic hiring |
| **Enterprise Deals** | 3-5 | 8-10 | 15+ | Dedicated pursuit |

**Investment Allocation:**

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Go-to-Market** | $6M | Sales team (5 AEs), marketing, demand gen |
| **Product & Engineering** | $5M | Voice acceleration, enterprise features, integrations |
| **Customer Success** | $2M | Implementation capacity, expansion team |
| **Operations** | $2M | Infrastructure, compliance, G&A |

**What Changes:**

1. **Sales Capacity**
   - Current: Kyle + referrals
   - With Series A: 5 AEs hunting Middle Market + Enterprise team
   - Impact: 3x deal velocity

2. **Implementation Capacity**
   - Current: 10-15 customers/year max
   - With Series A: 50+ customers/year
   - Impact: Remove growth bottleneck

3. **Enterprise Pursuit**
   - Current: Opportunistic (Nationwide came to us)
   - With Series A: Dedicated team pursuing $250K+ deals
   - Impact: Land 3-5 enterprise deals/year

4. **Voice PLG**
   - Current: Manual onboarding
   - With Series A: Self-serve voice deployment
   - Impact: 50+ Starter deals/year with minimal touch

---

### The Series A Ask

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Amount** | $15M |
| **Valuation** | $60-75M pre-money |
| **Use of Funds** | GTM (40%), Product (33%), CS (13%), Ops (13%) |
| **Milestone** | $10M ARR by end of Year 3 |
| **Term Sheet Target** | End of March 2026 |

### Why Now?

1. **Proof Points in Place**
   - JM acquisition validates platform value ($2.1M+)
   - 3.5x average expansion within accounts
   - Voice traction (every customer conversation includes it)

2. **Market Window Open**
   - Insurance AI is hot but fragmented
   - We have working production deployments (not vaporware)
   - First mover in agentic voice for insurance

3. **Enterprise Pipeline Ready**
   - Nationwide 4-channel: $1M+ opportunity
   - JM expansion: Commercial lines RFP
   - Pattern proven, need capacity to pursue

4. **Competition Moving**
   - Generic AI players entering insurance
   - We have domain expertise + customer proof
   - Capital accelerates moat building

---

### The Pitch Summary

**Without Series A:**
"We'll reach $1M ARR organically, growing steadily with Middle Market deals. Profitable but constrained."

**With Series A:**
"We accelerate to $10M ARR in 3 years by scaling sales, removing implementation bottlenecks, and pursuing enterprise deals. We capture the digital distribution opportunity before the window closes."

**The Choice for Investors:**
Proven model + clear path + market timing = attractive risk/return profile
