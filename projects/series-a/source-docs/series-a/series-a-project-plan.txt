# Series A Project Plan

Created: January 26, 2026
Status: Draft - awaiting Kyle/Cam alignment

---

## 1. Purpose

We are preparing Indemn for a Series A raise by aligning on:
- A single narrative
- Top customer ladder + expansion plan
- A demo that proves the thesis
- A 30-day "professionally persistent" push that generates market signal and validates ARR trajectory

---

## 2. Narrative (Working Thesis)

Indemn is building a controlled, multi-channel AI communications worker for insurance (phone, email, web chat), with a policy layer that governs autonomy and compliance.

Autonomy Settings (v1):
1. Highly Active - Proactive outbound, follow-ups, reminders, nudges (like a junior SDR/CSR)
2. Professionally Persistent - Structured follow-up cadence + retry logic (the killer differentiator)
3. Baseline - Reactive, answers questions, logs everything (table stakes)
4. Minimum Documentation Required - Compliance-safe mode (proves we understand regulated comms)

Framing: "Same agent. Four trust levels."

---

## 3. Fundraising Bar & Intent

We will operate as a $1M ARR company (current + contracted + committed expansions with evidence).

The Line:
- If we cannot credibly support $1M ARR, we should delay Series A
- This is not booked revenue only - it includes expansion that is:
  - Already priced
  - Already discussed
  - Already in flight

Target Raise: $10M (working, subject to narrative + metrics)

---

## 4. The Customer Ladder (To Be Filled with Kyle + Cam)

### Tier 1: Home Runs (3-5)
These define what we are.

| Customer | Current ARR | Expansion Path | Why Strategic |
|----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| TBD | | | |
| TBD | | | |
| TBD | | | |

### Tier 2: Scale Candidates (3-5)
These define what we will be.

| Customer | Current ARR | Expansion Path | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| TBD | | | |
| TBD | | | |

### Tier 3: Pattern Proof
These prove it's not luck.

| Category | Example Customers |
|----------|-------------------|
| Independent agencies | |
| MGAs | |
| Embedded programs | |

---

## 5. 30-Day Execution Plan (The Gorilla Push)

Primary Objective: Prove "professionally persistent" outbound behavior and generate signal density.

Outputs by end of 30 days:
1. A ranked top customer ladder (Tier 1/2/3) with quantified expansion paths
2. A renewal/outbound cadence playbook (human-run first)
3. A demo showing one "hero behavior" (renewal follow-up / inbound qualification / stalled deal revival)
4. Evidence pack: activity, responses, meetings booked, pipeline movement, expansion commits

---

## 6. Demo Plan: Insperica Renewal

Goal: Demonstrate "one agent, four trust levels" with hard boundaries + professional persistence.

Demo Flow (10-12 minutes):
1. Baseline: Inbound question answered + logged
2. Professionally Persistent: Follow-up cadence triggered + safe language
3. Minimum Documentation: Refuses/defers where needed + requests missing facts
4. Highly Active: Proactive outreach within strict policy rails
5. Handoff: Escalates to human with summarized context

---

## 7. What We Need from the Team

### Cam (Narrative/GTM)
- [ ] 1-page narrative skeleton (problem → insight → solution → proof)
- [ ] Pick "hero behavior" for demo and for the 30-day push
- [ ] List top 10 investor talking points → cut to top 3

### Product/Eng
- [ ] Define policy layer + autonomy controls (what is allowed/blocked)
- [ ] Spec the "request object" pattern for missing info + API calls
- [ ] Create demo scripts + test data

### Sales/CS
- [ ] Top customer ladder draft + expansion hypotheses
- [ ] Renewal/outbound cadence templates
- [ ] List of "most repeated customer questions" (API candidates)

---

## 8. Decisions Required This Week

- [ ] Declare the hero behavior for demo + for the month
- [ ] Confirm the $1M ARR credibility (what counts, what doesn't)
- [ ] Decide the top 5 customers that define the company story
- [ ] Align incentives/roles for the 30-day push (who owns what)

---

## 9. Next Actions (48 Hours)

| Action | Owner | Due |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Create customer ladder doc + prefill Tier 1 with current ARR + expansion notes | Kyle | Jan 28 |
| Narrative v1 (1 page) + fundraising target framing | Cam | Jan 28 |
| Autonomy policy layer v0 + demo environment checklist | Eng | Jan 30 |
| 30-day cadence plan + activity metrics definition | Sales | Jan 30 |

---

## 10. Data Model for Team Sharing

Every customer relationship is a pipeline driven by communication events:

CONVERSATION (event)
   - call / email thread / chat session / meeting
   - raw transcript + metadata (who, when, account, topic)

ARTIFACT (interpretation)
   - summary (what happened)
   - decisions (what we agreed)
   - tasks (next steps)
   - risks (blockers)
   - requests (what we need from them / from us)

ACTION (execution)
   - outbound follow-up sent
   - internal task created/assigned
   - API request queued
   - next meeting scheduled

OUTCOME (result)
   - response received
   - stage moved
   - renewal saved
   - expansion committed
   - deal closed / churn avoided

Our platform's unique leverage: We can industrialize steps 2 and 3.

## 11. Baselines (Start with 6 Numbers)

### Speed Baselines (Persistence)
| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| TTS | Time-to-Summary: minutes from call end → summary posted | < 30 min |
| TTF | Time-to-Follow-up: minutes from call end → follow-up drafted/sent | < 2 hours |
| TTN | Time-to-Next-step: hours from call end → tasks assigned + due dates set | Same day |

### Coverage Baselines (Completeness)
| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Capture rate | % of customer calls that become artifacts | 95% |
| Follow-up rate | % of calls that generate at least 1 outbound follow-up | 80%+ |
| Task rate | % of calls that produce assigned tasks | 70%+ |

### Quality Baselines (Usefulness)
| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Actionability score | Did artifact include: recap + decisions + next steps + owner? | 3.5/4 avg |
| Response rate | % of follow-ups that get a reply within 7 days | Improving trend |

---

## 12. The "Immediate Assistant" Vision

Post-Call Ops Copilot (internal first, customer later):

Trigger: Call ends → transcript appears.

Within 10 minutes, the assistant produces:
- Customer-facing follow-up draft (ready to send)
- Internal next-step list with owners + due dates
- Open questions / missing info as structured "Request Objects"
- CRM update suggestion (stage, next meeting, notes)

Within 2 hours, it nags the owner (professionally persistent):
- If no send / no tasks assigned: 2 reminders then escalation

This aligns with the autonomy ladder concept - except applied internally where we control everything.

To be shared with Cam and team.
