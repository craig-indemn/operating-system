Cam's Take - Indemn Series A Foundation: 
Insurance Resolution Layer

1. VISION & IDENTITY: THE DIGITAL WORKFORCE
Indemn is the Resolution Layer for Insurance Distribution. We deploy a Digital Workforce of specialized AI Associates that understand the complex logic of insurance and work alongside human teams to convert intent into bound premium.

The Strategic Insight: We are the infrastructure that wins regardless of who sits at the keyboard.
The Native Advantage: We deliver specialized insurance intelligence as an enabling discipline, allowing carriers and MGAs to focus on their core value while we resolve the transaction.
Outcome over Product: We do not sell tools; we deliver Business Outcomes.
2. THE PROBLEM: THE DISTRIBUTION FRICTION GAP
Insurance distribution is stalled by a massive friction gap: 70% of underwriting capacity is wasted on non-productive work.

For Carriers: Strategic appetite is trapped behind slow, manual processes and a lack of speed-to-market for new digital initiatives.
For Distribution: Staff are drowning in administrative drudgery, causing $100M MGAs to operate at 30% efficiency.
The Consequence: This friction represents lost revenue that current human-only teams cannot physically capture.
3. THE FOUR OUTCOMES: REVENUE-FIRST INTELLIGENCE
We deliver results through specialized AI Associates. These are not "products" you buy; they are capabilities you deploy to achieve specific business results.


THE OUTCOME
	THE ROLE OF THE ASSOCIATE
	STRATEGIC VALUE

REVENUE GROWTH
	Unlocks capacity to capture missed revenue via 24/7 quoting and eligibility triage.

	Primary Differentiator. Revenue-generating capabilities always outlast efficiency tools in vendor consolidation.


OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY
	Liberates human staff from administrative drudgery by resolving service tasks (COIs, billing) instantly.

	Converts fixed costs into scalable, automated resolutions.


CLIENT RETENTION
	Protects the book and maximizes lifetime value by identifying price spikes and coverage gaps.

	Defends the current portfolio while seeking organic growth.


STRATEGIC CONTROL
	Provides visibility and deterministic guardrails through a Human-in-the-Loop architecture.

	Ensures compliance by design; the AI never "guesses" on binding authority.

4. THE STRATEGIC HEDGE: WHY WE WIN EITHER WAY
Indemn is not just a bet on a single distribution model; it is a bet on the infrastructure that underlies all of them.

Today (Support and Thrive): We empower the traditional distribution chain. Brokers and agents use our AI Associates to remain competitive and scale in a high-volume digital world.
Tomorrow (The Function Gap): If market forces shift consumers away from traditional agents, a massive "Function Gap" opens in distribution.
The Pivot: Because Indemn’s Associates already own the underwriting logic and the customer interface, we are perfectly positioned to step into that gap. We don’t just support the market; we can make the market directly.
Investor Upside: Traditional distribution thrives, we win (we are their digital workforce). Consumers go direct, we win (we are the resolution layer they need).
5. THE MOAT: DOMAIN SPECIFICITY
The Fail-Safe Approach: Our Human-in-the-Loop architecture is a critical control for institutional engagement. It meets the market’s near-term need for safety while preparing the infrastructure for long-term autonomous evolution.
The Partner Thesis: As proven by Jewelers Mutual, elite carriers recognize that leading-edge AI is an enabling discipline best delivered by a partner whose core value is the delivery of complex, insurance-specific outcomes.
6. THE ASK: $10M SERIES A
We are capacity-constrained, not demand-constrained.

Funding Priorities: Scaling the Sales force (40%) to capture a $25M pipeline and Engineering (35%) to deepen the capabilities of our AI Associates.
The Roadmap: Scaling from $1.1M ARR to $15M ARR by becoming the intelligence layer that every policy flows through.
Key Soundbites for Investors
"We are the infrastructure that wins regardless of who sits at the keyboard".
"We empower the traditional broker to survive today and own the interface if the consumer goes direct tomorrow".
"SaaS is a delivery method; Resolution is the business outcome".
"Jewelers Mutual didn't buy a chatbot; they bought a revenue engine".
