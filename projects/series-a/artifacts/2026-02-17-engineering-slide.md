# SLIDE: The Engineering Moat

**Headline:** Deep insurance expertise meets state-of-the-art AI engineering. We know what to automate — and we have the team to build it as fast as the technology evolves.

---

**The core business:** AI agents handling real insurance workflows in production — quoting, customer service, sales, underwriting support — across 65 organizations. 2M+ messages. 55 agents active today.

**What makes this defensible:** Indemn isn't just deploying AI into insurance. The engineering team develops state-of-the-art agentic systems and integrates every meaningful AI advancement as it emerges. New model with better reasoning? It's in our agents that week. New capability like browser automation? We're already building operators that work inside Applied Epic. The gap between what's possible in AI and what Indemn ships to customers is measured in days.

**What the team has built:**

- **Web Operators** — AI agents that go beyond conversation into action. They operate inside the enterprise software agencies run their businesses on — completing policy renewals, processing applications, executing the manual workflows that consume agency staff today. Self-learning: each run improves the next.

- **Observatory** — The intelligence layer across every agent and every customer. Automatically analyzes every conversation, identifies what's driving outcomes, and feeds that insight back into agent improvement. Live in production, thousands of conversations analyzed. No other company in our space has this.

- **Autonomous Evaluation** — AI that builds comprehensive test suites for customer agents, runs simulated conversations, scores performance, and identifies exactly what to fix. Quality assurance that scales with the platform, not with headcount.

---

**The insight:** Insurance distribution is built on manual labor — conversations, data entry, reviews, follow-ups. Indemn is automating the full loop: the customer conversation, the back-office transaction, the quality monitoring, and the continuous improvement cycle. We run our own company the same way — our internal workflows use the same agentic automation we build for customers.

**At scale:** Every agency, MGA, and carrier runs the same core workflows. What works for GIC Underwriters today works for thousands of organizations tomorrow. A 4-person engineering team with deep insurance knowledge and frontier AI capability is the engine — and every new AI advancement makes that engine more powerful.
