# Technology & Team

Indemn builds AI agents that handle insurance workflows — quoting, customer service, sales, underwriting support. 55 agents in production today across 65 insurance organizations, handling over 2 million messages to date.

The engineering team combines deep insurance domain knowledge with the ability to develop and deploy new AI capabilities as they become available. Three recent examples:

**Conversation Analytics (Observatory)**
Every conversation across every customer is automatically analyzed — outcomes, intent, sentiment, and the specific factors that predict whether a conversation will resolve or fail. This gives Indemn and its customers operational visibility that doesn't exist anywhere else in insurance AI. In production, analyzing thousands of live conversations.

**Automated Quality Assurance**
An AI system that reads a customer's agent configuration, generates comprehensive test scenarios, builds scoring criteria, and runs evaluations — without engineering involvement. This is how Indemn maintains agent quality across a growing customer base without linearly scaling the team.

**Enterprise Software Automation (Web Operators)**
AI agents that operate directly inside legacy insurance platforms like Applied Epic — completing policy renewals, processing applications, and executing workflows that agencies currently do by hand. This extends Indemn's value from the customer conversation into the back-office transaction.

**Why this matters:**

Insurance distribution is a $140B+ market built almost entirely on manual processes — people answering phones, entering data, reviewing applications, following up on renewals. Every agency, MGA, and carrier runs the same core workflows.

Indemn is the only company that can automate the full cycle: the customer-facing conversation, the back-office execution, the quality assurance, and the continuous improvement loop — all with AI agents. The team has built this infrastructure with 4 engineers, and it runs internally the same way it runs for customers.

Every new AI capability that reaches the market makes this platform more powerful. The team has a track record of putting those capabilities into production within days of availability.
