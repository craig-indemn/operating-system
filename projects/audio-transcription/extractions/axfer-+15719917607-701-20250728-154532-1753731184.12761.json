  "summary": "A 64-year-old diabetic caller sought life insurance options with lower costs than a previous quote. The agent explained that $100,000 is the minimum term coverage available through their carrier, resulting in ~$68/month for a 20-year term. The caller found this too expensive and inquired about lower amounts, but the agent confirmed $100k is the minimum. Whole life insurance was presented as an alternative, though more expensive. The caller remains undecided and may need further consideration.",
