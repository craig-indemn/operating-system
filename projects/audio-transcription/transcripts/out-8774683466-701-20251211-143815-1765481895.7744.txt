How we can assist you today? Yes, Ramon. I am with Alliance Insurance Services. My name is Jeremy, calling from North Carolina. And I have a policy number I need you to take a look at with me, please. Okay. It is I'm ready. All right, two zero three. Two two seven seven three three zero dash zero zero. The account name is Kennedy Culbertson. Okay, got that information there. How we can assist? So it looks like her premium went up, and I'm wanting to make sure that. The reason I'm trying to understand why it went up. It looks to me based on what the endorsement shows that was mailed out on November 21st to her. Was that proof of prior bodily injury limits and continuous insurance? Correct. Let me review one one second. Sure. That's correct. That's two hundred and six dollars. And let me review when we received this proof one moment. November 21. Okay, what? November. Let me try to adjust it one second. November 21, November 20. One second. Okay. Excuse you. Thanks. Thanks. Welcome. One second, sir. I'm I'm trying to adjust the premium. Okay, because you did see the proof of bodily injury that I had uploaded already and the continuous insurance for six months. Is that correct? Yeah, that. Okay, it's in receipt already. It's in receipt. When when they receive that, you know for some reason they do not adjust the premium. Because we received up on this when the premium was already increased. And you know they we missing to do an extra step to adjust the premium again. Okay. And that's what I'm that's what I'm trying to do right now. Okay, excellent. Sir. Two twenty three to book your car details. November 21. Two hundred six. Proof of prior bodily injury limits. Proof of prior. One second, sir. The system do not allow me. Just give me more time. Okay, sure. Thank you. I'm sorry. No problem. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Container. Container. Container. Container. Driver. Three six twenty four. Not at fault. Dismissed. Dispute. Full force. Okay. Two hundred six. Yes, sir. The system do not allow me to do it, and let me explain you why. I I need to contact another department, but let me also explain you at the beginning of the policy when the policy was created on November 20. The customer MBR just pulled one comprehensive loss that is zero points. That is no point on it, and then on on that specific day. On the 21, the system pulled the the more. More information. It pulled another accident that is foul not determined, and we got that not at fault accident. Three six two thousand and twenty four. That's the only difference that I see. When the policy was created and what is what it is right now. The the system showed that the written of increase. Was those documents, but that that mean that changed the driver history. You see on the policy. That say changed Kennedy Culbertson driver history information. The MBR pulled those items. And the documents also show. Proof of prior proof of continuous insurance was requested, but that for December 4. And this is November 21, so the document that that we see on the PDF is advising. About that we need we missing proof by December 4, but it is not past due yet. So the the main reason is is the additional accident that is showing on the system now. That is impacting the premium with two hundred six. Even though it's not at fault, it's it's charging her more premium for a not at fault accident. That that's been dismissed. That's why I need to contact this other other department to make sure is that is that. Correct. Okay. Or not, but that's the only difference. Okay, so let me place you in a brief hole. Let me contact this other department. Okay. All right. Sounds great. You bet. Thanks. Okay. Thank you for waiting. Sorry for the long delay. Apologize. Okay. Jeremy, we just reviewed the policy with another department. They mentioned that the MBR, the DMB system was down when we create when we when we create this policy, and that's why the MBR report pulled another additional accident, and that's make the difference. And this two hundred six is valid. That's that's you asked me. That's not a foul, but that's also make a difference on the MBR on the premium. But this is the correct premium because the MBR the system was down. Okay, so can you on the dynamic drive? Did she ever enroll in that dynamic drive? I believe it is. I see the jet. It is it is discount. It is apply. So it is active. That is active. Correct. It is active. Yes. Okay, so even though there's a not at fault accident, there are no points on the policy. You are still charging the higher premium of two hundred and six dollars. Correct. Even though there's no points. At all. Zero points. That. Yes sir. That's hard to explain to a customer. How that is. I understand you just explained that the DMB system was down and the system did not pull the correct information. That's that's exactly what happens. Yeah, that's just it's kind of. I wish your system wouldn't allow a policy to be bound then if that was the case, but nonetheless that's not on you. All right, so the policy the next payment is showing one ninety four twenty nine. All right. Is that correct? Make sure I'm looking at this right. That's correct. And it's going to say twenty dollars more for the remainder of the year, basically. Okay. That's correct, sir. Alrighty, I will reach out and let her know. Yes sir. Thank you. Yes sir, thank you. Alright, have a great day. You too.
