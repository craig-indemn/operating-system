This is Jessica. Can I help you? Hi, guys, Jessica. Um, I was reaching out. This is Jessica. I was sorry. Um, I reached out to you through you know, like with Ben Ford or something. Um, I was calling because um, the Frank Winston insurance. Um, for some reason, like it canceled, but it was an auto pay. I don't know why it canceled. I actually received a notification on that a few minutes ago. Yeah, looks like it canceled for non payment. We can probably get it reinstated. But I think the payment must have not went through or something. Okay, because I um actually spoke with them, and they saw the card on file and everything and they like, I guess they ran it again. But um um, like I guess like most of see if it did go through or didn't go through they didn't tell me but they said that they were going to rerun it because I mean it's. The yellow nettle and everything, but I don't know like what happened. Um and they had just emailed me earlier this morning, so I don't know if they were able to do it or not or what happened. Okay, let me give them a call and I'll reach back out to you on that. Okay, that's fine. Um, while I have you on the phone too, or something else. Um. The audit with Amtrak's it looks like that was never finished so they're like I asked them to reopen it again to be proactive about it because I mean they would send like a good amount of money to collection that probably. Is it correct? It's just a non compliant um. Fee that Amtrak adds on there so the audit can be done, but if it's not done then it gets it the collection and I just don't want that affecting you guys as credit. Um, so I did ask for them to reopen it again. Uh, she emailed you and me um this morning. And it has like the portal link, and the password. I was going to try to take a look at it. I know I want to say you're one person I helped along like a few years ago on getting the audit done. Um, so if it's something like that, I could definitely try to help you. Um. But I I would definitely suggest for this to get done because you don't want twenty thousand dollars going to collection that you don't really even know. Yeah right. Okay, um, I did send it to them. Um, I think I they were having a I don't know they didn't they weren't able to receive it or something and then I sent it back to you. Um, but if if I can resend it here, I can look through the email and I'll resend it. Um, it's from the one that last year, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, let me look through my email again and I'll resend that here in a few minutes. Does not um if I can't find it, I get off at eight so it'll be till I get home or tomorrow. I don't know. I think we have until like the twenty four to provide all requested documents. Alright, I'll send that for sure though. Okay, thank you. Um, sorry. Um, I was going to ask you something else and I can't remember. Oh, that that's it. I'll once I remember, I'll just email you. Okay. Alright, thank you. Oh, thanks. Have a good day. Okay.
