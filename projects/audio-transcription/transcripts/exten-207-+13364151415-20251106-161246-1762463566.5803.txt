Sorry, hold. This is Cody to help you. Hey Cody, this is Lily. How are you? Hey Lily, I'm good. How are you? Well, good, good. I'm running into a little issue. I moved home, so all the mail. I didn't see it until. Yep, so I just got the mail like two weeks ago from the new owners. Yeah. And they I called them and they were going to give me another time frame. You know for me to. Collect all the paperwork that they need. Yes, but apparently they went ahead and charged. You know without getting even letting me finish. Oh, I. I blew up on travelers a minute ago because they've been doing this for policies that are active and on EFT. Yeah. The true policy obviously canceled back in July. Yeah. And because it was set up on EFT at the time. They apparently have permissions within their contractor. However, that's done. When the audit goes noncompliant, uncooperative, whatever, then they draft the uncooperative audit fee. Since it was on EFT when it was active. Yeah, I'm not too happy about that. You know, I like. And they will not refund it basically until you complete the audit and then. They will sort that out at that time based on the results of the audit. Okay. Do you have happen to have like an archive of my premiums still and everything? That way I know. Yeah, I mean I can get a range here. I just I had it up and still. If you could just email it to me. What are you needing to know? How much payroll you had on the policy? Or. Yes, I don't remember what what the actual amount was. Let's see. Yeah, if you just want to write this down. So the policy that we did just had a hundred thousand in payroll on it. Because you were the owner and so we just had basically like two employees with a hundred thousand in payroll is what's on the policy. Okay. Did um does it say my income as well? I don't remember how much I told you. Nothing income related when it comes to workers' comp. It's all payroll. It's just employees. Okay. It's just how many employees you have and what their total payroll is based on what they do. Yeah, obviously you just have one type of employee. So. Yeah, because here's the thing: I would pay them. I would pay them either like in cash or a business check directly that drops from the that you know that takes it off from the account. The records to show that and then you need to have. Typically, they want tax documents to show that as well. So like. Your 24 to 25, you know, 941 tax forms or whatever. Okay. Your taxes and that's what they always almost always want to see and usually they won't complete your audit until they have those tax documents to. It's basically just like you know official. Tax proof, tax document proof of you know the ledger or the. You know spreadsheet or whatever that you submit showing your payroll. Yeah. All righty, sounds good. I just wish you know they would they would apply all of that at the beginning like us proving to them at the beginning instead of having to go through it at the end. Oh believe me, I understand. Yeah, but when it comes to audits, it's a after the policy term ends. That's when they do the audit and that's how everything is always set up with workers' comp policy. Okay. All righty, Cody. Well, thank you anyways. You're welcome. I'm sorry about that. I. It burned me up pretty bad to be honest with you. I know. I mean, I was you know I was counting without money. One of my trust a big chunk of change just come out randomly four months after your. Yeah. But again, I guess with insurance and audits and stuff, that's why it's so important to make sure you know when a policy ends that you are you know communicating and responding to requests and stuff like that to get this stuff done. Yeah. Now this is the first time I have an audit right with with travelers. With travelers, yes. Because I've never had an insurance audit ever unless my account it probably would handle it. Yeah, so any workers' comp policy you have with any company is always going to have an audit every year. Gotcha. A general liability policy is up to the company whether or not they do it typically. Okay. But most most general liability policies probably aren't going to audit, but but it's definitely something that they can do and often they they often do that on the general liability too. But the workers' comp is always going to have an audit every year. It doesn't matter if it lasts the full year or if it lasts two months and
