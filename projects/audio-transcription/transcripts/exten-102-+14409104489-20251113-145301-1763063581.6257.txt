Sorry about the whole "this is Gloria" and "letting shine." Hi Gloria, my name is Christina. I'm calling from Progressive Insurance. I'm calling in regards to a mutual customer. I have that policy number. If that will be helpful. Okay. One. Okay. Okay. The policy number is nine seven seven. Three four six, nine six seven. And it's Shalom, Gia, Genomic Nursery. Correct. Okay, how about I. Yeah, so I had called about a week ago and requested that the agent reach out to the customer and give them my contact information. There was a claim submitted against their commercial policy. I have not been able to get in contact with them, so we're you know about to potentially deny this claim and take policy action. So I'm just calling back to see if the if anyone there was able to get in contact with the insured. Um, not yet, but I can give the insured a call right now and then let them know to get in touch with you. What's the good phone number to, for them to reach you. It is four four zero. Nine one zero. Four four. Eight nine. And then nine one zero four four eight nine. Do you have an extension? Yep. Yep, the that's my direct number, and then let me give you the claim number. It is. Two five, dash two six. Three nine. Eight zero two three one. Two three one. Okay, perfect. And your name is. Christina. That's with a K. Okay. And I'm with Progressive, so representing him. All right, thank you so much. I will reach out to the client. I'll try and make an effort to reach out to them and let them know that they should reach. Back to you. Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.
