Thanks for holding this, Gary. Hey, Gary. This is Eric McMahon. How are you? I'm doing well. How are you? Doing good, doing good. Over the weekend, my wife was doing. I've got my homeowners insurance with y'all. And over the weekend, my wife was doing a load of laundry, and the water started backing up at some point. During the rent cycle, and we had heard some gurgling in the back in the toilet that's down there too. In the basement, so I ended up doing research and it sounded like that was a back some sort of obstruction in the line. So I called. Who was it? Rotarouter to come out, and they scoped the line and they found some roots in the waistline underneath the house. And they told me that usually the replacement of the pipes is not covered by insurance, but because mine is in the concrete slab of the basement, that usually my insurance would cover accessing the plumbing in any repairs to the the water may have caused to the baseboards and sheet rock and that kind of stuff. And that sounds like a that sounds like a possibility to me. It really does. Hold on just a minute. Let me let me get your account pulled up here. Just bear with me just a second. Sure, man. Is this your address on Pendleton Drive? It is. Okay. And what what day did you notice it, Eric? Yesterday, the day before yesterday. So Saturday or Sunday? Sunday, Sunday. And then they weren't able to come out until yesterday. Sunday afternoon. Yeah. Okay. How much damage do you think you have? What was damaged? Some baseboard, maybe a little bit of sheet rock. It got underneath the floors in the exercise room, but that is that luxury vinyl plank. So that even damaged the floor itself. Okay. I don't know. I'm not good at judging that stuff, but. No finisher or anything like that. We just have to be able to give them some type of a description. So. Right. Yeah, I'd say some baseboard, some wall, maybe some maybe some flooring. But the biggest thing he said, I wouldn't even worry about that. The biggest thing he said is, it's the waistline that's in encased in the concrete slab of the basement, so that'll have to be jack hammered up. And he said usually insurance will cover accessing the plumbing, but not the replacement of the panel. So I think the most expensive thing would be, you know, getting to that damaged plumbing. I think probably what would need to do is just get it filed for you and then go from there. Yeah. This phone number for you: three three six three eight two eight one six three. Who is my insurance with anyway? It is with Liberty Mutual. Okay. Um. Actually, Safe Code Liberty Mutual, same thing. And we will get it filed for you, and they should be in touch with you probably probably be within a day or so. Okay. Okay. They have a. Email me, call me, or what? They can do it either way you want. Whichever way you want to do it. Let's do. Well, I mean, there's times at work I won't be able to answer the phone, but they can always email. But I, I can give them both. Let's both respond. I'll make sure they have both. And and of course if they call you and they can't get through, they'll leave a message for you. Okay. Okay. And would you once you file that claim? Will you send me a was it a claim number? We will, we will. Okay. That's awesome. What was your name again? Gary. Gary, I appreciate your help, boy. You're very welcome. Have a good one. You too. Bye bye.
