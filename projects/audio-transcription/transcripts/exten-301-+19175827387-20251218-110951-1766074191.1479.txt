Hey Robert, I think the call dropped. It did. I'm so sorry. On my phone has been acting up lately. So if it happens again, I will call you back again. Sadly, it's so irritating. I apologize. No worries at all. I am talking Jamie right now, so we can figure out what exactly is going on. Yeah, because like I remember and it even shows here on the December 1st. My bill came through for 79701, which is accurate. That's that's the first half that's due, but then it also shows the bank return of 1671. Which shouldn't apply to this account. That should have applied to the homeowner's account. So now it shows that I'm in a deficit of the combo. Okay. Okay, Jamie is also pulling up, so hopefully we can figure this out. You said that the bill you got for the auto was for 2468. No, the bill the original bill is 79701, which was what the original quote was for the half for the year for the half year, which just makes sense. But now when I log on to the account to make a payment, it shows that it's 2468 in total. To renew. Like even if if it was double the 797, like that would only be 1600 for the full year. So the 246 is like even more than than that. Yeah, yeah. So it's showing me that the 2468 is your renewal premium. Did you receive a renewal quote for December 2nd, 25 to December 2nd, 26? Yes, 79701. That's what Jamie and I talked about. Okay, and that and that was for the whole year or for six months. That is from 1225 to 1226. Is the bill. Okay. Like I can send you the bill. Like I have your screenshot of it for help. Yeah, if you want to text it over just so we can look at it because that sounds like it's an error in traveler system. I can give you a number to text it to. Someone's calling. Is Jamie calling me maybe? Probably he said that he's going to try to call you. Should I answer it? Yeah, go ahead. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Fine.
