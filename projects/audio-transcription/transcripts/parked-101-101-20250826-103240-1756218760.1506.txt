Thank you for patiently holding. This is Monty speaking. How can I help you? Hi, Monty. Um, my name is Colin. I'm with information providers. I'm conducting a workers compensation audit for one of your clients. Okay. That's first you know. I'm a de church. Yep, that's correct. Okay. Yeah. And um, I've been in touch with Julie Hill and she has um received the work she used to be completed for the audit and the last time I checked in with her she said that she received all of the payroll information from their accounting firm and that their church treasurer had um is still working on the rest of the info. Um, it's just that the audit is getting a little bit older so we do need that info as soon as possible. So I was just wondering if you could reach out to either of them and just give them a nudge to complete and submit everything as soon as possible, please. Yeah, sure. I can definitely reach out to them and you know just kind of let them know that we kind of need to get that taken care of. So. Okay, that sounds great to me. And Julie has all my contact info. So if she has any questions, any questions, she can just reach out to me either by phone or by email. All right. What was your name one more time? Uh, Colin. Colin. All right. All right, man. I will give them a call and let them know. Awesome. Thank you so much for your help, Monty. No problem. Yeah, good day. Bye. You too as well. Thank you.
