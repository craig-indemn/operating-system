Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, I need to get some information. I canceled, policy. I mean, I canceled some auto insurance about six eight weeks ago. And they said I was supposed to get a refund on my account, and I never have received it. And I was wondering if there's anything you could tell me about it. Okay, was it where you removed a vehicle or canceled a policy? I canceled. I took out. It was a ninety five Ranger and I put license on it and. I went ahead and put full insurance on it and I canceled it about two three months later. And said that I should get the rest of it back a refund from the company, but I hadn't received it yet. I don't know if I'd been mailed, made it miss up or what. Yeah, well, give me one moment and I will get an agent that can help. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome.
