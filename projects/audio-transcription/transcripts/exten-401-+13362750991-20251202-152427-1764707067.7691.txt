Hi Heather, this is Taryn Turner at Penney. Oh hey Taryn. I'm good, girl. How are you? I am good. I was actually out last week and yesterday. Nice. It was you know kind of unexpected. So. Oh no. Not not not really a good thing. I'm fine, but my husband my husband had. Something had to go into the hospital, so. Oh no. Much better. Yeah. Oh good good. So we were in the hospital. Oh god. I know. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Everything's okay. He just had a mild heart attack and. Pretty scary. Yeah. I know it was. Gosh and I hate that for you. But I am so glad I was I was holding my breath. I was like, "Please don't tell me somebody died." Like oh my gosh. I know. So praise the Lord. I was working at home Monday, and my neighbor came in and was yelling for me. And I'm like, "What's my neighbor calling me inside my house?" You know. Oh god. And he had collapsed outside. Oh god. Yeah, but thankfully I was here because normally I'm in the office on Mondays and Tuesdays. But it was Thanksgiving week, so my manager said, "Oh, you guys work at home. It'll be fine. You can work from home." Nice. So thankfully I was like, "Thank you, Lord. I was here." Oh nice. And everything is okay. It's okay. He didn't. Great. Can't put in so no surgery. Well that's good. It could be a lot worse. You know. Oh my goodness. Shared me girl. But I know you're swamped and I got your you sent an email late last night and I and I had a chance. But Tanya had your voicemail and texted me. I said, "I'll call her." I got. Oh yeah, I just called her. I yeah. It's fine. Karen, I swear. Blacklock. It is for Tommy. Yeah, Tommy Blacklock. I want to say Blaylock, but it's Blacklock. So the claim on her is from a prior residence. Does that go count? It was a new claim on her. Does it? It does. Now, so this was on the prior home. So what year is the roof on this new home? Twenty sixteen. Okay. She she's lived here for two years, I believe. Oh okay. I think she yeah I think she purchased this home in 2003. I can't remember to the best of my knowledge. It was like I think she had it on it for two years. Now on the auto, the auto quote was okay and qualifies and you're good to go with that. So it would be both home and auto, right? Well, I need an umbrella too. Okay. I haven't got there yet. I just stopped. I was like, "Yes, I was working late last night, but I was like, I got to quit. I my eyes were going. I mean, I was sitting up at ten o'clock at home last night." Oh my god. I mean, which I took off you know Thursday and Friday. So you know. Oh good. Good. Pay for it now. I know that's so true, but you still. You still need some time. You got to take some time away. Yeah and I mean I use my computer home every weekend and just about every night. And sometimes I open it back up or sometimes I don't but I my intention because they did let us leave at two thirty on Wednesday. And so I shut my computer down and put my little laptop with me and I was like, oh you know I'll be working some Friday or over the weekend over the long holiday and I didn't even crack it open Karen so. You need that time. Where I'm at right now. So let me see. Blacklock, let me find her auto quote. It's just I think it's her and her daughter. I just want to look over the auto to make sure. And I need to. If y'all do an umbrella, I write the umbrella. What's the limit? Listen. I think I quoted it one hundred three hundred, but like I said, I wasn't. Sure, we could even get this, and I'll say. Yeah, looks like you quoted it two fifty five hundred. That's. Oh I did bump it up. Okay. Okay. So that's good. Like I can't remember Karen. Yeah I understand. I'm looking through. Let's see. So she's sixty one. Daughter seventeen. And I I don't know if it's I don't know the situation. I'm assuming that she might be a grandmother but like the. Could be granddaughter right. Yeah
