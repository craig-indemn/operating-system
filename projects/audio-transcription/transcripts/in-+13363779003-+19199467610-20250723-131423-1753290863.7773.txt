Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hi, this is Jasmine calling. Called yesterday in regards to my commercial auto policy. I'm trying to find out if there was a lapse in coverage. I spoke with Gloria yesterday. She said she was going to call me back to let me know, but I still haven't gotten a call back. Do you know she's available right now? I can check for you. Just one moment. Thank you. You're welcome.
