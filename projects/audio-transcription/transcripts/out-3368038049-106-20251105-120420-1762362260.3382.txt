Hello. Hello, my name is Jessica with Alliance Insurance. Is this MJ? Yeah, hi Jessica. Hi, how are you? I'm doing good. Thank you. I had a voicemail that you called. I think you had some questions. Yeah, so I'm in the process of selling my contract and trying to kind of switch from the you know automatic with the after to going to glider with manual. So I've been told like meanwhile while I sell my truck, to keep the authority I can. They told me like put a commercial insurance on a personal car. Is that true? I'm sorry. I'm. Do you have insurance with us or? I know. I do have. What's that? Progressive. With progressives. Yeah, it's with Progressive. I got auto one million liability. So my question is that if I sell my truck while looking for a new truck. What's what's the situation? I checked with friend of mine. He told me like check with the insurance, with an agent. They can like when I sell the truck they can switch it to a commercial like auto liability on a small like personal car. No, you would just if you're gonna sell the truck that you have now and then buy another one in the next week or two. You would leave everything as is until you have the new truck because you can't take it off and leave nothing on the policy because that's it'll cancel you have to cancel it. You cannot also add on some policies. Policies you can't add a personal auto policy. It doesn't transfer over to a personal auto policy. You have to cancel it and get a new policy if you're gonna get a smaller car that you're not gonna use for your business. Okay, so how about if it takes more than one or two weeks to get a new truck? It just depends on how long you're okay with paying. With the with the truck that you had previously, like if it's gonna be a month, then you're okay with keeping that policy active for a month. You can do that, but if it's gonna be more than that and you just want to cancel it and start a new one whenever you have the truck, you can also do that. No, but the problem is I cancel it then the authority is gonna right. Yeah, yeah, I would cancel. It would cancel. Okay. Okay, appreciate it. Thank you so much, Jessica. I'm glad you're done.
