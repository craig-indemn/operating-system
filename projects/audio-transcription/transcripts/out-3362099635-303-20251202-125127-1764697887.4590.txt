Hello. I speak to Geo, please. Yes, Geo. Hey, Geo. This is Mark with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Good. I was giving you a call. I wanted to let you know that we're still working with your carrier for your auto policy to try to get the three points removed off the policy. Their procedure is until the policy is closed or the claim is closed out. They'll charge the points if it determines that it's not your fault. It was the other carrier's responsibility. Then they'll reimburse you those three points. But we're working on it just with the holidays and then everything else. It's taking a little bit time to get claims to to get everything finalized and closed out. So we'll continue to work on it. We just wanted to give you an update so you wouldn't think we had forgot about you. Okay, but we didn't claim anything. We just reported to y'all just because of our insurance. We claim you have paid us not one dollar. I understand that. I totally understand that and and we're you know we're we're talking to the to the carrier and explaining that it's just their procedure the way they handle things when there's an open claim. And so we're working with them and seeing what we can get done. Okay. And we'll continue to do that. We just didn't want you think we'd forgot about you and and you know if everything settles out. It seems like it was the other person's fault. Is that correct? Yes. Do you have any? Have they closed the claim out? No, just the car. They done the car. They paid the car off. But you still got. You still got your medical. It's a long drawn out thing because he was in a hospital. He had major surgery. Oh. So it was a bad, very bad wreck. Is he doing fault? Doing. Is he doing better now? Yes, he's back in school and. Well, good. Well, good. Well, good. Well, we want. We'll you know if you know if anything gets closed out and you haven't heard from us get with us. But we're we're going to see what we can do and see what can happen. Okay. Okay, and he's also going to have his license for two years. One day in December, I'm not sure which one. Okay. Okay. Usually, what'll happen at that is once they've hit the two year mark, it'll it'll give it a change a change the the rating a little bit. Okay. And all right, all right. I just didn't want you think we'd forgot about you because I know I would be I would be wanting somebody to let me know what's going on. So I'll follow up with you as soon as I can and I'm going to actually reach out to one of our representatives with that carrier and see what we can get done. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye bye.
