This is Jessica. How can I help you? Hi Jessica. This is Andrew with Franklin Stink Chrome. Let's give me your call in regards to this workers' comp policy I have here. It's under Senator Nolasco Rosano. It's just in regards to their auto pay for the renewal. Okay, go ahead. Um. Yes, so they did for their renewal. They were removed from the previous billing account and put on single bills like their own account. Um. So we are needing that auto pay information to get that set up so that they're good to go for August installment. Okay, give me one moment because I thought we had done that already. Give me one moment. I know we got his new information. I'm just not able to locate it. Yeah, I'm not. Um. And so why? So why did it come off of auto pay again? Sorry. So went from a like account level bill to its like own. So it was removed from the billing account that it was previously on. And it went to single bill. So when that change happened, unfortunately, auto pay information does not transfer over from that previous billing account. So we don't have any auto pay information for them at the moment. Gotcha. And then when it is saved here on the system, it's we only see the last four. Like there's no ability to just transfer the information over. Once it's inputed. When did his renewal again? So it did renew already. Yeah, renewed as of six twenty. We collected the renewal down payment and the first installment, but this will just take effect then for August. Did we make a payment like manually? Yeah. The payment's been made manually. When when was that? What date was that? So this one was made July twenty first. July twenty July twenty first. So just a few days ago. I just I feel like he just gave us his information, but I'm just not locating it. And if we made a payment for him, then I feel like we should have it. Um. But maybe not. So let me I guess reach out to him to get that again. Because I guess it's not saved on your end. Um. Sometimes I know we could go. In and it'll say that. That it's saved and then let me try to see that way. Does it show you what paint what payment method the the last payment was dropped from? Yeah. I want to see. Right, it's an ACH ending in sixty three sixty one. Okay. Can we not just use that information like for auto pay? Yes, so it's on the previous billing account, but I'm not able to transfer that information. Because the only thing I see here is the last four of the account number. Once it's inputed in the system, all we see is the last four of the account number. And it doesn't let me transfer the payment information. Gotcha. Okay. Um. Okay. Let me. See if I can find find information or reach out to him to get it again. And then um we'll call back to set it up on auto pay. Okay. All right. No problem. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
