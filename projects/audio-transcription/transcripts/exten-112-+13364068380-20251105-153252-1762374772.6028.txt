Hello. Hey Antonio. Yes, that's me. Um, okay, so I wanted to give you a heads up. The mortgage company has everything that they need, and this quote for your for this home is. Um. Fourteen. Hold on, let me pull it back up. It's fourteen twenty for the year. So it's cheaper. Fourteen twenty. Yes. Well, they they figured out less before because the house is new. This is with auto owners so that you can still keep the discount on your auto. Okay. What? You got two hundred two hundred and eight thousand six hundred um coverage for the home to rebuild if something happens, and this is a hundred percent replacement cost. And you've got all the coverages that you had before on your current home, but this is a lot cheaper than the home that you. I mean, the home that you have now. Okay, that's good. Okay, so I send everything over to them. So the next thing is just issuing the policy as we get closer to the closing date, and then having the mortgage pay us. Whenever you close. Okay, that's fine. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Let me know if they need anything else. Okay. Okay, I agree. Thank you. Bye bye. You're welcome. Bye.
