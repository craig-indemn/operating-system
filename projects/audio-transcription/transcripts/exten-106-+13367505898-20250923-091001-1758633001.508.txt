This is Jessica. How can I help you? Hey Jessica, this is Maggie. Hey Maggie. I'm good. How are you? Um, I, I had a question. Um, what was I gonna ask you? Oh, you think you could try to get us a quote for the umbrella? I know you say it might take a few days, I mean a week maybe, but at least you'll get one. Because um the other agent I don't know if he's still taking mom. So what what was he doing with that? Um, if he was trying to quote us for the three million, remember and we have like one million I think. You were trying to get the three million the one that the company was asking us for. Gotcha. Okay. Um. Yeah, I can try to start that. Let me see. Okay. Let me see. Uh, did oh, did they send over the certificate yet for the? I mean, what was it? Uh, the business auto. They were waiting for that roof, please. Yeah, I've been to that because we just wanted for it to say that that they were gonna get a notification once it will cancel or something like that. Oh okay, gotcha. Yeah. And I had I had been done that, but I think they I sent it to another lady and she didn't send it to them. I guess. Okay, girl. Let me start on the umbrella. I'm gonna go ahead and reach out to the company and see what they need from me to get that started. Okay. Um. Also, um, for the auto insurance. Um, for the other one, the personal one. I think I remember you gave me a quote on it. Oh, uh huh, yeah yeah. Um, you think it will be um a little bit less if I put my mom first? Um. Well, let me see. It depends honestly. Um, if Miguel is still on there, probably it'll be about the same. If her credit is better than Miguel's, then maybe it'll be a little cheaper. But no, it probably would be about the same. Um. If Miguel wasn't a driver completely on that, then yeah, then it probably would be a lot cheaper. Okay. Okay, but you think it's still gonna be like at least a little bit cheaper. I can try. It doesn't hurt to try. It doesn't take too long either. Okay. Um. Could you just um, try to get a quote for both? If you can. Yeah. Okay. That's fine. You just give me a call like this. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Bye.
