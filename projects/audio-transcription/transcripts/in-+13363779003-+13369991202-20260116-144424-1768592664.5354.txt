Well, like I said, I paid in November and I wasn't supposed to pay on my policy until December December the second, which I don't get paid a third of every month anyway. So I paid in November when I got it and I paid in December and I paid this one. So it should be it's showing eight hundred or nine hundred some dollars. Should be down lower than that. Okay, so um, so before we applied your payment, the balance was nine hundred and twenty three dollars and twenty one cents. Yes, ma'am. So after this processes, it'll be eight hundred and twenty three dollars and twenty one cents. But what I'm getting at though, ma'am, I was in November when they sent me the policy. I paid on I paid on it in November of a hundred and I think one hundred and forty dollars. Then I paid in December, so I shouldn't have a payment until January. But I went, you know. Yeah, your payment wasn't actually due until January the twenty sixth for forty nine dollars and twenty two cents. Yeah, because you're not getting. I'm saying though, when I when the policy got to me, I you know I wasn't supposed to pay on the policy until December December the second of twenty twenty five or. You know last year, that's when my policy. Renews every year, so I went ahead and when they turned it to me in November, I paid one hundred forty dollars, which I shouldn't have paid in December, which I went ahead and done anyway. Now paid in June, then I'm paying today. Okay, yeah, you. It looks like you are paying ahead, Stephen. So what I can do is, I'm going to print out where it shows what your future
