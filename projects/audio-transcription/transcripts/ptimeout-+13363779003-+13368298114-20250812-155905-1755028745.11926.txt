Okay, Tommy. I think that you had. I'm I'm assuming I sent Amanda a message to see if you were talking to her, but. I've got some notes in here because I was the one who helped set your policy up. Right. Right. And I know that you had said something about a document that you couldn't open or something, and and that at that time that we had talked. I had sent JC a message and I think she was the one who actually reviewed the policy with you. She said that she didn't send you anything and that she doesn't need you to sign anything. Okay, well that's that's fine because I I don't know what I got three or four different emails. Said do you sign so I or electronic sign whichever it was but I I've never had to do that before but I didn't know. Yeah I think you're fine. Because I got a note in here and she messaged me back on what day was it. On August the sixth, and I said, "Did you send him a document to sign? He couldn't open it. " And you said something about coming by the office to sign it. And then she said, "No, I didn't ever send him anything. We don't need anything signed. " Okay, I guess whoever I talked to last week sent it to me. I guess I don't know who. Not not J not not JC but. Whoever that girl was that I talked to after that when JC didn't answer the phone or she wasn't in or something I don't I don't remember now. Okay. Well. Because she she took all my information when I call back she took all my information my routing number. Okay. That was me. So I don't need you to sign anything. Okay. I do have a note in here to wait for your. I think I'm waiting for your motorcycle to draft and then I'll go back in and then set it up on the. The routing and account number. Okay, that's cool. All right, then. But I think we're good, Tommy. All right, just double checking. Okay, very good. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Bye bye. All right, bye bye.
