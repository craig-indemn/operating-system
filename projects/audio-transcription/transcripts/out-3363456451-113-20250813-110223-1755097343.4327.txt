Hello. Hey, Mr. Limeberry, it's Gary at Alliance Insurance. Hello. How are you? I'm good. Hope you are. I am. I've got some rates for you here on that package policy for the auto home and umbrella. Yes. Do you want to write this down or would you want me to email it to you? Let me write it down. I was just going in here to get something to write on. Okay. Okay. Go ahead. Now these numbers I'm giving you there for 12 months. Okay. I think maybe your your state farm auto policy was for six months. Yes. The auto insurance came back at 170195 and that's for the year. Okay. And the home came back at 1394. Okay. And the umbrella came back at 248 dollars a year and that's the excess coverage that is gives you an additional million dollars for your liability. Okay. And the only thing that we have yet to do if if you're interested or or think you might move forward is we did not run the driver there then those numbers for that could change. Okay. All right. Well. I'll just I can make a note here and you can study on it a bit and um and then whenever you get ready to maybe make a move on it then you can let us know or if there's any changes we need or whatever but now I can send you physical copies of these quotes to your email if you want me to do that. That'd be fine if you do that too. I will do that and that will outline everything for you. Okay. And and then that way you can look at it line for line and make sure we got everything correct. Okay. Well I sure do appreciate this. It is no worry whatsoever. And do you have our number? Yes, I sure do. Okay, great. Then I hope to talk to you soon. All right. Well, thank you so much. Thank you. Bye bye.
