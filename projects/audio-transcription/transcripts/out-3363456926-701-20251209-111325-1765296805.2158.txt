Hello. Hey, Sandra. It's Jeremy at Alliance Insurance. Uh huh. How are you? I'm good. I hope you are. I am. Good, good. So I got Brittany's email yesterday evening there, and. Just a few more things I need to check on with you. Okay. So in regards to. The home there, what year? Excuse me. Let me back up just a second. Do you have a swimming pool? No. Okay. Trampoline. No. Okay. And in regards to the home just in general, there. When. Have you done any updates to the home or anything of that nature recently? No. All right. Good deal. And. On your homeowner's deductible currently, it looks like and I know you said this was an older one that you had in place. But that you had just a thousand dollar deductible. That's something you would like to keep there or would you want to look at it to be higher where your premium could lower? What what works for you guys. Our deductible we want to keep the same thing on the house the thousand dollars. Keep it the same. Okay. All right, good deal. We can do that. And. The roof year, what is that? Roof year at what you think? What year it was last replaced? Oh god, it's been at least twenty years. Okay. Got it. Um, do you have a monitored alarm system by any chance? We have smoke alarms. Okay. There's one in every room. Excellent. Good deal. Good deal. And do we have any dogs? I've got one. Okay. What kind of fur baby do we have? Chihuahua. That's right. Yep. Okay, let's check this deductible. And there's no mortgage on the house. Correct. No. Good for you. Good for you. And. I always feel like there's one question I always forget to ask and I don't know why that is. Um. Craziest thing. So let's see what else we've got. Make sure I've got everything that I need right here. Do you have breaker boxes or done any electrical? Yes. Okay. We have breaker boxes. We haven't done any electrical. Okay. All right. And HVAC, you know you're heating and air. Yes. Okay. What about it? When when was that last updated? We haven't done anything to it. It's still working good. We use all heat. All right. Good deal. Do you have a heat pump on the water then or do you do something different there? No. We just have regular. We have well water. Okay. All right. Okay. Now. I'm setting this up for. A quote to look for more toys of renewal when you guys are set to renew for. Your home. I think your auto's January 17th. What it looks like a little bit. Some more around there. Yes, ma'am. Um. And have you guys had any homeowners claims? No. Okay. And on your auto. No. Okay. Good deal. And I did see your little note there on the email that you want to make sure that basically you got comprehensive. Is what I'm seeing on the cars. That'll be for quote unquote fire and deer there if you will. Yes. Um. And I'm just showing the three vehicles. Correct. The O4 Nissan 91 Chevy and the 13 Explorer. Yes. Okay. And they are all paid for. Excellent. Good deal. And I see the frequency that. Um. You drive is set for the pleasure rating. So yeah, we the only thing we drive is just to go to the doctor and to the grocery store. Other than that, we stay at home. Are retired? Okay. Perfect. Yep. All right. So now what we'll do is. I'll work and we'll start pumping this information into the. Indoor system here. Seeing what we can find out with our. Different carriers in that as well. So what you can expect is. Um. Hopefully by closing business tomorrow to maybe have you some ideas on some figures and different things like that. Do you pay monthly? Do you pay upfront for the year? How do you normally pay for your? We'd like to do it monthly. Way our budget runs, we'd like to do monthly if possible. Okay. All right. Perfect. Excellent. That's everything I think I needed unless you've got any questions for me. Go ahead. I got a couple of questions for you. I told my daughter the other day about you and she wanted to know what your last name was. My last name. Uh huh. Is Palmer. Okay. I was telling her that I told you know she you live the way she does and she was wondering who's in the fire department. Oh, that I know up there is Ronnie. Key. Ronnie Key.
