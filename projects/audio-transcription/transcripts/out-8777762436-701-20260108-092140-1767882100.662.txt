This is the third day on this one. So we've gotten everything cleared up on documentation that was required for the insured. And he paid in full at the beginning, and somehow there's an eighty three dollars balance that is still showing that they indicated initially was from the documentation not being provided to them. And I needed to call back today to see if we could go ahead and get that eighty three dollars taken off now that everything has been satisfied. There was new here. I'm going to place you on hold and I'll be back. All right, no problem at all. Thanks. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much for holding. I appreciate that. So. I see it was updated for proof of prior, but I don't see that it was updated for multi product. Multi product. Correct. So there was two discounts that was being given. There was a multi product discount and then there was a proof of prior discount. Since there is not a multi product like a business owner's policy or a GL policy, that eighty three dollars is. The discount that was being given for that, then that's been added back into the policy. Oh, okay. So he's got a general liability, but it's not with Progressive. Is that why the or do you have to see a copy of that policy even though it's not with Progressive to give him that credit? He would need to see. That he would need to yes it would need to be provided. Okay, so I just need to get a copy of his declaration pages for his general liability policy. And get that sent to where exactly?
