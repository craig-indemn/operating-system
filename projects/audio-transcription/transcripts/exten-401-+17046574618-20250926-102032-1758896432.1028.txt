Hello, this is Heather. Hey, this is Kenneth Holston. You'd called me back a while ago. Yes, sir. Hey, yeah, I got your voicemail. Um, so you're inquiring about an estate. It sounds like. Well, what it is? My dad passed away in May, and he had his homeowners paid up through September, which was through State Farm, which is where I have all of my insurance as well. And it ran out yesterday, and they won't renew it because they said they won't renew a policy on. Said they won't renew a policy that that's like in the in a state where my nephew lives there, but they said they wouldn't do it until we could show him a deed to where it was deeded into somebody's name. And I'm just in the process of getting everything ready to sell it, and I'm just letting him live there because he lived with my dad. So I'm letting him live there until I sell it so it's not empty. And I called Progressive and they don't do it, and they said that it looked like y'all did it. So Progressive gave me your phone number. Right, yeah, they they do that. They they record, but y'all um unfortunately I don't. I don't have one either. I and you're you're putting it up for sale once you get all the paperwork. The legal stuff taken care of. Is that right? Yeah, I'm just in the process of taking care of everything. I'm the executor and I'm just trying to figure out how to keep insurance on it in case you know you never know. You sell it. Yes, yeah. Right. So I would recommend going just since it's going to be short term like that. Call an NCJUA. It's North Carolina Joint Underwriters. Yeah. Yeah, they'll do it. Say NCJ. Do you say NCJUA? Yeah, that's the initials. It's you can Google. It's North Carolina Joint Underwriters Association. So they they'll write it. I'm trying to. I was trying to put a no in and every time I put them initials in it auto cracks into something else. Oh yeah, love it right. Um. But yeah, it's North Carolina. What? Joint Underwriters Association. Okay. All right. Yeah, and like I said, they'll they um. They'll write it. I think the only thing that they don't write is the liability. That you know someone comes on the property and gets hurt. Nothing that can be covered, but it's for it's just like a fire policy. Um. Yeah, that's all really. I want some kind of fire or hurricane or you know something just something. Damage insurance. So they can do that. Yeah, they just don't like the liability. So yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. I don't need that part. Yeah. All right. Thank you. You're welcome, then. Let me know if you need anything else. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Take care. Bye bye.
