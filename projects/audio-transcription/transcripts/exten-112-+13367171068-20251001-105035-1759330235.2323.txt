Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Brandi, this is Michelle Buffalo. You said you had enough quote for insurance. Yes. Getting pulled up right now. Bear with me. Now is Ronald's driver's license still suspended? No, I think he got it back. Okay. I have to ask him today. Okay. Yeah, just ask him. Okay. That may change the price just a little bit because he'll be rated a little bit differently. And I can't say for sure whether it'll be up or down. Okay. But it's still showing as suspended right now because we don't have an updated one. Okay. But if we switch you to National General. Um. Now you'll still have an outstanding balance with Progressive. Um. But if I put you with National General, if it'll load. All right. So the down payment will be one thirty two sixty eight and then payments monthly will be around one hundred nine. And this is with the same exact coverage that you had with Progressive. And it is a year long policy as well. Okay, so it. So to get it started would be one thirty two. Yes, one thirty two sixty eight. And if you wanted to do auto pay. And then I owe check in account. Um. The price would be lower. I'm so confused right now. One thirty. I'll say one thirty three. Right. And then um, I owe Progressive ninety nine. Yes. Uh, let me double check on that. That sounds right though. Okay, so yes, you it's ninety nine dollars and twenty five cents that you'll still owe Progressive. Okay. And um, if his license is suspended, how much that going to cost me? Well, it's on there right now as suspended. So. Okay. But if he's got an updated license. Um. Right. Let's see. I'm trying to see if I can change it. It wouldn't change it. It stays the same price. Okay. Okay. Oh. Can I get. Then to go on the one thirty three and then ninety nine. Um with a credit card. Yes. Yeah, we can do that. Now do you want to set the policy up on auto pay. Using a card or do you want to do your routing and check in account? Well, right now I don't put no money in the bank. Yeah. I'm talking about like monthly. Like today you can pay with a card to get it started. But I'll need something to put in here. To set it up on auto pay for next month. What is the auto pay date? It's whatever day you want it to be. Okay, so if I want the fourth of the month, I could do that. Yes. Because I get paid on. The third of every month. Yes, so you can do the fourth of every month. Now the fourth ever falls on a weekend. Then um. It'll come out the following Monday. Okay. But the initial one I'm gonna pay on credit card right. Right. Okay. So. I'm sorry for October. Will it be paid or do I need another? One hundred and thirty three on October fourth. No, so October will be paid for today. You won't have another payment until November fourth. Okay. And your payments so the first payment always costs a little bit more. So you're paying a hundred. Well, the the down payment is one thirty two and six cents. Then going forward monthly it's one hundred and eight. Okay. All right. Did you want to round up and do one thirty three today? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and then I got to do that ninety nine for Progressive. Okay. All right, and. What's that card number? Four four four seven. Nine six two eight. One three six five. Five nine eight six. All right, and expiration date. Nine twenty eight. And the code on the back. Eight sixty. Eight six zero. Yes. Okay. And the billing zip code. Two seven one zero six. All right. And what is your routing and check in account number? That way I can go ahead and set that up on auto pay for it to come out on the fourth of every month. Okay. The routing number is zero five four. Zero zero zero four zero. Three zero. Okay. And then the check in number is five three two eight. One four four two one one. All right. So you're gonna receive um. A email for the application for you to click and sign. That's going to come from National General. Okay. Um. The other thing that you're gonna receive is an email from me, and that'll have your new policy information documents in there. They will come in the mail as well, but I wanted to make sure you had it on hand. And then I will also attach in that same email that I send you the receipt
