I think they're holding this, Gary. Hi, I am here with one of your customers, Christopher Bryant, and he is doing an auto loan. So we're needing to add our lien to the vehicle as well as get proof of insurance. Okay, has he already added the car? Is it already on there or do you know? Yeah, he already has that vehicle on the policy. Okay, what is the lien address or the lien information? It's State Employees Credit Union. And our PO box is PO box two seven five two eight, Raleigh, North Carolina, and that is coded two seven six one one. Seven six one one. And where do you want me to send that to? And if you could email it to us, that that would be fine. I can give you our branch email just because my name's a little hard to spell. Okay. It's Mount M O U N T A R Y Branch or sorry, it's not branch, it's just Mount Ary at n c s e c u dot org. N C. Yeah, N C like North Carolina. S E as in State Employees. C C U. C U as Credit Union.
