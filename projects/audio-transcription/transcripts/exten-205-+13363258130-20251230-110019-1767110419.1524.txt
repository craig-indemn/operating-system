Like copies you on it. Okay, got you Sam. Hey man. Hey man. Uh sorry I didn't mean to bother you there I was going to try to figure out so are you g seeing this or you buying the land? We are we are buying the land hiring a grading contractor to do the rough grading put in the roads and then we will turn it over to Bojangles and Taco Bell to build the buildings. So we're ground lease. You you you're you're going to own the land. Yes. Okay. And then you're going to lease so they can put their own buildings on there. Yeah they pay to build their own buildings and they'll have builders' risk and things like that during their process we just need to have some general liability coverage with a legacy listed as our lender. Okay. All right. So you're going to own the land, build some roads. I know they're going to ask and I'm looking at this lot. I mean are you just going to put a parking lot in? I mean you're not really building roads are you? Yeah we're building a we're creating two frontage lots that have a I'll send you a site plan. Okay. Yeah we will we will rough grade the whole parcel and then build a spine road in between our parcel one and two and Taco Bell will go on the smaller lot right beside a Circle K and Bojangles will go on the corner at Barney Venable Road. Okay. What I'm looking at now, there appears to be a retention pond in the corner lot of that Circle K. Yeah. Okay so you're right beside it you're going to have. Correct and and we we won't have a retention pond because you don't have to have one Circle K didn't have to build one I don't know why they did but yeah all we're doing is we'll clear the trees rough grade it and build the road that's all we'll be doing. Just an shed or something on there. Is an old old house. Okay you're going to tear it down. Yep that'll be tore down as part of my grading contractor. Okay. All right. Okay all right. You got to get me started. When do you think you're going to close on it realistically? Right now we're tentatively scheduled to close January 9th but but Bojangles is getting a DOT made me add a detailed lane and a right turn island right in right out island so now Bojangles is having to redo their site plan to make sure that they feel good about trucks getting in I won't close until I get their affirmation and approval of the site plan. So the earliest is the ninth but most likely a little bit later than that it sounds like. I would say that that it's more than likely we will get everything resolved and close on the night but I have under contract I have till the end of the month. Okay. All right, all right we'll see if we can get some and I'm taking it you created a new LLC SRV Ford's last pilot mountain LLC. That's correct and you're the only person on it or you and me me and Samuel or fifty fifty. You and Samuel okay. Yep all right fifty fifty. This is the one he talked to you a little bit about on the equity side. Oh okay is that still there or is this done or? No it's still we still need to resolve that I mean we can close without having that in place but but actually he texted me today said hey I need talk to you I need talk Stan yeah he's got you on his list he just ain't done it yet. All right if y'all want to give a little whatever we just let me know. Okay because it's good timing for me I just got out of selling one down in Winston so right got some cash right now. Right okay. All right anything else I'll reach back out but that should get me going right there. It sounds good I'll shoot you an email with site plan on it. Thank you. Yep thanks buddy. Alright.
