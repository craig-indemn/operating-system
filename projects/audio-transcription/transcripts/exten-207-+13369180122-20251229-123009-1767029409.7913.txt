Hey man, I was calling on both. How are you? All right. Did you get my voice mail? I did. I did. I did. Yeah, they just light out. Don't accept cards. Which a lot of companies these days if they still take cards, they start charging these fees because they get charged fees for them. So they just want checking account stuff only unfortunately. Gotcha. I know you like to use your credit card. You said just pay it off, but unfortunately that won't work within this situation. I'd be all right. What bank do you use? Wood Forest. Wood Forest. What's the routing number? Uh zero five three one one one or excuse me zero five three one one two five nine two. Zero five three one one two five nine two. Correct. Okay, and the account number. One eight five seven four two zero six one four. One eight five seven four two zero six one four. Correct. All right. We'll get them issued and send over the ID cards and receipts and everything. It'll be set up on monthly auto draft. From the checking account, and you'll be good to go. We're going to issue it effective today and set up tomorrow is what you wanted right. Yes, correct. Because yeah, because mine I guess policy renews on Wednesday. Tomorrow, you know your other policy is the thirtieth, wasn't it? Thirty first. Yeah, they hit my checking account at the on the end of the month. I got you. That's why I was just just looking at my progressive account right now and says. Next payment scheduled for next scheduled for twelve thirty one. Okay, all right. So we'll issue these effective today, which means you can go ahead and call them and just cancel your other one. You know, you normally just cancel on that thirty first renewal date. Okay, well I'll probably just go ahead and cancel it tomorrow because it'll hit my account freaking midnight thing on the thirty first. Okay. Yeah, however you want to handle with them is fine. Yeah, I'll just I'll call them tomorrow that way they don't freaking. We should have these issued here in the next hour or two. I mean you can technically go ahead and just call them right now and just cancel it effective today if you want to do it that way. Okay. Because you won't have like any sort of laps or anything as long as you cancel it today, we'll have these started today. If anything comes up with the DMV, we can always just do this FS one forms I was telling you about. Hopefully you won't have to deal with that, but sometimes it just happens. Cool. Not sounds good. All right, buddy. I appreciate that. Sorry about the card and checking account situation. I know you want to. It'll be all right. All right, brother. I'll get it done for you. All right, appreciate man. Yes, sir. All right.
