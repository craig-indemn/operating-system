Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Hey Brandy, how are you? Good. How are you? Good. I got a question for you. Yeah. So we we had a workers comp ghost policy last year. It looks like we switched from M Trust to somebody else. So I got a letter from them and listen I completely forgot about it's on me I guess I don't know what it came in but they did an audit and they're like hey we want another 2, 400 bucks. It's a ghost policy. It doesn't even cover anything. Um, why why would that change? I guess like I I think my premium was like 1, 500 bucks. And I get a letter that says hey you need to send us another 2, 300 dollars because we did an audit. What did they audit? Because like I have no employees, and it's a it's a ghost policy. They don't cover anything. Okay, so let me get you over to the commercial side because I cannot answer that question. I think whenever you called in, it pulled up your personal account. Oh I got you. Just make sure whenever you do call in because your your number is linked to both accounts. Just let them know which one which one it's for that way they'll get you to the right um. Okay cool I appreciate it. Let me transfer you over to the other department. Okay. Okay awesome thanks. You're welcome.
