Hello. Good morning, Karen. Hi, how are you? Hi Karen, I'm doing well. This is Jamie here at Life Insurance. How are you this morning? Hi. Good good. I just listened to your voicemail. I'm sorry we missed you, but I think it's probably okay to just go ahead and forward that check to the body shop. Okay. But but I think just to make sure that everybody's on the same page, I'm going to push an email to Drew. Drew Settums is the claims adjuster that is assigned to this is in regards to the 22 Dodge Durango. Yeah. Yeah yeah so so Drew is the adjuster. And I think I'm going to forward a note to him that I'm giving you this instructions and that just reach out to you directly if something is wrong with that I guess. Oh. I don't I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be because it you know obviously if the if that vehicle is going to get repaired there and they've already made the check out anyway but I I think it's probably fine to forward it but. I'm going. That's what I was you know I have no problem you know forwarding it you know or dropping it off to them and stuff like that taking a ride yeah now to drop it off I just you know that way they can start buying the stuff too you know. Yeah yeah I think it's probably okay but truthfully transparently those questions probably need to get answered by the way they do need to get adjusted answered by the adjuster rather and so I'm just going to push him a note and just let him know that we spoke this morning. And that I told you to go ahead and drop the check off at the body shop and I'm certain that if anything is different with that you'll reach out to you directly okay. Okay. All right. Perfect. Outside of that, is there anything else you need this morning? Everything else okay. I hope. Yeah no everything else is good. I have no other issues. What was that? I said it's good as it can be. I hope. Yeah yeah like I said I mean the the body shop can't get me in till the 20th of December and at first we were like ah but my husband said that's how you know it's a good body shop and then I happened just to mention their name and everybody said no they're really good they're honest and so if that's what it is that's what it is so I'm fine with that. Yeah yeah it's you know having a good mechanic or a good you know hick sometimes just having a good handyman in your in your back pocket is worth its weight in gold so you know body shops like that are they stay the good ones they certainly do stay busy so. Well Karen I hope you guys continue to do well if you need anything else please let me know oh that's yeah you know I'm going to send all all is good there I will copy you on the email that I send to Drew that way there's a okay paper trail for all this okay okay perfect thank you so much I appreciate. You are very welcome I hope you have a great day we'll talk soon. Okay bye.
