Hey Heather, this is David Perez. Oh, hey David, how's it going? Good. Did I catch you at a bad time? Uh-huh. No, it's a perfect time. Actually, we just got out of our our Tuesday morning meeting, so it's perfect. Yes. Those are those are lovely morning meetings, aren't they? I know, I know, and it's like all my customers are like, "Are you always in a meeting?" No, it just happens that way. But yeah, we usually have one on Tuesday morning and then tomorrow morning of course. So. Yeah. Um, I did get your email. And yes, man. Okay. And I've heard of Travelers. I think I've actually we were we've been insured by Travelers in the past. But I've never heard of what is it the the auto owners. Auto owners. Yeah. So David, we they're like our top carrier, auto owners, and since the mighty, we write more business with those two carriers than anyone. And of course, Travelers is like you said you've heard of them. It's part of Hartford, so yeah, they've been around forever too. But yeah, auto owners have been around since like nineteen thirty years. They're they're financially stable carrier as well. And I write a lot of business with them. That's what I sent you too, just because they were pretty close that I can remember. I am trying to get it up right now, but I usually I like to send two proposals that they're close just because some people like you like I've heard of Travelers you know they've heard of this auto owners so. Right, right. Yeah. Well, I am I am interested in the auto owners. Okay. So. Was it a little bit less or was it like I said my computer is trying to get? Yeah, it was. It was probably about. I am thinking sixty five seventy dollars less than Travelers. Yeah, it wasn't much. That's what I. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, the only you know my only advantage that I can see with that is if they're comparable because you know the way that the insurance business is is that unfortunately although we'd like to stick with one one company you know we can you know sometimes you have to go to another one and then come back and then go back and then come back you know just to keep. Right. It's more work for you. Been like that lately. Well, and that's the good thing about being an independent agency. We do have that ability to to do it for you. You know that's our job. You know. Is to we're in the market for that. You know we want to keep you at a competitive rate. And yeah, it's been like reshoping every year. It's for the past three years. I feel like or more because of the steady you know increase. God, we're hoping it's going to level off. You know it's got to. I don't know how people are going to afford anything at all if it can keep together like it's been going the past couple years. Yeah, our our health care insurance is going up one hundred and forty percent. Oh my god. Yeah. So it's just the insurance is is quite quite quite costly at this point. It is. Yes, it is. But anyway, so as you know from my old policies, so we already have a. Our home policy is actually was paid for in September. So at least if my memory serves me correctly, what I would have to do is is and I am assuming that this price is for the package deal. It is. Yeah. Yeah. It is. Right. Um. You paid. I just pulled up your homeowner's policy. Did you pay in full for that, David? I did. So it was fifteen oh four. It looks like that sounds about right. That was you paid. No, we paid eleven forty nine. I think. For the homeowners, I think that fifteen oh four may be what if if you were to and also doesn't bill auto every year or the option. They bill it every six months, so they you know they they raise your rates every six months. Gotcha. Yeah, I am just looking at the debt that you sent me. It says total premium. If you pay in full, it's sixteen twenty four. If you pay in full, it's fourteen oh four. I am trying to find the date. Yeah, that was September nineteenth twenty twenty five through twenty six. Yeah, that was one of the ones that no, I know we didn't. That was one of the ones that we had. You know and and and you know what you got is. You had to have whatever your system downloads because I didn't send you anything. You know that happened when you sent me the link and I you know whatever process that is Gotcha. You know, and that's still high in my opinion, but that's still I think you know. Yeah. That's why I was trying to go back to make sure we could you know see where we could adjust something, but. Yeah. Let's see. Because they're you know, and I've expressed this before. You know, they're ensuring you know general contracting, you know fees, which I'm I was a general contractor for you know like the addition I mean that's something that I do we bought the spec house so we had no choice but to have that but. You know they're they're ensuring real estate fees and they're ensuring land. The land. They're ensuring the land, but the land's not going to burn away. You know you are not going to rebuild the land. Right. All right, we did sort of a bunch of extras. This is the AG seven homeowner form that we write on. I don't know if you are familiar with the different homeowner type forms. No. What you currently have is just your standard homeowners HO three form. David, we typically write on AG seven, which is a much better policy. You are getting guaranteed replacement cost. With the additional twenty five percent, of course, which you have on the HO three, it's one hundred twenty five percent insured. And we've got you know five hundred thousand mobility, which we don't write less than that, but that's only like two or three dollars difference. We've got you twenty five hundred dollars of that. Looks like that's what you had. I was trying to compare with what you have. So. So. Go ahead. I am sorry. And the sorry, I am just I went back and took off the extras if you will. We have the identity theft. You do not have that, and that's something we can talk about if you are interested in it. But we that was just the way I send it was our standard quotes right how we typically do it. You don't have refrigerated costs on there. Identity theft. Let's see what else there. Equipment breakdown. Let's see. So removing those, I removed equipment breakdown, identity theft. I removed. I think I did the refrigerated. What's equipment? What's equipment breakdown? It's kind of like a warranty, like on your appliances, major appliances. It's it's like a warranty, like you take a warranty out when you purchase like a washer and dryer or your HVAC system. It would it would cover like if something happens to it. For like they say for you know something happens to it, but then you have to be careful of normal wear and tear as well. So you know they're not going to cover it if it's just normal wear and tear. Right. Yeah, and see here is the thing: is like you know everything we have is brand new. Well, it's a year old though. So I don't know that at least for this year. I mean maybe in a few in a future future you know something down the road maybe it it'll be more profitable with do some or more you know better to to pay for that for the risk you know but. Right. And I was going to say you probably have. Yeah, I was going to say you probably have warranties on everything. Yeah, yeah, exactly. But it's you know if it's caused by mechanical, electrical, pressure system failures stuff like that. Again, it can't be some just normal wear and tear. Right, and we don't like I said we don't need like the refrigerator kind of like of warranty as well or or not warranty but you know insurance. You know we've we've got battery not battery but we got generator backup so you know we're not going to we're not going to lose power for any extended period of time. All right, so I remove the equipment breakdown, identity theft, the refrigerated costs. So right now it's less than what I sent you. Actually, it's one thousand sixty. If you paid in full. It's how much now? How much was that quote you said? Hang on one second. Did you let me just make sure I got all the discounts on here? Did you tell me? I know you said the backup generator. Did you have central alarm? We do yes. Fire CPI. And then the backup generator. We're getting there, David. There with me. Just double check and have you saying. So I got your coverage of five thirty four two. That is when I of course because we added the square footage. Personal property, I got it to the lowest I can get it at three seventy three nine forty. Do you feel like that? Plenty. Again, and all this is replacement cost. Fortunately, the things that would that are you know of value that would come anywhere close to that would have to be under a different insurance policy. So. So yeah, so that's Yeah, I mean, I think what's coming up. Yeah, that's how much they want to charge us. Yeah. Seven ninety-one in that state. I think we have like a. There's a thirty-dollar or something discount that we get from. What do they call it? Drive wise or something like that. Where they kind of. Yeah, you can do all the carriers now have like a. An app that you can install. Right. It just it helps you if you're a good driver for sure. Or if you don't drive at all, I tell everybody to work remote. Install it, download it, whatever. I mean. As long as you're a good driver, you're not breaking hard. You're not you know it just tracks your braking acceleration and time of day and night you're driving and how often. Or your mileage. All right. So we've got multi-policy discount on this auto. I've got Honda Ridgeline 2011 Honda Ridgeline 2022 Nissan Rogue. And you and Diana. Correct. Oh, and now. I wanted to. You had mentioned to me before that on the homeowners. That you needed to put in my daughter's name in there. My daughter and her husband as living in the household. Oh yes. But they have their own insurance, right? They do, and actually I told them about I told them about you and they may be. Calling you because they're. They're currently I think with Erie. Insurance. Yeah. But. So yeah, they got they have a couple of cars and they have. They have rent. They have renters insurance. But. Okay. I am going to run those reports. Then we don't run those until we hear back from you because each charges. See, your driving record's clean. Right, everything should be good. Only thing it's bringing up is a comp loss. It looks like maybe a glass or. Seventy-seven dollars. On a comp. In 2024. For a window. Yeah, that was a windshield that. Yeah. All right, and then what about the coverages on the auto? We've got a thousand deductible on those. Correct. Okay. And I don't. Yeah and and. Yeah, we really don't. I mean, we I don't need that much insurance for the the Honda Ridgeline. But unfortunately, I think because we have the umbrella policy, I think there are some minimums that have to be put in. Is that correct with this company? It is. I mean, the liability limits are is across the board across the policy two fifty five hundred. Now, as far as like comprehensive and collision, you're not required to carry that. But we have a thousand dollars deductible for comprehensive and collision. Right. Yeah. Hmm. And then we did not quote towing and labor and rental. Right, right. Um. Let's let's let's. I don't know that you've we've really changed anything. I mean, our you know. You know we don't go to work on a regular basis, but if we're retired, so. So I don't know how that does because I know that they insure you based on. You know how you know what your distance is to your workplace and so forth and so on. I've got each one listed as pleasure that y'all are retired. So yeah. Okay. And that's how much eleven. Eleven hundred dollars and something for the year. Let me make sure it didn't change that we are in the report. So we're going to leave the coverages the same, not changing any of those. You want to keep the comprehensive collision on the Ridgeline. Yeah, I'm thinking about leaving that, but maybe we'll maybe we can play with the deductible on that one maybe. And go up a little bit on it and see just what difference that may be. So I just kind of want to get a sense of where we are. See. So is it twelve hundred, twelve hundred eighty-seven. Oh, interesting. That's different. That's different from what the quote you sent me. Yeah, I don't know if that's running the reports. Change. Because I haven't changed anything. So if you were to change the Ridgeline to like fifteen hundred dollars. Oh, it just went up by two dollars. Was it? It was eleven ninety-eight. Right, and you said it. And you said now it's it's two it's twelve hundred and eighty-seven dollars. Eighty-seven cents. Oh. It's like two bucks. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, just leave that alone then. Yeah, we're we're good there. I thought you got another ninety dollars. Uh-huh. I thought like no, that comp claimed it and do that. No, it's twelve hundred even well twelve hundred eighty cents. Let me make that clear. She's got a birthday in today. You say eleven twenty-eight. Yes, that one. My oldest daughter doesn't want to celebrate a birthday, and our youngest daughter wants a birthday month. So you know she won't celebrate the entire month. Very different. So who else in the household? Is it you and your wife and Crystal and her husband? Correct. And what's her husband's name? Gray. G R E Y. Steadman. G R E Y. A Y. A Y. What did you did you get his birthday? Yeah, twelve eleven ninety-two. I have no clue. I'm gonna assume it's sixteen. Then he'll have a birthday after that. Yep. Oh, guys. All right here at Christmas too. They are married. Okay. I'll see you to let me go ahead and get that out of here. With the driver's license that we're not writing down. He said they are with Erie. Correct. How is their driving record? Is it good? Have they had any accidents? I'll be honest with you. I don't know. Adriana, have they had any accidents? Have they had any accidents that they claimed anything on? Chama, he was Chama. Chama, yeah, that's great. Oh, that's great. He's had a loss instead, August the fourteenth, twenty twenty-four. Yeah, and he said that that was. She just said that was a hit and run. Okay, so we're still at twelve hundred eighty-seven dollars. Twelve hundred, twelve hundred dollars eighty-seven. Okay. All right, and then the umbrella. Yeah, this is. There's really nothing. Oh, that's right. You know. Right. Well, if if you can do your side, the thing, excuse me, that you need to do on your side is just. All I need to do is pull the trigger kind of thing. You know I will be. I'm going to try to wait as close to my renewal as possible. Which is in actually a couple of weeks. For the auto right. Yeah, the auto and the umbrella come up in a couple of weeks. Right, yeah, December second. It looks like your auto. And umbrella, December third. I would like that. I think I would just keep them all on the same date. If you want to do twelve one or twelve two. Yep, that's perfect. And just keep it simple. I'm just looking over your auto site because it's got decline medical payments, towing labor, rental. Car rental and travel expenses, and I think the only thing I've got on yours that. That differs from your current policy is medical payments. Okay. I don't think that's going to make a difference. Yeah, I mean I've got a thousand-dollar medical payment. So. I can take that off. You don't currently have them on yours. It's probably going to bring it back down to maybe two dollars. Eleven eighty-seven. Okay. That's interesting. So it's where we were originally at eleven ninety-eight. So if I remove the medical payments, it gets you down to. Okay. Are you good with that? Yeah. Okay. All right, so I'm just going to resend these dated and yes, I will call. I'll call auto owners. Is that? Who you're leaning towards and get that agreed. Okay. And if you can just if you're too. More about auto owners who they are. Okay, and also just let me. You know, as soon as you have the approvals, call me or email, or you can just email me. And I will go ahead and call all state and let them know not to renew anything. Okay, it is giving me. I am going to need their driver's license number. I thought I was going to be able to bypass it, but it just it's like I don't think it's going to affect anything. Have them text me. Have them text me both of their driver's license numbers. Yeah, if you want to just text me, David, when you get that. Those numbers, I'll be wonderful. Yeah, I can. I'll text them to you. Okay, all right. That sounds good. And I'm going to send these revisions. I'm going to call them first just to make sure, and then I'll email those over to you. The revisions. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Absolutely, thanks, David. Bye bye. Talk to you soon. Bye.
