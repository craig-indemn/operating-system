What you say next? Hey Rick, how you doing? Good, my brain good. How you been? Oh, pretty good. Thanks, I'm not walking too well, but the brain is working. I'm not sure which is worse. It makes the body or the brain to go first. I don't know. I haven't quite figured that out yet. Yeah, yeah, I know. Yeah, I guess John Daly knows the secret to that. Just gripping and ripping, gripping and ripping, smoke cigarettes and drink a lot of beer. I don't know, but. The national general quote came in at 2621, which is that's that's damn good. Yeah, that's about a you know roughly a thousand dollars less than the auto owners quote Nick and I mean that's and that's a part of this whole conversation and and and as I as I know you understand it's just more to it than that okay and I just want to be sure that before we say to you yeah no problem let's just move the car insurance I need you to just be aware and kind of understand how that impacts potentially everything else that goes on with Nick and Emily Antonecchia you know as far as these policies go the the biggest thing I'll tell you the biggest impact that it will ultimately have if if we move it and I'm I'm probably going to end up suggesting that we move it but I need you to understand that you know your homeowners policy with auto owners your your umbrella policy with auto owners your current automobile policy with auto owners you know all of those things kind of exist together if that makes sense so there's discounts over here there's coverage relationships on this side of things that we're trying to be sure we duplicate and that's part of the you know the reason for you know for Tracy's questions and drilling down on these things that on the surface it's like why is she asking me all these questions as I just want to be sure that we you know kind of clear on that these things connect together in lots of different ways that aren't as obvious as maybe you know maybe they they they they are to me as they would be to you if that makes any sense I understand yeah so if we if we say to you all right we're going to move the automobile to National General I'm what I've asked Tracy to confirm and she's working on this is will auto owners who writes a two million dollar umbrella liability policy for you will they go over someone else's automobile policy like National General I think they will but we have to be sure about that because what I would not want to do is say to my auto owners underwriter look we got to move this automobile insurance and and then they come back and say well that's great but we're not going to let our umbrella go over National General so we have to confirm that Tracy's working on confirming that they will allow that okay so that's something that we have to be sure about assuming that they will and I feel I feel pretty confident they will the other part of it is that when your homeowners policy renews next year with auto owners if that's where it stays you know you'll lose about a you know 10 12 percent discount off of that premium that you're getting right now for having an automobile policy with auto owners so you know that can drive that premium up four or five hundred bucks you know so just just try to be clear yeah just kind of so then the net savings would be less than a thousand dollars that's that's that was what my point was Nick by the time all of this fleshes out the net savings in 2026 rates you know could be you know could be five or six hundred bucks could be four or five hundred bucks kind of depending on how the math goes and and and I just you know again just need to be clear about that Tracy has also you know gone to the effort and we asked her to do so listen where else could we go you know look for you know quote this we got 15 820 carriers in this agency Nick that write insurance for us where else could we go well she went to I mean I could run down a list of about a half a dozen carriers with you bottom line is nobody was lower on the automobile than auto owners was except for Progressive which was about 200 dollars less okay than auto owners once we once we accurately rated it and then and then National General at this number that you see everybody else was you know within either either pretty much the same premium or in some cases significantly more you know that that includes carriers like Cincinnati and Travelers and Utica some folks you may pen National I mean we she she went down the list of our carriers and asked for those quotes to be done so you know just giving you the just giving you the workflow here what have what have we done as part of this analysis for you and at the end of the day where we seem to be landing is that and immediately you could probably realize you know thousand bucks or so savings Oh, it's not, and I refuse to rent that place for less than thirty five hundred dollars a month. I really want four thousand in a winter. Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't blame you. I know how nice that place is. I mean, I, I don't know that's a that's a strange, strange dynamic. Since, since you were in there last time, yeah, I have done thirty thousand dollars worth of improvements in there. New carpets, new tile floors, new appliances. I got brand new fifteen hundred dollar, which are four thousand dollar, ceiling mattresses on the bed. Yeah, I, I did a, a walk in shower in the second bathroom. Oh, that works. It was twelve thousand dollars just for that. So the place is totally different than when you and I got big screen TVs everywhere. So well, let's talk. Yeah, well, let's talk about that for another second before we before we part. Let me just tell you with how your condo policy is written. Okay, we have coverage for it's it's called it's it's combined A and C, which means it's combined dwelling and personal property coverage. We have a hundred thousand dollar limit on this policy, Nick. Um and and you know I don't know that that's too low. I don't know that it's too high, but I just want to give you the limit, remind you what it is, and say to you all right. You know you've spent this money, you've made these improvements. Um, you know I don't know I don't know what's going to happen to that building besides a hurricane, right? If a hurricane happens and and the roof blows off the building and all that stuff is flooded and you got to redo all of that. You know that was you've got a master policy. I'm sure there's an association master policy on that building. But it doesn't cover your. But it doesn't cover your
