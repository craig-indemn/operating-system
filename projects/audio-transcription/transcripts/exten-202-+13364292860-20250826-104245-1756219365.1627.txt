Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Hey, it's Deborah. Hey, I just got your voice mail. Sorry, delay. Oh, there ain't no delay. I appreciate your personal service. Yes, no problem. Hey, would it matter? No, he it's not a revolving, um, equity line. Um, would it matter if we adjusted our deductible? Yes, so what I need to do is call AO and have them, um, undo the cancellation so we can go in and make changes as far as deductible and the mortgage and then see where we are. So if that works, if that works for you. Okay. And then I can give you a call back with that info, but right now I just need to get auto owners to release the the policy where we can actually access it. Is it cheaper to have um now? Can I keep my auto with another company or does that affect the auto the homeowners being lower too? Um, as far as the the auto, it was with a different carrier. Okay, so I'm good to keep my auto separate, right? Yes, you would be fine with that because we were um. We were already separate. You were getting a discount on the auto for the home, but not vice versa. So we would be okay with just the home. Okay, then I'm good. I got my auto is is less, so I'm good with keeping my auto fine. So we'll just look at keeping. If you could find out if we we don't need a lower deductible because we have funds somewhere else. God forbid that something else happened to our home. We would be able to. We would be able to find other funds. We wouldn't want to use them, but we could find other funds somewhere. So and it wouldn't be an equity line that we would have to use. So I'm probably talking too much, but I don't care. We've known you for a while. No, you're fine. So let me call auto owners, get this released, and then I can give you a call back with deductibles and making sure that that mortgage free discount is back on there and then we'll go from there. Okay. Okay, I'll be there. Thank you. Uh huh. Bye bye. Bye.
