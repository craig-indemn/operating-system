Sorry for help. This is Cody. Help you. Hey Cody, it's Jennifer. Hey, how are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing all right. That's good. Hey, do you think you can get me a better quote from Mario? Um, and I don't know what his name was. Westfield one. The G. F. Installation, I want to say it was. FG installations. Yes. The one that I quoted a few weeks ago or whatever. You think I can get a better quote? Yeah, he said it's too much. Yeah, I mean that's not only option for him. I mean he was a new installer, no prior insurance, all that right. Yeah, and that's just that's just what it is these days. I just don't have I don't have the options I used to have anymore to be able to offer like these super cheap quotes. Okay. Unfortunately, there's just not many options for installers anymore, especially new guys and stuff. Like it's a miracle I even got Westfield to start writing these guys without prior and you know helpers starting their you know own crews for the first time and stuff like that. Yeah, because um he says that it's too much for him, but I'll tell him that. I mean, how much these guys can make if they're working. So I mean. Yeah. I know it's expensive to run a crew. You got to pay your guys. You got to maintain your truck and trailer and all this stuff and tools and I mean I get that but. Um. The risk is just too high. Yeah, it's went up a lot. Too many claims and stuff, and there's no companies that will write installers anymore hardly. And they're just not going to get those cheap quotes anymore like they used to be able to get even a few years ago much less 10 years ago. Um. There's just nothing else that I can do for him. I mean, I'm having to basically paint the best picture possible to my underwriter just to be able to get them to approve these quotes. You know. Yeah, understand. Um, I can't remember. Let me look and see what his quotes were. FG installations. So his workers comp was 7, 300. We had 142, 400 payroll, which means you had 80, 000 for his helpers plus him being included. I mean, that I mean honestly the workers comp is. Just it's actually cheaper than what it used to be through AmTrust because AmTrust was like a 40% debit, which means they're making it 40% more expensive. Than it the base rate, so like the workers comp quote is cheaper than what a AmTrust like a AmTrust policy with 142, 000 payroll. Would have been more like 9, 000 or something like that, and this quote this quote 7, 300. The package is the one that's you know a good deal more because I used to be able to do them with like nationwide for like 1,500 bucks, but at the same time. Yeah. Nationwide, you know they quit writing installers like two years ago. Yeah, because I remember when, Wilmer had it with them, and it was really cheap. Yeah, it was like 14, 1500 bucks something like that. Yeah. Um. That's just not an option anymore. There's just there's there's no companies out there they're going to do it for that anymore. Yeah. Because yeah, because this package is 48. 95, so that's the one that's you know three times what a nationwide used to be or whatever. But honestly, I mean, the policies that are done correctly, you're not really going to get anything cheaper. I don't think if it's if it's being done right with all the correct endorsements and stuff that they need. Yeah. It's really not going to get anything cheaper. So it's so it's 73 plus 48. I mean, you're looking at about 12, 000 a year, 1, 000 a month for GL in the marine and workers comp. That's just about as good as you're going to get these days for something that's done correctly. Yeah. Okay. I mean, I get that it's a good amount of money, but at the same time, one little small claim will blow these premiums out of the water. You know what I mean. Yeah, yeah. So they shouldn't say it's too much or they can't afford it because I know how much money they make. So. Yeah, I think it's where he's just beginning and. I get that and obviously there
