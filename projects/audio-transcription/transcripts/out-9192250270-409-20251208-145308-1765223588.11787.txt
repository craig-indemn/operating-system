Hello. Hey David, this is Corbin. Hey brother, how are you? I'm good. So you got some fun stuff going on with your payments. Yeah, I got this. One day I got this. I need to sign this for the Glausman House and the Lake House Gondola, and I was like, "All right, I must be good to go because I'm one got sent from your crew for wasn't good and then all of a sudden I see this credit card statement for nearly fifteen thousand like what the hell is that. " I know I saw that too. And then I saw your for the cars at eleven thousand. So I'm like, "Yeah, this one. " So yeah, yeah. So they're they're sending a refund of thirty two ninety three eighty six on the auto. Looks like they didn't give your kids driving experience. Why did it go up over three grand from last year and nothing's changed? So last year it was it was like eight something or seven something. I forget what it was. I mean, what a huge. Let's see. My computer would go faster. Yeah, I saw it because once I logged in and got an account, it showed me what we paid last year for four of us compared to this year. I thought it would have gone down because my kids already had a driving experience as well. But it three grand's crazy. Yeah, I've looked. Come on, computer. What did he? Now it's. I have a couple. Maybe it's because I got another one of their websites open. Okay. Don't know what don't know which one to open. Let's see, go out of it and go back in. Let me close and this close close. Oh. Nice one, General. Twamley. Yeah. Eleven six zero seven. Yeah, looks like it paid seventy nine sixty seven last year. Yeah, I mean. Oh, you're getting you're getting a refund on that too. Yeah. Got thousand seventy nine fifty five. Yeah, I was just wondering what this monster disconnect is right here. Well, let's see. You have a tiering of eight last year, voluntary eight. Make sure. Um. You're still voluntary eight. Well, and then you added a new vehicle. See. Yeah, I did. Oh, they took so somehow that that app, the Dynamic Driver app, came off too. And the twenty Tesla's replaced by the twenty five Tesla. Yeah, but you see where I'm going over three grand delta. That's nuts. That's like a whole other car, and then some. Well, I wonder since the premium is so high that um. That Dynamic Driver is a pretty good discount at the premium's higher. Let's see. Dynamic Driver. Nobody has it. I mean, we can do it all over again. I I didn't know know about the app or anything. We installed all of us installed it before like you told us to and it's on our phones. Well, for some reason, like when I look at the drivers, typically if I have the Dynamic Driver on there, it's got email and everybody's phone number. But in this in your term this time, there's no there's no email or phone number except for yours. So somehow I got kicked out. I would need to add everybody's back in. Let me see if I got everybody's Twamley. And I could see what that would do. Let's see what that would do. Okay. Anyway, if I added that on today, let's say tomorrow. That confuse them too bad, and then. See. Dynamic driver, yes, yes, yes, and yes. Continue. Still got the twelve points. That'll be like last year. Yeah, just everything was pretty much the same as last year. That's why. Your paperless multi policy transfer credit. That would give down to ten thousand six zero seven. Still up there in it. Yeah. So it it would take off nine hundred eighty dollars if you get the Dynamic Driver. But I'd need to make sure I got everybody's drivers. I mean, we I don't know we shop around. I mean, that's just that's a monster change. But it's literally a whole other car. I can definitely look for sure, but they're usually really good with inexperienced drivers. That's the thing about them. Yeah, can you call them and say, "Hey, just go what what the hell happened? " I mean, thirty over four almost four grand difference from one year to the next. I mean that's that's insane. But yeah, eight thousand to eleven. Right. Let's see. I don't have Katie's email or phone number, and I need. All right, you had it last year. Let me get it up. Yeah. Yeah, I don't have it anywhere in my systems. I don't And then. That's the second time I saw nine nine nine number. Yeah, the kids both have it. Pretty interesting. Yeah. So is it you think there's a way to get all this down, maybe a couple, couple grand. I just want to see if it makes sense. Yeah. And we did have a rate increase, but man, that's a big one. I understand totally. Yeah. Um. I get it for sure. See. Sorry, I'm very slow. Your son. Nine three nine. And then David, we got you at david dot tomley at bsci dot com nine one nine two two five zero two seven zero. Yeah. See, there's any other credits I can put on here. All right, so I got. Why do we have the business use on the Tahoe? I have no idea. Like, are any of these for business? Do you transfer on Amazon or something? No, not at all. What's that Tahoe use for? Just it's just my day-to-day car. And do you drive it to work or do you work out of the house or? I work out of the house. Yeah. And then. Well, I mean, they have it as business use for my. I think they put that on for my company. That's why they had it because I use that. I use Motis and Motis always wants a declaration to show that it's for business use. I guess. Oh crap. Okay, I got leave that on there. Okay, well I've had that for with you guys for years, so it shouldn't be a big of a deal. And then the Volkswagen Atlas driven to and from work. Yeah, just just school and back for my kids. All of them BMW and the Tesla same thing. Yeah. She were from work. Yep. See. The Tesla's got a fifty-eight sixty-seven. The BMW's got a forty-six forty-nine. The Volkswagen's got a thirty-nine twenty-six. And then the Tahoe is a thirty-six twenty-two. Thirty-six twenty-two. That's the lowest. So we need to put the kids on the lowest. Thirty-nine twenty-six. So which one does Taylor drive? The Atlas, the Volkswagen. And then Jackson. Is the BMW. Oh. See what that does. You got full coverage on everything. Five hundred dollar, five hundred thousand limit. Thousand dollar deductible. All right, so if I do. See that. All right, so everybody's going to email. So ten thousand six hundred seven. Still an increase. And I looked at the discounts. Um. The discounts are the same. Didn't you? Did you see that where? I don't know if you did it. Pull both deck pages from last year. This year. I just I just I pulled both of them this morning. I was just in shock and I was like, I just saw the total. That's where I went. I was just like, fuck, there's something going on here. So. So you're going to get an refund back of four thousand two hundred seventy four sixty eight. I mean, you're a tier eight. Um. So what I'll do is let me print this deck page, and then I'm going to have. My team quoted up with everybody. Okay. Tomley. See that Jen auto deck, declaration. Twenty-five to twenty-six. And then. Let me fix this to. This is off. Jackson. Taylor. And I got to talk to you about a couple more things too. I don't want to forget. Okay. Still some to do's out there. Katie. Fix her here. And you got that umbrella renewing. Did you get everything on that information and all that fun stuff? I think so. Yeah, I yeah I had some on my desk. Okay, cool, cool. Yeah. I want to news on the eleventh. Um. Let me do the requote. David. Oh, ready. So we'll run those rates. Let's see if we can get you something better, and then. Something else I need to run through with you. Let's see. Alarm certificate. Did you send that over to Holly by chance? I did. Yeah. Okay. Praisal of something. And then. I don't know about that one. Let me get it back over to. They are asking for the appraisal for the emerald valued at forty nine nine forty seven. For the what else? There is like an emerald. The diamond. Got to be forty nine thousand nine hundred forty seven. Yeah, I sent that. I sent that to you guys a while ago. Originally, you guys should have it on your file. I don't why I am having to resend this stuff. November thirteenth. Let me see this thing here. I'll send. Let me send Holly. Note that. Just double check it. Yeah, I mean when we first got all this insured, the appraisal came to you guys and. Yeah, I think we got it for sure. Okay. Yeah. I believe. I don't think you would have gone through. Yeah. Spoke with David. Said. He said the appraisal. A couple years, few years, few years ago. Yeah. Problem is we got a new system probably a half a year ago. That system nothing came over really, but we can might be able to pull it. Um. See. And then. See what else. Lower RCE. Okay, so this is um. She sent her certificate. Tell him to tell her that too. Yeah, I have that certificate. I know Holly's got a thing for it. Let me ask her. See. I think the last one is this RCE. December fourth. Okay, so we got this from the underwriter. We recently conducted a survey of one fifty Gundola Road, Moresville. We wish to communicate the following: the replacement cost estimate. Has been updated to reflect the changes resulting in a change from. This is weird. This usually never happens: four hundred seventy-five thousand three hundred sixty-one to four hundred forty-eight thousand thirty-eight. They just want to let you know that. So it went down in value. Well, replacement value which which is okay. It's not a and it's not a huge thing. They're just letting you know we need to. Drop that coverage amount down and. Honestly, I've never seen one have it go down. So. Yeah, what's going on? Well, that's you know we moved it so that's they're just doing their job. The the people that went out to inspect it they're they're coming up with a value of four thirty eight, which is fine. Not a big deal, but. We were pulling the numbers from the prior coverage carrier, so the the two carriers being different is not. Is not abnormal. Um. But typically, I'd never lower the coverage amount unless. But they're just doing their job. I mean, the inspection company goes out and gives what they think the value of replacement value is, and then. Um. Okay, on the coverage. Amount. If it was with the same carrier and they we rerouted it and they said it go down, that would be weird. But it's different companies, so different companies have different. Okay. Thing and you know like if you leave it with travelers, you know for three years or four years, you know they're going up a percentage. They really don't have an idea what they're doing. They're just throwing it up a percentage, and then we get take it to a new carrier. They're using all the actual numbers. Well, the thing too is it's a lake house, so when contractors and builders look at a lake house, they see dollar signs. So I know it's not a big deal. I am big elder this time, but. They just they gouged the shit out of you for no apparent reason at all. So. Oh, you come out the the people doing the repairs. Yeah. Yeah, just anything. I mean, I know this guy came out and just reduced the cost, but I don't think he's ever. But they're they're gonna they're gonna replace it like if it burn out to the ground they're gonna put it back the way it how much it costs if it costs them five hundred eighty thousand. It's their fault, you know. They. You know what I am saying? Like if they value this thing lower than it should be, it's not your issue. Okay, all right, all right, fair enough. The coverage amount change is. I think that's all I need to cover. Um. Yeah, well, let me know if you can drop that down a few grand. Um, that'd be lovely. And then the only every time I quote it, you know like we it
