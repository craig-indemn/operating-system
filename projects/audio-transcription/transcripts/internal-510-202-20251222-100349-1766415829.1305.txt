Hello, hello, hello. So Mark Johnson is here. He's the one that we looked at JUA on for that. Kevin. Uh huh. He is. I think we're wanting to proceed. What day though? You need to tell me effective date. Okay. There's not a waiting time on those, are they? No. Okay. Nope, not on NC JUA policies. I can't remember. It's been a while. Yeah, only flooding. Okay. So um. Can you help me? Get the app, so he can sign it and give me some new law. I can let me pull it back up here. Yep, it's under Mark and Paula. I gotta make a um. A current opportunity because we had it. I think we were communicating in the one that we did last year. Yeah. I believe we were too. Well, I thought he was going to flake on me again, so I didn't. He rolled his eye out at me. Okay. What are the what's the standard deductible on this? Let me look. Because that's a mountain one, so here it is. Freaks me out for just a moment. I couldn't find it. Okay, he's got a 500. This quote is a 500, and then it goes up in 500 increments: 1015. And then 20025, 3000, and so on. Okay. Do you want a low deductible? Because right now it's quoted at 500. Or do you want us to go up to like a thousand or fifteen hundred? What you pay if something happens. Five hundred is what we have have quoted it for. So the lower the deductible, the higher the premium. So. Do you want her to look at a thousand and see what the difference is between 500 and a thousand? Okay. What was 500 again? I don't even remember. Let me check. I haven't wrote with JUA since I was at Farm Bureau, so this is why I'm calling you. I'm sorry. Oh no, you're fine no worries at all. 500. It's deductible at 697. Um. Let's see here. 1000. Is. 671 I think it was. 671 for a thousand. Yeah, it's not huge. Yeah, 671 for a thousand. So what twenty. Eight dollars savings. For the extra 500 out of pocket. Okay. I would say just do 500. That's only a savings of 26 dollars. That's what it is. 671. 671 for a thousand. 697 if you do the 500. Yeah. Was 697 right? Yeah. So I would say do that. 26 dollars. What's that? Not a lot. Not a lot, but the difference would be you'd be paying 500 more to save 26 dollars if something happened. So pay 26 more now and you pay 500 dollars left later. Right, but this is for your peace of mind. Right. Uh huh. Okay, let's just go with 500. Okay. Right on. We were curious about the protection class that he's under. There though. Is it pulling like a a nine or or is it better than that? Let me look. But you said it was a substation close to. Don't you live like to? Pulling us a three. It's pulling us a three. Yeah. Okay, so that's good. Yeah. Yeah. Protection class three is good. Where do you live at in in Surrey though? Remind me. Pine Ridge Road. So you've heard about all this fire department talk that they're talking about. Because technically I'm in Franklin District for the fire department. I live right there, Anya. But is I just wonder if their response time is going to be a lot longer. Check your teams. The Bayern sound one. And then as far as payment, can I just take. Um, a card and then we can process payment. Or do how do I need to take that? No I O E this is this is not. Is paying full. Yeah, he will. But let me just take a look. Sorry, I got you just diving right into my stuff and didn't even. Oh no problem. You had anything going on. I'm just redoing that whole. Mansion. You said the mansion. That big one that I wrote in Oak Ridge. Chad's. Yes, we are just hit the issue on the homeowners with travelers. And now I've got to do the inland. But naturally, it's not canceled smoothly because travelers doesn't put. Equipment
