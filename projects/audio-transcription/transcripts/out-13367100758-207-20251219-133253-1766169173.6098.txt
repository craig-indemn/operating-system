Somebody messaged me from the office and said you would try to call a few times, but I never got a voicemail or anything from you. So I'm not sure exactly what's going on. I think it has to do with moving a vehicle around. If you could give me a call back, please. I'll be here for another hour or so before I have to go pick up my kids from school. My phone number is three three six seven eight six eleven thirty three. If you don't reach me before I leave, I'm happy to help on Monday. I think Gloria said you might be planning on coming in Monday, but I wanted to go ahead and give you a call. All right, thank you so much. Bye.
