Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Yes, I want to pay my car insurance. Okay, is this Lisa? Yes, ma'am. All right, Lisa, let me see if I can help you out with that. So it looks like it's a progressive policy. Okay, it's going to take me just a second here. You doing okay? Yes. I have to set up an auto pay, but right now I do not have my checking account or my routing number on me. So today I'm just going to pay with the debit card. And next week I'll call during the week for you guys to set up an auto pay. Okay, all right. Yep, we can do that. Okay, so it's showing the amount due is 286 and 15 cents. And you said you're going to pay with a card, is that right? Yeah, my debit card. Okay, go ahead with the card number. It's 4224960099202548. And the expiration. Six twenty nine. Oh, expiration date. Yeah. I'm sorry, I gave you the the secret phone number. Expiration date is February of 2028. So 228. Okay. Yeah. Okay, Lisa. Um, do you want me to just email that confirmation over to you? Yeah, sure. But um, would that card stay on the file that way? If I forget to do the routing number or whatever, I just go ahead and take it out of my debit card. Um. No, if I mean if you want me to set you up on the credit card draft, I can. Um, it doesn't save that card in there. Okay. That was just a one time payment. Okay, then I'll just do what I I gotta send it to you guys. That way you just do auto pay. Okay, okay, yeah, just call us back and we'll get you set up. Okay, Lisa. All right, thank you. Thank you. You have a good weekend. You too. Thank you. Bye bye.
