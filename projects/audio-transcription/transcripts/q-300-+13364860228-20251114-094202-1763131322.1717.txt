It's a great morning on license insurance. This is Jamie. Hi, yes, um, my name is Kayla Dillon. I have a policy with you guys, and I just need a proof of insurance sent to the DMV or license plate agency, whatever is called. I can do that for you. Good morning. Let me just make sure I'm looking at good information here. My phone system pulled me into Kayla Dillon three three five one Dillon Farm Road in Winston. Yeah. Okay, give me one moment here. Okay, so I do have an active policy with National General. I've got you on there. With Joseph Lang and those two vehicles. Where does this need to be sent? Is there a fax number? Is there an email address? Do you want a copy sent to you to forward? They said they need a like. They just said they needed it digitally. Is all I was told. So, so typically there is a fax number that the DMV wants. To have like like and I apologize, Kayla. I don't know what that number is off top of my head. And I think there's actually a couple of different fax numbers unfortunately, and I don't know which one it would be. Did they mail you this request? Did they? Um. So I'm going to be asking. Bye. My husband is at the DMV right now, and I'm not with him. I'm getting ready to go meet him there, but um. Uh, I just he just told me that he needed proof because they wouldn't accept his paper proof that he was trying to give him. Oh yeah, I've unfortunately heard that too. Um, okay. So I don't know where. Let me see if I can Google something here. There will be. See the DMV fax number. Oh God, Google is not even telling me anything. A couple there. Let's see division of motor vehicles. Well, um. If you need me to wait till I get there to call back, that's fine. Sorry, I hate the you know because I'm certain he's probably standing in line and. God knows the DMV is a very fun place to hang out, but the. It really isn't. Let's see. I just didn't want to waste your time, you know. No, no, no, I, honey, this I'm a service agent. This is what I do. I just don't know how to help you here. I do know for a fact there is at least one if not multiple fax numbers for the DMV. And sometimes if the client needs something submitted electronically, that has to come from the actual insurance carrier. But that doesn't sound like what is needed here. It sounds like you guys just need to get this info to him. I don't know where to send it though. Hang on one second. Let's see. I'm still digging here. Anything out here? Send message. What does this do? Contact the DMV. Nope, that ain't it. Even the website has nothing on here. That's so helpful, right? I love the DMV. I shouldn't I shouldn't talk smack like that, but yeah. Oh, you know how it is. You can talk smack. I won't tell. I've had my own frustrations. I promise you. Other questions or issues. What is on here? No, that ain't it either. Oh my goodness. Um, I tell you what, Kayla. To hopefully get this quicker to you, I got Kayla dot Dillon one seven at gmail dot com shows up as your email. That could work an email for you. Yeah. Okay, all right. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull your your declarations page. I'm going to email it to you. Okay. When you get there, or if you want to call your husband and just ask if this needs to be faxed or some other way, it's got to get there. My name's Jamie. I will help you do this. I just don't know where to send it. Okay, I'm in office. Okay. Even though you can reply back to my email with whatever that information is, or you can just call back and I'll help you through it. Okay, but outside that, I'll just pull it and I'll send it to you. So if you guys have a copy electronically, and if it is as easy as forwarding over via email, then. You'll already be there for you. Okay. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay. Good morning. Bye bye now. All right, you too. Bye.
