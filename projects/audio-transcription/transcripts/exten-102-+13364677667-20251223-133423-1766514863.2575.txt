Hope you are. Yes, sir. Um, I just wanted to follow up on the proposal we just seen because we need to give the carrier, uh, confirmation so that they can have enough time to prepare for the renewal. Just so I see if everything looks okay and we should proceed with a, renewal. Okay, so I have not seen it. Did it go to Jeff Edson by chance? Um, I did send it to your email address. Let me just pull up your coms real quick. I tried to check my spam and stuff, and I do not have it. Okay, I mean. Okay, I sent it to nbel at gbngi dot com. That's where I sent it.
