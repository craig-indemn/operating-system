Thank for holding this, Gary. Ah yes, this is Melinda McDowell, and um, I just have a complaint and I need for somebody there to get to the bottom of it. We've been dealing with Jamie flipping, um, since July when you know they went over our policy for home and auto. We went through the process. We had I think, um, five cars and four drivers, but our daughter got married, so we did the whole declaration page and proved that she had her own insurance. Took her car, her as a driver off. So then we had four vehicles, three drivers. Um, I know Jamie explained us that across the board insurance was taking a price hike increase, but we had been paying for several several months, probably all of last year, three hundred and eighty five dollars and fifty four cents. Well, even taking that driver off and the car, and with maybe the price increase in September, we owed four hundred and five dollars sixteen cents, which I paid. But then October, now I know this is for home and auto. Uh, they were asking us to pay five hundred nine dollars and seventy nine cents, which I have not paid yet because I've been trying to get to the bottom of it. And I've emailed Jamie and he was supposed to be trying to get to the bottom of it. And then I called last Wednesday. I know it was late in the day, like four fifty. So they said they would get an agent to investigate and call me back Thursday, and I've yet to hear anything. What's your phone number, Miss McDowell? Three three six four zero two six zero two two. Six zero two two. I'm going to see if I can find out who's working on that for you. Okay. And see if we can expedite it for you. Yes, because he also noticed that for whatever reason back in the day they had given us two automobile policies, like so many cars were on one. And I think it was three cars on one, two on the other, and he said that some insurances which travelers that. Ah, you know they won't do, but so many cars on a policy. But now that we've only got the four cars, he was trying to get it all, you know, converted over to one automobile policy. And you know, that's all I know. And so it's kind of getting frustrating because I know now I'm going to have to probably pay a late fee because I haven't paid this five hundred and nine. Um, but we just wanted to get to the bottom of it before we did pay that. Right, I understand. Um, instead of me jumping in the middle here, I'm going to do a little research and find out how to work in it for you. Yes, thank you. And see if I can get them to call you back. Okay. That would be great. Thank you so much. You're very welcome. All right, talk to you later. Bye bye. Bye bye.
