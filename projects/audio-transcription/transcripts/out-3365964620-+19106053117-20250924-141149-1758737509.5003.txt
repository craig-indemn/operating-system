Hello. Hi, is this Morgan? It is. Hi Morgan, it's Elizabeth Queen with Signa. How are you doing? Hey Liz, I'm doing great. How are you doing? I am doing well. Did I catch that in the okay time? Yeah, yeah, just let me get outside real quick. No worries. Stay here with me, and I brought my mom to the hospital so she can get an infusion, and I'm back. So I'm trying to get out of here. Oh no, everything's okay. Oh no, it's fine. My dad ran over by accident with her car and broke her pelvis and all this other fun stuff. What? It was a crazy. It was a crazy accident, and then like so, the day I turned. It was when I turned 45. Yeah, I turned 45, and my mom called me and says, "Your father ran over me, and I can't get out." So, yeah, yeah, absolutely hilarious. So I was gonna say, I feel like I got the drink that you need to tell in a bar like. Exactly. Exactly. Everybody in my work could not believe it. They were like, "Your dad did what to your mom," and then the hospital was cracked. They weren't laughing, you know, but they were still loud. Yeah. No, I was gonna say you kind of have to laugh at that a little. Yeah, you kind of have. Well, I am glad that she is okay. I will say that and it wasn't much worse. Right. Yes. Okay. Let me put my glasses on so I can see your email. No worries, and I can go through all of this on the phone. You probably don't even need to see anything. That makes it easier. Okay, that's that's fine. Yes, and I will let you know first of all. So I was a benefit consultant broker for eight years myself before I transitioned over Signa about a year and a half ago. So I will tell you that I was in your shoes for many many years. I know how much fun this is. Oh, I know. Yes, and I actually did love it. But I left because my daughter has a health condition. So I decided to be a little bit more mom, but still I love the industry and all the crazy. But I will say. Just know, never super question with me. I'm here to help out, and I'm very excited to meet you. And hopefully this group goes very smoothly. Also, though I will say and I'm kind of honest to a fault, we are getting this in kind of as a late start. So just know. We will go as quickly as possible, but also we will make sure that proper expectations are set with the group. If that's fair. Yes, yes, and I when I had a meeting with them on Monday, I explained. The timeline and how much work was going to go into this, and they understood and they said, "Do what you got to do. " Let's get let's get away from Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Wonderful. One other item I will tell you, and I don't know if Max told you that, but because I was a consultant, I am very conservative. That's why I chose Signa for one of the reasons. But I try to never put groups in the negative for investment purposes on the very first like. Well, just because it's it's it doesn't make sense to buy the business. Signa doesn't buy the business because then on renewals they're already in a hole to dig out of. We don't want to do that, especially for the smaller group. So now when I came here, I didn't get a crystal ball. I don't know what the claims are going to look like after renewal, right? Like after we put them in, so we just look at you know kind of what is their risk score now. But right now the group pretty healthy, you know everything looks good. So we rated them, priced them appropriately, how they run, if what their renewal should look like, and you should get some data on it. Okay, perfect. Sound sound good, so that's kind of a promise. Right now, again, you don't know me from Adam, but a promise from me to you because I know how much work it is to move a group. I don't want you to have to move them again next year, and I know for the group for you and then also for the members the impact. Again, that's why I came to Signa. I think we do right groups appropriately or or we'll just decline them. We define more businesses than enough. So fair to say. And and and I explained that to the group. I said I very rarely get a quote from Signa. So if when I explained how conservative Signa
