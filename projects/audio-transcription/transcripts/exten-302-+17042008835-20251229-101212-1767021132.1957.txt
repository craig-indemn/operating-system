Thank you for holding this is on and I can help you. Hi Anna, this is Laura Taylor with Exp Realty and also the Power of Attorney for one of the policy or one of the people in Sir John Hill and Charlotte. I need to talk with you about their policy so we can get a closing done. Okay. Are you familiar with all the drama of Sir John Hill right now? Correct, I am. Okay, so I just got a thing from Cedar Management, the property management company, and I got a letter from the lender saying that the crime fidelity coverage is not sufficient. There's supposed to be a supplemental crime writer. In order for us to move forward, the HOA needs to add the managing crime writer to the current policy. The insurance agent will need to provide confirmation that the crime, the managing crime writer, has now been added to the HOA fidelity policy. I've never in 20 something years ever had this happen, but I need this to close for my mom's unit. Before we go to foreclosure, so I need to find out what that's going to cost because I'm I'm probably going to have to pay for it. So are you are you think are you part of Sir John? My mother is a as an owner there. In order to sell her unit, this has to happen. I'm gonna I can get Dale the Dale Powell the HOA president to call you to do this as long as I'm sure I pay for it. I just need to know how much is damage to pay for them. Yeah, so I can't unfortunately add it. Dale has to request it and Dale has been. I don't know until we request it from the carrier and we have to get the so there's a process we have to get the request in from Dale and Dale's been in these emails and he's not one yet not once requested it. If he requests to add it, we have to go back to the carrier for them to review it to see if they will even accept it before we are able to determine what the cost would be. So we don't even know if the carrier would even add. Like I said, it until we get a request from Dale or someone on the board or whoever. Send an email or call me and let me know they need to add Cedar Management for this crime. Then I will go to the carrier and ask them to do that. They will have to review it, but I can't promise 100 that they will do it. I just won't know until I send it in. Have you ever heard of such a thing? I haven't, but typically we don't have writers for property management, so this is not a normal request. Okay, because I mean I what I look at the guidelines for Fannie Mae. I think the the fidelity crime writer that they have is sufficient. Yeah, typically the property management should have their own crime. Is why we don't require it or put it on our policy because Sir John has crime coverage for them. We don't insure the property management, so we don't have a reason to add them to our insurance. But typically they should be carrying their own. So that's why we're confused and why is having to come back on Sir John's. But like I said, we we unfortunately I I wish I could help. I can't do anything until Dale or somebody from Sir John gives me that request. Okay, all right. Then we have to have it reviewed by the carrier too as well, just to make sure that they will even approve it. But like I said, I can't promise that they would. Okay, all right, sounds good. All right, I'll I'll call Dale. Thank you. You're welcome. All right, bye.
