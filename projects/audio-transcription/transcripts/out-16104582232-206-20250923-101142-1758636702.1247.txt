Travellers Bond. This is Jerry. Can I help you? Hey Jerry, good morning. Jeff Edmonds with Alliance Insurance Services in North Carolina. How are you today? Good. How are you today? I'm doing great. Hey, I need help in tracking down a document on a bond that we issued with you guys back in July. Okay. The bond number is one zero eight three one four three one four. Let's take a look and see what we got here for you. Okay. For front line steel structures. That is correct. Yep. All right. How can I help you? Well, she is emailing saying that she needs proof that her bond is active, that the NC Licensing Board received a notification of cancellation, and they did not receive anything saying that it had been reinstated. I'm trying to find documentation of either in the traveler site, and all I'm seeing is where the new business bond was issued. Yeah, I actually am not seeing it either. I see where we sent out the possible cancel. We sent a notice of possible cancellation if it wasn't paid, but it looks like it was paid on time. But sometimes that can create a little bit of an issue. I think that might be what's happened here. She's saying she received notice of cancel or they received notice of cancellation. It might have been a pending cancellation that you. Yeah, that's most likely it was. But let me do this. Let me um. Let me reach out to our bond department. See if there's something they can they can send over to me that I can email to you that'll. Can I forward you the email that she sent me or is it necessary? No, yeah, why don't you do that and then what I'll do is I'll piggyback that on over to them and hopefully they can send me like a. That'd be great. What is what is your email Jerry? It's going to be G as in Gerald, P as in Patrick, B as in Boy, U as an umbrella, R as in Robert, K as in kite, E as in Edward, J F Burke at Travellers dot com. Perfect. I will forward this to you and feel free to piggyback right to me. Definitely will. Thanks, Jerry. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye now.
