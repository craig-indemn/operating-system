Thank you for holding. How can I help you? Hi, this is Kelsey with State Co Insurance on a recorded line. I was calling with a claim status update for a mutual customer. Okay. And who's the client? It's uh Shelton Stevens. I have a policy number. This morning. Um, let me see here. Yeah, the pipe rupture. Uh, yes, so according to him, it's a toilet leak. It's like a long term wax ring leak. It's what I gathered from speaking with him. Gotcha. So it's going to be denied at this time, just for a long term gradual leakage language. I did explain all of that to him. I let him know that if he has any other questions or if there anything changes from the inspection or the mitigation process, to give me a call back. But I just wanted to let you guys know that so we're all on the same page. Okay, I'm just going to put a quick note on it and I will let the person know about the claim. Awesome, thank you so much. I appreciate it. Hey, you're welcome. Have a great day. Have a good weekend too. You too. Take care. Thanks. You too.
