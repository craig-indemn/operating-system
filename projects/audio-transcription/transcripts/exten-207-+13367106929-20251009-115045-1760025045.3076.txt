Hey, Crystal, how are you? Hey, Cody. Um, I'm sorry to bother you, but um, the other day I paid. I thought what was the last part of Travelers. But I did get a bill in the mail. I finally got something from them, but it says I owe another hundred and I don't know if it's sixty or seventy dollars. You said this was on the Travelers policy. Yeah, and I paid seven hundred and seventy. I think it was, and she looked at it. She said that's all that she was doing this term, but it's saying I owe another hundred and something. You get it pulled up here. And at the bottom it says, "Well, you'll see the bill. You'll see it." All right, so it renewed. Because when she read it, she told me I would owe anything until January. I don't know why she would have said that. Um. Because she said the term that the term was up, but it showed to be paid until then. That was supposedly that's what she said. I promised you know because I don't have no reason to lie about it but that's what she. No, you're fine. I'm just trying to look and see if I can get some sort of explanation. It looks like a payment was made on the 11th and the 22nd. Does that make sense? Let me look at this. I know I made one on the 20th. A minute, the most recent one is really recent. So. So we made that change on the policy. Remember where we increased the payroll. Yeah. And so that's obviously factored into it. You made two payments. Because there was a payment made on 911. Yes. For the September payment, I believe. Yeah. It would have been. But then you made a payment on the 22nd, 11 days later as well. Oh, well maybe I just didn't realize I had paid it. I didn't pay. Just because I'm trying to keep all this stuff straight, but sometimes I get messed up. I'm gonna watch you. So there's two payments that were made within, like I said, on 911 and then 922. There was a payment made on each of those days. But then it processed that payroll increase that we did too. So your installment for 1022 is only 1666, and then I imagined everything would balance out after that. Okay. It just doesn't show me like the installment schedule or anything like that. Just to know what the future installments would be. Well, see at the bottom of it though it says I still this says hold up a total remaining balance is 7, 630. Right because that change where we increased all you know we increased that payroll, that added 1446 to the policy. Okay. So you made those payments, but then the increase that we did is. Pretty close to the two payments that you made, which basically keeps the premium around what it was when it renewed. So then the remaining payments should be. I would think they're going to be pretty close. To what you were paying before, it just doesn't show me a breakdown billing wise on this. I mean, I could call in and see. Mhm. Well, I mean, I still have until the 22nd though to pay this 160, right? Because I thought I'd paid up the insurance. So therefore, October 22nd payment is 1666. Okay, because basically in my mind already paid the October payment because I paid 700 and something. You had a payment 729, so that was the last payment for. Last term, and then you paid the first. Renewal installment on 911, but then you paid again on 922. So you basically paid some extra into the policy, but then we processed that change. For the payroll, so that says kind of throwing things off a little bit. I think. 779. Because if we added 1446 to the policy, that's going to be adding like 100 and something a month to your bills. Mhm. But I have a question. Right where where it changed the amount. No, is that the new policy? Like is that the October policy? Is that what happened? Not not from September to September. This is a new one right October. Right. Okay. The additional payroll. Yeah. Yeah, so that was done for this new policy term. Okay, so you could have you backed it up because I you said you was going to travel you wasn't sure. Yeah, let me see if it tells me the date that they process that. Yeah, inception endorsement. So they'll process
