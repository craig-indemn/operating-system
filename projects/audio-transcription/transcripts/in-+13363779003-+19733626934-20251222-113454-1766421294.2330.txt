Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Yes, I hope you can. We have a home in France, and we're trying to pay our home insurance bill, and we're not able to get the code on our French phone to open our account to pay the bill. So I wanted we wanted to pay by credit card. How is there an English speaking line or is there some way that we can get through to pay this bill? You know, I don't know. We call them. We don't understand them. You know, we they don't. We have an English speaking line. I guess I don't know. What carrier are you guys with? Professional. A carrier, you mean? Insurance Alliance. Fr. Alliance. Fr. So we're Alliance Insurance Services, and what I'm referring to is like. Where is your home insured under? Like is Alliance a single insurance company or is that a broker? Oh, so your alliance would be. If their alliance would be, I'm sorry, maybe I got the wrong company. Then. No worries, no worries. Okay.
