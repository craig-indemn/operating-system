Sorry, if you are hold, this is Cody. May help you. Yes, Paul Lamb right here with Pineview Buildings, and I was calling in to verify insurance for a metal building installer that I was looking at installing for us. And just wanted to verify that they actually are carrying insurance, and they gave me your contact. Oh, and what do you say your name was, sir? Paul Lamb right with Pineview Buildings. Pineview Buildings. Yep. Is that in Malory? No, it's in Statesville. We're out of Statesville. Statesville. And I'm just looking to verify insurance for an installer that wants to install for us. I got you. What's the installer's name? Francisco Ponce Estrada. Give me just a second here. Okay. Doing all right today. I'm doing fine. How about yourself? Oh, not too bad. It's busy busy. Not quite as cold as yesterday. No, it's been pretty cold the last couple days, isn't it? It has been. I've heard of Pineview before. I deal with a lot of the the many. I'm up here in Carport Alley as I like to call it. Yeah. Yeah, we're we're newer in the Carport side of things. We've been doing wood wood buildings for quite a few years. I mean, we do about. The wood portable ones we do about five six thousand of those a year. Okay. We just got into the steel building and Carport stuff just about a year ago. I got you okay. How long have you all been in business doing the wood? I think it's like 13 years. Okay. Something like that. I got you. Well, yeah, are you the owner of the company or? I run the metal division. I don't know. I'm not really involved in the wood side of it. I see. The our CEO is not the easiest to get a hold of. They they, he's very busy so. Y'all have like multiple locations or is this just the one main location you have or? We have multiple. We have one here in in Statesville. We have one in South Blackville, South Carolina, and then we have one in Corsicana, Texas as well. Okay. Well, y'all. I'm sure a lot of the manufacturers around here, and I'm sure I don't know 150 installers probably. Okay. Primarily all that I do. Okay. So yeah, if you ever want to talk about your insurance or anything, I'd be happy. Your installers and stuff. I'd be happy to help anybody that. Okay. Sorry, what? I was going to say, and that's both you do about GL and Workers' Comp, right? Yeah, and and in the marine for the like tool their tools and the buildings and transit to the job sites and whatnot. If there's ever a wreck and all the materials destroyed or whatever, it you know helps the installer reimburse the manufacturer for all of their product. Yeah. Business auto as well. Business auto as well. How do you normally? So I've I've had different. I was involved with the manufacturer in Georgia previously before I got hired by Pineview. What manufacturer in Georgia? R&B metal structures. Then before okay. They're they're a smaller maybe midsize manufacturer. They're not tiny, but they're they don't come up to North Carolina. They're in Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, some North Florida. Yeah, deeper South State. They get into Mississippi and Tennessee a little bit. But it's primarily Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina, North Florida. Yeah, sure. Is where they're at. They're kind of central, kind of central Georgia, but. The when it comes to some of the the insurance there with with the Workers' Comp and stuff and what codes and stuff you run it under, we kind of I kind had a deal there that. That I I wasn't sure how everyone's doing it up here. I mean, I know how they were doing it down there, and then they kind of changed it up on us. Kind of got really expensive. And as far as the installer insurance goes. Yeah, the installer insurance had gotten very expensive. Yeah, it's well. I mean, I've been doing this for a decade basically, and installers have burned through about every insurance carrier in the country. The major one. I wondered. I wondered. They've they've been insured by every major insurance company known to man basically. So there's just not many options left for them. Unfortunately, a lot of the installers have claims, don't do their audits on time or very quickly per se. It causes a lot of issues with the insurance carriers over time. So. I wondered a little bit because the the one carrier we had down there I never had a claim. I mean, and Some of my bigger manufacturers, especially when they first were getting started or in the first several years or whatever, like they wanted to have internal crews and insure through their own, you know, their manufacturing insurance. And we did that even though I kind of advised against it. And then they got away from it because of issues, and then you know some of them have kind of revisited it just for more control and more, you know, whatever versus the external subcontracting crews. And so I've looked like, look, we got to separate this risk because you can't be having you can't have these installers having all these claims and then it going against your manufacturing insurance and that you know affects your eligibility on your own insurance with these insurance carriers and then makes your insurance a lot more expensive and harder to obtain and you got to move it to other carriers because it gets non renewed and you know this causes a lot of issues. Now obviously if they stay safe and nothing happens then it's fine but history shows eventually something's going to happen to them but it's probably going to happen to somebody at the you know at the shop at the shop or you know welding or whatever they may be doing and. It just I just won't let them basically put it back on their manufacturing insurance and bring it up again. I'm like we just can't do it. Like we took the one I did last week, we just took an LLC they had where they it's an online dealer LLC basically. Okay. We so basically I just insured it for the online sales and also installation as well. Just to separate that. Separate the two out, do you know? You don't want your manufacturing insurance affected negatively by what installers do. Yeah, especially if they're if they're not really. Yeah, you can't control them as well. Exactly. So obviously, if they're internal crews, you obviously have more control and you know you tell them where to go when they're using all of your equipment and all of your tools and all of your stuff. Never, but that doesn't mean they're less susceptible to slipping off a ladder, falling off a roof, or whatever it may be. So it's just the way I've chosen to kind of try to protect the the manufacturers from themselves. Yeah. Because a lot of them they just say, "Oh, well, we just want to do this," and I'm like, "Well, you can do that," but you're just opening up a big can of worms potentially, right? For liability and all that kind of stuff. So what is your email address? It's Paul P A U L. Dot Lambright, which is L A M. B R I G H T. Okay. At Pineview. Dot is. Okay. The I Z. I'm going to send the certificate over to you right now, Paul. I appreciate the time and conversation that was great and. Is there anything I can help you guys with or any of your installers with or anything? How many so how many installation crews are you running for the metal buildings? Ah, one, two, three, four. Basically, three, four full time, and then others as we fill in. Kind of part time here and there as needed. Yeah, kind of part time here and there as needed. We have quite a bit of building, so we weren't we've kind of started in a little slow and right now we have a million sold or so that's not installed. Million dollars worth that's not installed, but that some some of those aren't customers aren't ready. I mean we have full time work for four crews right now as as it is right now. By New Year's we'll probably have full time for six maybe seven. Okay. Who do most of your installers get their insurance through? So the the ones that we had the the crew that we had internal and then they became their own formed his own LLC and stuff. That he has he has his I'm trying to think where he has his he changed his vehicle insurance recently and I think he. Either through Progressive or State Farm on his vehicle insurance and that does include some inland marine on that as well. The the so far as the liability and the workers' comp that is through our our manufacturer's insurance currently. For that crew, then the other crew. They're currently insured through the manufacturing insurance. No, just two of them. Okay. Just two of them. Then the other the other two that we've been using some is that we just started using actually. See, I just have the COIS here. I'm seeing what the where they're actually insured from. I just have the COIS here. See if I can find them. There we go. This looks like it's through First Insurance Agency as it is represented. Gotham Insurance and Pi Insurance is. Is the other this is an installer done some for us and he's doing looks like we'll probably be having a long
