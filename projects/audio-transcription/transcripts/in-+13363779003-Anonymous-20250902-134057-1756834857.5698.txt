Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hey, may I go to Holly's? Yeah, let me see. Okay, so she is actually already out of the office. Since she is part time, it's from, she works from nine to one. Um, is there something that I can help you with? Well, she had called me on Thursday and I returned her call, but they said that she has gone for the day. And can I leave her voicemail? Yeah, I can. I can send it to her voicemail. But yeah, so I do want to go ahead and let you know she does work from nine to one o'clock every day. Every day, okay. Oh, and, she no that's Monday through Friday and then Friday she is off. Okay, okay. I just leave her voicemail. Just wait for her or I call her tomorrow. Okay, sounds good. Yeah, if you leave her voicemail now, she'll be able to see it tomorrow and give you a call back tomorrow morning. Okay, perfect. Thank you. You're welcome.
