No, but still coming in. Thank you for holding. This is Tracy. How can I help you? Tracy, this is Rita Rogers. I have a claim. In for, excessive damage in my basement. And I'm was asked to check with you all if I need to make a new claim. About this water, or can I use the old claim? Let me take a look. Is it, the water from the water heater? We don't really know whether it's water heater or some other. I've had um, a service pro to go out and check it. And it's still wet in my water in my basement. And, we that's all I know. And he, the man told me I should check with my insurance and see if I should make another claim. He can't do anything else until he has a claim number. Okay. Did he give you? So he has no idea where it's coming from. I don't think so. I really don't. He said he talked to you if he needed him to talk to you because I'm the one that met him out there to look at it. Um, he said he wouldn't mind talking to y'all if he needed to talk to him. Um, but he does need a claim number. Did know she could go off of the old claim that she had or does she need a new claim number? Well, I'm actually trying to pull up the notes. Okay. Excuse me. That's my caregiver. I'm in the hospital. Oh, I hope you're okay. Well, I'm I'm improving. Good Rita. Let me see what the notes say on this and then I will tell me what direction. Okay. Um. So on this one, the claim shows that the wood flooring in the den was damaged and damage to the walls. Yes. Okay. Have you repaired those or they're still wet from that one? No, they're still wet. We're waiting to hear if I have to make another claim. Yeah, he can use the same claim number. It looks like they sent you a payment. Hard. Did you get the check that they sent you? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, if you could actually have him give me a call. Then I can give him this claim number or direct him on what we're going to do. Okay, to whom am I speaking? It's Tracy. Tracy. Okay, Tracy. And his name is Cameron. And okay. Do you want his number? Do you want to call him and have him to call you? Um. Yeah, if you want to give me his number, I can just give him a call. Otherwise, we might play phone tag. Yeah, okay. His name is Cameron, and he's a service pro. His number is three three six. Five two nine four six zero four. He might can give you a little bit more light on the subject and then. You can go from there. Okay, I will reach out to him and see if he can tell me, and I will let you know which way we need to go. Okay. Thank you so much, Tracy. Thank you. You're welcome. You take care. I will, honey. Thank you very much. You're welcome. I'll be in touch. Okay. Bye bye.
