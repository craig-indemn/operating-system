Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Yes, ma'am. I'd like to speak to Corbin, please. Okay, he is um actually currently on the phone. Can I send it to his voicemail or I can get you someone else. No, no, no. You can call me back. We'll be fine. It is Diane Conrad. Do you want my number? Uh no, I have it here. Um. Okay, all right. That'll be fine. All right. Do you want to leave my voicemail that he that way he knows to give you a call back. Sure, sure. Yeah, that'd be fine. All right, one second.
