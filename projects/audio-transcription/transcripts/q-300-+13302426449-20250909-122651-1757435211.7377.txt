Thank you for holding this, Holly. How can I help you? Oh, this is James Marshall, and I have a my insurance with Progressive. I've got a Progressive umbrella plan that expires on ten twenty seven and it's going to be a renewal, but there's some changes because my daughter and her vehicle's still on this umbrella and she's moved to Ohio and gotten married, so I want to update this information. Okay, yeah, sure. Let me get in here. Can you verify your address for me, please? Five five seven four Walnut Park Lane, Winston Salem, North Carolina two seven one zero six. Perfect. Thank you. All right, and that's Rebecca, right? Correct. Okay, on the auto, we have the twenty one infinity and the Ford Bronco. Yep, those are there. Yep, those are those are my wife's and my car. So we need to look at. It's on the umbrella that I think she's still on. I was just looking at that. Yeah. Her jeep. Yep. Her jeep and her need to be off the umbrella. Yeah, I can definitely do that for you. Perfect. All right. Anything else we need to look at? No, I mean my renew is coming up. Any changes? I think I should do differently. Or just will things roll over? Do I need to notify you? Do we do? Do I need to do anything for my auto and home insurance? Let me look here. Auto. Okay, auto is on auto pay, so it will renew automatically. Let me check the home. See what the umbrella is. See what I've got it in. We usually send the umbrella check, a one time check. Yeah, looks like that's correct. So it'll take a couple days for the this change to get updated on the umbrella and then you should get a updated. An updated bill. Yes, exactly. Let me check real quick. Home looks like it's escrowed. Build to Wells Fargo. That's still correct. Correct. Yep, yep, yep, and that goes through. I think we get. November of twenty twenty six will be our last. I think that that'll be our last payment for the house. Okay, very good. Well, once it's paid off, if you'll just let us know, we can remove the mortgage and change the billing over to you. Perfect. All righty. All right. Let us know if you need anything else. Thanks for your help today. Thank you. Have a good day. Bye bye.
