Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hi, this is Jerry. I talked to someone yesterday about moving my vehicles to South Carolina to change my policy. They said the one called me back yesterday, and then I tried calling this morning, and I left a voicemail. Someone has called me back. Okay, let me try to get her a different way for you.
