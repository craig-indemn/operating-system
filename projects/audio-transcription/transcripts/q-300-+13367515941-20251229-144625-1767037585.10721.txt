I'm right after the lines insurance. This is Jamie. Hey, this is Kathy Bowman. I had the wind blow over my neighbor's tree and it fell on my house. Oh, no, Miss Bowman. I hope, hope everyone was okay. There was no injuries. Yeah, my son was outside. He saw it fall, but I have photos too. I'm still at work. I haven't even seen it in person yet, but it did damage to like part of my roof and the under the gutters and where the part of the house that comes off and holds the gutters. Okay, so let me just make sure I'm looking at good information here. I've got my phone system put me to Kathleen Bowman 157 Carolina Street in Mocksville, North Carolina. Yes. Okay, and then I do see your homeowner's policy is with Utica. All right, let's see. Let's see what you're just talking about business. He did come over. My neighbor did and looked at it and said he's already contacted his insurance, but that I would probably have to contact mine because it's considered active nature or something because the wind I guess blew it over. Yeah, yeah. So unfortunately, at this moment, wherever the tree lands, doesn't matter where it started from or who it belongs to. Wherever the tree lands will be the policy that will have to answer the claim. So. And of course it lands in my yard. Yeah, yeah. So it looks like there is a 1, 000 deductible on your homeowner's policy. Just so you're aware of it, I would suggest you know if if you can. You know maybe, and I'm also gathering that you're still at work and ain't seen it yet. So but I would say if you can, you can go ahead and start calling around to get some quotes to maybe cut the thing down. Okay, you know I'm going to go ahead and turn this into a claim for you. I'm going to file this with Utica. Do you want me to email you the photos? Yeah, sure, absolutely. You can send it to well, I'll push you an email and you can reply back. Okay. I've got Bowman K at Davy dot K12 dot NC dot US. Yeah, that's me. Okay, yeah, I'll push you an email. You can hang up, but if you spend any money on this whatsoever, save all the receipts, save all the pictures. I'm going to call Utica and let them know what time did this happen today? Was this earlier? Let me see what time he called me. He called me at 2:13. Okay, so we'll say 2 o'clock time of loss. And then I contacted my neighbors. Yeah, in the now, I wouldn't engage in this conversation with your neighbor, but just so you know, right, if if this was a negligent thing where that tree was dead and should have been taken care of or something. And then it failed. The insurance companies they do typically hold the right to subrogate against the neighbor for not taking the tree down. That's a fancy word for saying they'll sue that guy to get their money back once they pay for all your damages. I would not engage in that conversation with your neighbor. I'm just telling you because I've seen that happen. But I'm going to go ahead and call this in to Utica for you. Three six four zero eight seven nine four zero is the number that I have on here for you. Sounds like email is good. Utica, I'm legally I'm supposed to tell you 24 to 48 hours for them to reach out to you. Okay, they try to get out as quickly as they can. Well, and I am getting ready to call Duke Power because one of the lines that's on there is actually my power line coming into my house. Oh boy, oh man, that stinks. So I need them to come out and get it off the power line. Yeah, yeah, that that that might be the first stop on the train there. Yeah, I'm getting ready to call them after you. Yeah, Miss Bowman, I do wish you luck with all this. I'm glad nobody was hurt. But if you need anything, does it matter who I call to get it removed? Or do I call for roof estimates? No, if there's somebody that you have used in the past, if you like, you could call them and just get some estimates. I would probably, if this were provided that there's nothing like. You know structurally, if your house is livable, I guess would be the way I would say it. I believe so. I don't, I don't know. As far as I know, it's just that one little corner it took off. Yeah, so in that case, like
