Good morning. Oh, good morning, Karen. Yes. Hey, this is Mark at Cyber Gear. I'm good. How about you? I'm good. I was just following up on your laptop to see if we found a way to get it to Mount Airy yet. We haven't. I was able to contact my supervisor, but she said that one of our other agents that working on Airy should come by next week, and that way they'll just go ahead and try to take it up there. Perfect. All right. Well, that's all I needed. Alrighty, thank you so much for checking in. Thank you so much. You have a good day.
