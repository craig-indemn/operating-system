Hello. Hey there, Phyllis. It's Jeremy. Hi, I appreciate you calling me back. So you were you were in the process of telling me how much it would be per month, correct? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. And it is four hundred fifty three dollars and eleven cents. Okay, so yearly we're talking. Around thirty seven. Yeah. Fifty four. Okay. That's a. Not really, but about six hundred dollars savings from what we are paying. I was I was hoping for something better. Is the coverage the same basically? Oh yes, ma'am. Yeah, the coverage is the same. You've got actually you've got equipment. Let's see, we've got mechanical breakdown is included. Service line coverage is included. What service line coverage means is from the street to your home, like out there if Duke Power came out had to work on your line or do something. That you had to call them for to get a fix. They'll do the work, but they would normally charge you. But this covers up to ten thousand dollars that. So it would be paid for by your insurance policy. Okay, so that would be with Cincinnati. Is that what you said? Hello. Hello. Hello. You'll be better now, Phyllis. Yes, yes, uh huh. Okay. Okay, so that was with Cincinnati, right? Yes, ma'am. It sure is. Okay, well I appreciate it and thank you so much. We are going to get. We have one other estimate. We're going to get a couple more before we make a decision. But I really. It it is a little bit of savings, but six. I really was hoping for more than six hundred. You know savings because it just. And the overall scheme of things, it's not as much as I thought it would be. And but I do appreciate you talking with us.
