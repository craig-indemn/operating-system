Hello, this is Heather. Hi, Heather. This is Abby Hayden. How are you? Hey Abby, good. How's it going? Good. First of all, thank you for the holiday card. I got one from Alliance, so I figured that we. Yes. Thank you. I appreciate that. Hey, I'm calling because something on my auto owners the auto draft. It doesn't seem to be drafting ever since I paid the deposit like two months ago. Okay. When I happened to just go into the portal the other day to look, it said I was negative like eleven cents. I went in and paid it, but like it doesn't seem that like my auto draft is drafting. But when I go in, like right now I'm in it. Wait a second. It says automatic payments are on, no payment due because I paid that past due eleven cents. But I don't know why that would be though eleven cents. Yeah, and it says that you're current plan your account will be paid on the 17th. But nothing's been drafted this month for the 17th. Okay. Yeah, let me take a look at that from my end and see what um. Let's see if we can make sense of all this. So. Okay. Are you ready for the holidays, girl? I am still ready. Yeah. I'm one of my best friends is flying in on the 28th and I'll pick her up and. And then we're gonna head to Savannah for about three or four days to do the new year's there so I'm really. Oh fun that yes yeah. What about you? Are you excited? Ready for the break? Yeah, kind of. I've had a lot going on, Abby, since we last spoke. So yeah, just you know, family things, parents getting older stuff like that. You know. That's tough. My dad's like four hours away, so it's been yeah it's still tough. I'm so sorry. Well, I will definitely be praying for you. I'll keep you in my thoughts. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I'm showing zero due. Let's see. Because when I go to like the payment history, yeah. It shows that my last payment was back in October. Before the policy even started, I guess I had to put like a deposit down because the policy technically didn't start until the month after that. But I went ahead and paid it. And so I technically not really had anything auto draft at all since starting this policy. Like I went in manually and paid the 10528 and then. I look at the history, you'll see again on December 20th I paid that eleven cents. But it just doesn't seem like anything's truly drafting from the account when it says it is set up on auto draft. Um and I had a message from underwriting also so I'm kind of glad you called but I mean I had responded back to them. Um, your roof you you're not sure if whether it was a total replacement a complete replacement because this was a new purchase correct. When you bought the home, they didn't indicate. Yeah, but you you think it was like replaced. I think I know we had that conversation. Yeah, the back part of the house. Yeah. Added on so because it was an addition of the home obviously it needed a roof right. So they a back wing of the house and then back wing has the new roof. Okay, yes. But you didn't you that was previously done before you purchased it so there's no like yeah we can't. Provide proof of that. I think that's what they were asking because I did mention that to them whenever we wrote the policy. Um and then you know I had to call about getting approval because of the. The water damage and all that stuff, and just to confirm again everything was repaired. You're good on that. Did you ever did you install a? Got water shut off valve that we talked about. No, I didn't. Okay, no it's fine. You don't have to. No, yeah, yeah, we got approval. You know because we went with auto owners Cincinnati was the one that we were looking at but. You know they would require that so no everything's good as far as the policy goes just one I know they had reached out to me last week. Um. And my I tell my dad had a stroke so I have been like yeah I've been there for like a week and a half. He lives in North Myrtle Beach but um. You know we're getting there but um I know they had reached out and I just responded back to them. So because I know we had that conversation. Yeah, just when I bought the house, yeah it didn't already done right. Um. So I don't have any documentation of. When it's all completed. Yeah, yeah that's Yeah, and the state of North Carolina, well, I'm here. Yeah, and all North Carolina flood is on a separate policy. Like you can't add it to your homeowners insurance. You can have a separate policy if you want to take flood insurance out. Now flood is not like what you what you recently had with the water damage. Yeah, that's that's just that's. Yeah, that that water damage is filed under your homeowners where. Like that was from a leak inside, right? Like the plumbing, something happened with all that. Or say if there was a a hurricane or. A tornado or wind storm, you know, and the leaking it's your home is flooded through your roof. Say your roof was damaged from the storm. And water came in that way, like from downpour rain, but it would have to come in through a window or the roof. Um, that's covered under your homeowners insurance. So just keep in mind, like when you think of flood insurance, that's going to be from rising water outside of your home due to like downpours, torrential rains. That are rising, or say if you live near a creek or a lake and it floods, and so the water is going to seep in through your home from the outside and rise. Okay, does that make sense? That's going to be flood insurance. If it's if it's coming in from like either your roof, like the the say the storm blew part of your roof off the shingles. Water is coming in that way, or if if a tree hits the window and breaks the window and there's rain rainwater coming in through the window or roof, then that would be covered under homeowners. But if it's a flood, and that means like from rising water from the outside coming into your home from the ground up. Okay. Thank you for clarifying. So that makes sense. So there is my home is still covered if there were any kind of plumbing leaks or anything like that in the future. Absolutely. Yes. I'm gonna pray God there's not because I am not filing a claim for like. Oh gosh, I know. I got like manifesting no claims, no claims. Right. Yeah. The other question I just had, I just wanted to understand what it meant. It says premium above rate bureau premium. I and then it talks about the premium based upon the approved rates in North Carolina. Would be 1512. Our premium is 27. 87. Like I mean, it is what it is. I'm just trying to understand what that means. Right. Yeah. So in the state of North Carolina again, you know each state has a rating. Um, and this is like from the North Carolina Bureau Insurance Commissioners. So if it's a certain percentage, then. They some some carriers wouldn't be able to write it because it didn't meet the the North Carolina Rate Bureau. Okay. Rating so yours is over, so you're good there. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, there's some that will deny it because it's not rating according to the North Carolina Rate Bureau. Got it. Okay, perfect. That helps me understand. Okay, perfect. Well, that is all I needed. I will get you a screenshot and an email. Yeah. Boxy thing. Okay. Um and then you still have my email, don't you, Abby? I do. Yes, I do. Okay. And then if for some reason like. First second week of January, if it still hasn't auto drafted, I'll shoot you an email. No. Yeah. On it because last month. Like it didn't draft, and then I was like, "Okay," and then this month I was like, "You know, I'm keeping the money in. " Yeah. I'm not seeing it draft, so. So when we bound the original policy, you know we have to take a down payment at that time, and we bound it pretty early. Yeah. So ahead of ahead of time, so it went ahead and drafted. So then you wouldn't have a draft in November, but. I still don't understand that eleven. Yeah, I don't know. I've never seen that before. But. Well, I just went another day. I was like, "Well, let me go in and check." Gosh. Two eleven cents. I was like, "Oh well, okay." Yeah, right. Um. Okay, yeah. So and I like I said, it looks like it's scheduled to draft again, but it's always a good idea is to keep up with that, you know, just to make sure. But everything looks good, and if you send me over that screenshot, I'll get that cleared for you. But hopefully they can go in and get that. Yeah, I don't see anything like there's no pending cancellation. There's no nothing needed Yeah and if you ever need like a quote on flood insurance I'll be glad to get you that too you know if that's something that you think you might need some people take it out here some people after Hohen hurricane Hohen we had of course everybody was calling in very concerned because you wouldn't typically have a flood up there in the mountains right but they did so there was unfortunately a lot of people wasn't covered because they never thought I'm not in a flood zone you know this isn't a flood area so yeah I've had a lot of people call since then just wanting to take out flood insurance but most of time you'll take it out like if you're near the coast or you know if if you're in a flood zone but yeah I mean if you think about it and it's I would tell you it's probably for you I would think it would be around five five or six hundred dollars for a year okay that's not yeah just to give you an idea yeah and and just remember I be too we do write all lines of insurance so you know you need anything health insurance life insurance flood business we do it all okay so don't ever hesitate to reach out and I'll be more than happy to get you a quote and like with auto owners you're in a good carrier because they we could we could potentially bundle everything with them they write all lines too okay perfect yeah I literally just added that I'm such like a type A on my what I'm going to be doing I know girl that's yours so you're wonderful yeah 2027 goals and I have it here and I just added flood insurance next year so that is now on there going into 2027 so perfect well thank you so much now you haven't what year is your home what year was that built oh 1860 what I did hold did you do a water update I know you had the the clean and stuff with the water was that no that was that from like the old pipe or that was because the upstairs bathroom the upstairs plumbing goes exterior where the downstairs plumbing is interior and I didn't know that they didn't tell me that when I bought the house right when it was freezing and I was dripping the faucets like you're supposed to do to be preventative I was dripping the faucets downstairs and I dripped the faucets upstairs but I didn't realize I didn't know that the upstairs piping went exterior so dripping that goes exterior you're just freezing the pipe right and so that was the issue so now I mean obviously I didn't rewire plumbing to go inside I just damage corrected and now I know and if I ever sell this house I will be a thoughtful owner unless the future buyers know like hey upstairs the plumbing goes exterior so please don't but nobody told me so right now did you do any other updates after you moved in like wiring like electrical or plumbing or any other piping just on your own without the clean no no it's been it's been all all of that's been done previously so I really haven't had to do any updates I mean the central heat we all put in brand new windows were put in all oh wow let's put it yeah I felt really blessed with the only thing I'm having to change out is like old lady wallpaper you know and I don't well yeah yeah so I just purchased the home that girl whenever I tell you it's been like a a roller coaster I've been on this emotional roller coaster um I just bought this home well I haven't got it I closed on the 12th of January which is my birthday happy birthday to me right but then in the middle of all this um my dad like I said he had a stroke and it's been a lot so between like family matters trying to juggle work and purchase a home it's been a little chaotic chaotic um but yeah it's an older home too so I'm trying to I'm stressing out a little bit about that like what all I just got the inspection done last week um so I'm going through that and it's overwhelming I'm like oh my god you know so um the home has been updated somewhat but it still has like a lot of the old like cast iron pipes you know underneath the home for the drainage and stuff like that but I mean everything is working it's just you know how long is it going to last you know like should I start trying to replace everything now or you know but I think I'm going to because I would rather be proactive than to wait until something happens and then I'm falling a claim right so right right absolutely well one thing I've learned there I've learned with whole over homes and I just like feedback from other people who have older homes like that I was asking like what do you do right they were just like you want to make sure because it's an over home it's structurally built with like older materials and older right and they were like a if it's not broke yet try don't fix it because then you're going in and you're like gutting things that are built so This one was built in sixty five but um you know I keep hearing prior to seventy a lot of homes had the asbestos and then lead paint and blah blah blah so and I'm wanting to start like knocking some walls down but that's what worries me is the asbestos right you know is there any in there um the lead you know and that's where you were saying I just I need to hire someone that's experienced with this because they'll know how to contain it because they said you know with the asbestos you don't want to disturb it or the lead yeah but I definitely want to knock some walls down in there make it all open but I'm like it terrifies me the thing is it's asbestos in there or you know is yeah it's a wall um there is I reached out to a couple of folks and everyone has been so friendly the North Carolina like preservation society where they like preserve old historical homes and they have an email on their website and I reached out several times because at one point I thought I wanted to do oh gosh I'm blanking on the type of roof cedar shake I thought I wanted to do that because it would just complement a home then I found out how expensive it was I was like never mind oh yeah yeah but I reached out to them about you know just um historical roofing that would complement a home and then if they hire people that just you know specialized in the historical type preservation work and they'll give you contractors and folks that like specialize in historical homes so definitely reach out to them because they've always been so helpful when I reached out letting them know like you know I live in an 1800s home who has expertise and they've always given me contact information to reach out to right yeah yeah and lucky for you too like you're like you said yours was you know they had already went in and updated the electrical new windows things like that so that's great unfortunately for me this was um the so mine was an option so I did on it oh yeah but and the good thing is like all the everything was in a state and all everything that was auctioned went to a Davy County foundation that's in a scholarship so all the money's proceeds go to the students there in Davy County like for scholarship fund which made me feel really good right but it was an older couple they were the original owners of the home they had it built in sixty five they only had one son and he passed away early in life like in twenty I think it was twenty seven so at that time him and the wife decided when something happened to them they would they would auction everything off all the it would just be in a state and everything would be auctioned and be put in that scholarship foundation it's called the Desmond scholarship foundation so yeah um but I'm about doing something like that like my will is that I'll say if something happens I'm not married and I don't have children so mine um yeah unless the Lord changes that later but if something were to happen to me tomorrow the way I have mindset of is mine it just would be donated to the North Carolina historical society yeah that's great yeah yeah that's the idea I kind of like that idea better yeah it just it makes me feel good but um and then but the only thing about it the downside is the the owners have both passed the wife went first like a couple years ago and then the the man he just passed away like three months ago so there's no way to tell what all they usually updated you know whatever it's a lot of things it's like you know did they do this or I mean I did have an inspection done but again a lot of there's there's things that they can tell me and then there's things that they don't even really know like you know some things were so old mighty um it has an oil furnace or old room yeah um he was trying to determine the date on that and then the even the HVAC unit um the AC he's he's like it's so old like the the tag um like a plate I guess with like the serial number he couldn't even see it so the water heater is good it's fairly new but there's just some things it's like you know he couldn't really tell so which tells me it probably needs to be replaced soon yeah yeah but yeah that's just the only thing like where you you know you were able to talk to the sellers that um probably updated most of that stuff before you know before you purchased it and yeah I know they were kind of had like a photo album of like pictures and just so that you could always see where piping ran or right just so that and I thought I was crazy I have this photo album of photos from like 1993 when they were adding on the kitchen and all of that but at least I know like if something happens I can share that photo album with right that's great yeah um but wow I was grateful for that but they still didn't tell me about your piping that's the one thing they didn't tell me about so probably flip their mind it probably
