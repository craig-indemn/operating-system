Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hi there. Um, I was just uh wondering if I can get some information about my account that everything is up to date and paid for. Yeah, let me take a look. Uh, can you verify your address for me, please? Yes, um, I'm not sure if the new address is on there. Uh, 5701 Old Lexington Road. Is that the new one? Yes. Okay, perfect. That's what we got. All right, and it looks like you're on auto pay. Um, the last payment that was made, or that they drafted was for 474 with four cents. And that was drafted on the ninth. So you're all paid up. Um, the next amount due is not until February 11th. And like I said, you're on auto pay, so it'll automatically draft. Okay. All right then. Um, so I do have another question. Well, you guys are the insurance company. Okay, so um, my dad and I received um some messages supposedly about. Um, having a speeding ticket or something like that. None of us have received any tickets. In the past year, from 2025, and then this January, you think it could be just like stammers or something. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Um, because either ways we wouldn't send that out. Yeah, because there's something about it was gonna inform the insurance company and um something about the plates being removed and stuff. So I just want to make sure everything is good. Yeah, no, you're you're all good. Okay, just regard that. Okay, no problem. All right, I appreciate you. You're welcome. Have a good one. Thank you too. Have a.
