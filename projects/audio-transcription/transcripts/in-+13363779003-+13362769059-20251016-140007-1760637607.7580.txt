Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Um yes, good afternoon. I was calling to see if you are able to help me with, um, checking how much I'm supposed to pay a month because I was charged less than what usually um charged. Okay. What name is the policy in? It's Darling Vigil. It's an auto policy with National General. Yeah. Okay. Looks like. Looks like the renewal amount went down. Let's see here. I mean I'm not complaining but I just wanted to know if everything's is on on track you know. Yes. Well let me get you over to an agent just so they can answer that just one moment. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome.
