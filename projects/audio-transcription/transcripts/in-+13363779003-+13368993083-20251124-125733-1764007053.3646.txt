Thank you so much for calling Alliance Insurance. Hi, I have a quick question. I got an email yesterday saying that I registered with you guys and have my account now, and I didn't do that. So I was wondering if you can look into that for me. Okay, let me get one of the agents and see what is going on with that because we should not be sending information to people that don't have a policy with us. Give me one second. Okay. All right, thank you.
