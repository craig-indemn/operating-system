Thank you for calling Johnson Johnson. This is Robin, how may direct your call. Hi there, Robin. I work with an agency in North Carolina, and I need some help with a quote we have built and to get it revised. All right, one moment. Thank you. And this is personal lines. Yes, ma'am. All right, and it's in North Carolina. One moment. Welcome to Johnson and Johnson. We are an independent wholesale broker. Underwriting. This is Jen. Hi there, Jen. My name is Jeremy Palmer. I'm with Alliance Insurance Services in North Carolina. How are you doing today? I'm doing all right. How are you doing? I am well up to this point. It's pretty weather for the most part. It's been pretty nice. Awesome. What's going on? What can I help you with today? I've got a quote that our flood specialist had built for me to present, and she is out of the office for the next week or so, and I need the quote updated slightly. And was wondering could you help me with that. Gotcha. Unfortunately, I would need to get you over to the flood team. Yes, ma'am. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm on the homeowner side. So let me shoot you over to flood. Yes, ma'am. See if someone can help. Okay. Thank you for your help, ma'am. I truly appreciate it. Absolutely. Let's see. Yep, here they come. Thank you. Welcome to Johnson and Johnson. Good afternoon, Johnson and Johnson. This is Lynn. Hi there, Lynn. This is Jeremy. I'm coming from North Carolina with Alliance Insurance Services. I hope you're doing well today. I am Jeremy. Thank you so much. I hope the same for you. It is so far yes ma'am. We are halfway through the week on a short week. So I guess that's a good thing right? Yes, it sure is. So our flood specialist is out for the next week, and she had prepared a quote for me that I need to have very slightly revised. And was wondering could you help me with that. Yes, what is the quote number? Three one three two seven four eight one. And while that's pulling up for me, what type of quote is this? Uh, so this is for flood. And that's all that I. Let's see on the quote here. It's a residential primary flood policy. Is what it is. It is just still thinking for me here. That's okay. That's not a problem at all. Is that for Raheem? Yes, it is. Absolutely. Let's see. So let's edit this quote. And this is for residential primary flood. Yes, ma'am. That is. And what is the new desired effective date? The desired effective date will be the same. I think. Well, no, it's going to be set for probably. Um, it's the 22nd, right? And that what we have in place. I hope. This is quoted with a September 2nd effective date, which is passed. Yeah, okay. So we would make it. I'm trying to understand how to do this. If we bind it prior to their closing date, does that eliminate the seven day wait? For a closing, there is no seven day wait. So whatever day they're closing, we can have as the effective date on the coverage. Excellent. So that'll be September 22nd. Okay, and let's see here. I presume that the coverage amount is 377, 000. Is that accurate? When you get to that screen, of course. Absolutely. Let's see. We have this as 1785 Mallard Drive in Kernersville. Yes, ma'am. That is correct. Perfect mailing address is going to match the property address. Any prior flood losses at this location? No, ma'am. And we have this as frame construction built in 2024. How many stories? The previous person put zero. Okay, so this is where I need to update. First of all, the year built is actually this year 2025. Is it completed construction? Yes, it is. Okay. And two stories. No basement. And square footage. Is 2345. It's going to be their primary home. Yes, ma'am. It is. And is the building elevated with a crawl space or an enclosure? No, ma'am. Slab. Slab on grade or slab on fill. Slab on fill. Perfect and still a flood zone X. Yes, ma'am. And it was built to have an attached garage. Yes. Just one family in the building. Yes, ma'am. Perfect and the cost to build the structure, please. Was. I got my note right here. Cost to build the structure.
