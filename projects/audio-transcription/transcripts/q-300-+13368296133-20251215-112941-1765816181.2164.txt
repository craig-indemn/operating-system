Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hey Brandi, this is Shelly Kirkland. I'm calling. I guess because my renewal was up and somebody called me, but they had to call me back. I don't know if it was you because I was working and then they called me back today, but I was in the hospital. But I guess I need to go over my renewal stuff and then I am in the process of moving to a new place, so I need to go over rental insurance, which I've never had in my life. This is my work clothes. They need to go with the other work clothes that are in the closet. Okay, so looks like you already talked to Heather about your renewal stuff and she was reaching back out to get that other policy for you. Give me one second. I haven't signed the lease yet. I'm signing it hopefully today or tomorrow. But I don't know how rental insurance works. So rental insurance is going to cover your personal belongings in the place up to a certain amount, and then it's also going to provide liability, which most apartment complexes or landlords require you to have. The minimum that we do is 500, 000 and that is basically just to protect you even more. Okay. Most of the time they only require 100, 000 but that's really not going to cover much at all and then you would have to pay the rest out of pocket. If something were to happen to the place like if you had like a small fire in the kitchen or something or maybe water damage. Right and I was found negligent. Yep. So let me see. I know normally rental insurance is cheap though, correct. Yes, it is. It's not like a homeowner's policy. I need that dryer with all the clothes in the washer. Okay, give me one second because I'm trying to find the quote that she has. I'm going to put you on a brief hold, okay. Yeah, I didn't go over anything with the rental though, so I don't know. Yeah, I think she was reaching out to go over possibly. Oh, that's fine. My daughter's doctor is calling. So if you put me on hold, I'll put you on hold and then we'll switch back. I didn't hang up though, okay. Okay, that's fine. All right, right. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance Services. We appreciate your patience and we will be with you shortly.
