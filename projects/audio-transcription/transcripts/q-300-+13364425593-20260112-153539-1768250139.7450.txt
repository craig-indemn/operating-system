Thank you, Holy Miss Gary. Hi Gary, this is Renee from Renee Knight. We got a new vehicle policy with y'all, and they said they were going to contact my old company, and my company said they never received anything, and I'm still getting billed from them. Okay, now what did we do for you, Renee? What will we suggest to do for you? I guess I asked them if they were going to call them and cancel our policy with the other company, and they said yes, and that's not happened, so I'm confused. What the old company that you had were were you with us with that company? No, I was with Burton and Company in Hillsville, and then I came to your company to get cheaper rates. They got everything set up, and I paid the whole year in full, and I specifically asked them if they were going to take care of canceling. With my company, and they said yes, and nothing was ever done, and now I'm getting billed. For this, I guess it'd be the third month now. That that is not a normal process that we do. I don't know who you spoke with before, but we don't ever and unless that policy is issued within our agency, the old policy. We would not have the authority to cancel that policy for you. That's interesting. Okay, because the lady that was at the first desk is the one I talked to. I came in and paid paid in in full. It was right before Thanksgiving, and I said, "Now are you going to take care of contacting my company?" And she texted somebody and she said, "Yes, we'll take care of all of that." Okay, what spell your last name for me? K N I G H T. Okay, and is that policy in your name by itself or you as your husband's name? It is just in my name, but I'm wondering why they didn't put my husband's name in on it as well. I mean, he's listed as a driver. His name is Kenneth Knight. Okay. I'm going to do a little research on this myself to see what might have happened on that and where you got the information from. Okay. What is that phone number for you? Three three six four four two five five nine three. Five five nine three. If there's any way that we can do it for you, we will make sure that that gets completed. But if not, I will call you back and you will have to request that cancellation through the other company. Who who was the other company? Burton and Associates in Hillsville. In the the specific company that you were insured with, do you know who that was? Auto Auto Owners. Got you. Do you need a policy number or account number? I can take it. Okay, it's zero. Available to you. I do. It's zero one seven. Nine eight four three zero seven. Three zero seven. Okay. Let me do a little research on it, Renee, and see if I can find out what's going on with it, and I'll call you back and let you know. Okay. All right, sounds great. Thank you. Thank you. Uh huh. Bye.
