Sorry for your hold. This is Cody. I help you. Hey Cody's Dallas. Hey Dallas, how are you sir? Hey good good, how are you man? Ah, not too bad. I can help you. Hey man, I was, well you know I have a business policy with you guys. Yes sir. And right now I'm out of town. Vacation and they need a, it's going to be a rental, for the week. Okay, for a lift or something. No, this is going to be for a car. Oh, you're renting a vehicle. Yes, and I was just wondering if I was able to add that to the policy or not. Um, what did what is the company asking for? Who are you renting it from? Like enterprise or somebody like that. Ah, let's see. One second. Did they give you any sort of like paperwork on what they need to be shown on a certificate or something like that? Um, I guess they just are requiring like the car to be on the policy. It's just going to be rented for one day. Oh, okay. I mean, your policy. I mean, are they asking for some sort of proof? I'm assuming. Yeah, I guess that's what they're asking for. Who are you renting it from? Ah, let it hold on. One second. Manza Exotics. Manza Exotics. Yeah. Okay, are they asking for anything in particular in regards to coverage or? I mean, your your policy covers rented vehicles. So what are they asking for exactly? Yes, but it's it's I'm out of town. I'm in California and I want to rent a sports car. Oh, yes. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, that's for work. No, no, no, no. This this that's what I'm asking. No, no, no, no. Yeah, this policy is definitely not going to cover anything like that. No, that would be something that maybe your personal auto policy might cover. Okay, but your commercial is not going to cover a rental recreational vehicle. Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Yeah. Yeah, that was just my question. Yeah. Yeah, you you could contact your personal auto company and see if they can give coverage for that. There might be restrictions if it's a sports car. I mean, we talking like a super car or something like that type of rental or what. Yeah. Um, and I don't know if you'd probably I doubt that they would cover it either to be honest since that's what it is. Okay. I mean, you would definitely need to talk with them about it first. But your commercial policy is only going to cover. Um, you know vehicles used in. For the business, business right. Awesome. All right, Cody. That was just my question, man. Yeah, no problem, else. Okay, thank you, man. You sir, bye.
