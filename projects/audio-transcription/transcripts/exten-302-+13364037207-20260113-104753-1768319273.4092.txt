Or you know I can't find the new policy with the breakdown of the prices. Okay. Yes. So the renewal deck page. Yes, I can't find it. It's. I don't think you guys mailed it to me. I think I got it in an email. Now I can't find it. Um. So how can and I'm on um I am on this alliance website. I'm logged in. I see um auto, but it doesn't open up a deck page or anything unless I'm doing something wrong. So you have not the glove box. Yes. Okay. I'm not sure if it's uploaded up there or not, but I can definitely pull it from the carrier site and email it over to you. Okay. Yeah, because like I said, I don't know why I can't find it now, but I can't find it. But I want to make some. I want to talk to someone about making some changes. Okay. Give me one second. Hold on. And what's a good email address for you? So let me go ahead and get the sent over to you. That way we can take a look at it. Okay, Lynn at Saponi Industries dot com. Give me one second. I'll get the email over to you. Okay. Send it to you right now. Give me one second. Okay. Just email it to you. Okay. There we go. Got it. Open it. Okay. Okay. On the um. Okay, the Lexus LX460. I think that's liability. No. Okay. So. Okay, all right. The G the Lexus GX470 is liability only. Okay. Um. Okay, on the. It's got the 2006. I'm sorry. Yes, 2006. Correct. Yeah. Okay. On the bodily injury property damage. That's it's got 500, 000 on the 2010 Lexus. Correct. It's combined. Yes, single limit 500, 000. Okay. Can we not lower that down to 300, 000? Yeah, we can look into that. Do the 100 300. Okay, and what would that? How would that lower it? Um. I would not know until I run it through the rating system. And I would want to do that. I would want to do that on Honda as well. So the 2010 Lexus and the 2007. Yeah, the 2010 Lexus and the 2007 Honda. Okay. Well, what about okay and all three of them have the same coverages. Are we changing all three? Yeah, let's let's take a look at that. Okay. And I'll get I can get it quoted before we submit it so that way you can take a look to see what the changes would be. Okay. When when will I get this? I can get you today. Um. I just have to give me a little bit after lunch. Will that work? That will work. Yes. Okay. So I'll get it quoted to where we will change those coverages in all three. To that, are there any other changes you wanted to take a look at or just start with that to kind of see. Uh, let me see. I'm trying to look to see if there's anything else. I don't think there's anything else because everything else is thousand there, thousand there. The deductibles are thousands. The collision is 500. Um, same on the Honda. Not right. Yes, the Honda. And then like I said, I believe if I'm looking at it right, the Lexus GX470 that's that's liability only, right? Correct. Yes. Um. And then the other two have a collision and. Um comprehensive and you have 100 for your comprehensive deductible and 500 for your collision. Would that make a huge difference in the premiums? Honestly, no. It won't. It could be like a 5 to 10 difference. The only thing I'd advise is if we do up it, just make sure that whatever we bump it up to. That anything
