Hello, this is Jeff Edmonds. Can I help you? Oh, Jeff, this is Lisa Macy with Main Street, on the commercial line side. Yeah. Hey, how are you doing? I'm doing fine. Hope you are. Yes, yes. Are you still sitting in the front? Well, I am currently, but I'm not in Winston Salem normally. I'm usually in Mount Airy, and this is Rick's extension. Are you trying to reach him? Yes, but that's okay. What I'm trying to do is, you know, so we Main Street America, our company, you know, has already started leaving North Carolina for personal lines, but we're growing in the small commercial line space. So no personal, yeah. So I wanted to try to schedule. Do you do? Do you do small commercial lines, Jeff? We do, and you would probably be better to speak with Rick about scheduling. He sort of is it. Call me back. Well, he's in Main Street. He's in the office all day on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and half day Thursdays, and out entirely on Friday, which is why I'm sitting at his desk right now. So. And you got the call. I got the call. So my advice would be to I will be glad to leave him a note that you called, and I would follow up with an email to him because he is actually. Yeah, he quoted. Well, he just what Jeff? He quoted a few after I was in there, but I didn't. I didn't hear back. Like I didn't know if he needed credit on anything or whatnot. So, so but then he didn't quote anymore. So I was like, "Well, I want to see it." He did mention Main Street as a matter of fact being a a small commercial carrier that he could among other companies that we have not done a whole lot with recently. And you guys did come up in our weekly meeting on Wednesday. If that means anything to you, so yep, he did bring you guys up. You know what Jeff? So you just made my day. Well, I'm glad. Yeah, because because you know we we're all fighting out there, right? Because you got other companies. And so we're all trying to fill what you need. So I knew you guys were doing small business, and I sit back and I look at some of our bots that will pay 25 commission and they're cheap. And I'm like, I wonder what Rick quoted that didn't work out because the bot is far less expensive. I mean, it's like 25 commission Angie. So. It is so. I need to put him. I will send an email. Does he have to authorize those or do you want me to send? A few like I just I have an opening like Tuesday now, but I tried him too. We got it all the way. Yeah. Well, he's been out a lot. He's been out a little bit the last couple of weeks as well. So I would like I said I'll be glad to leave him a note at his desk that he'll see on Monday. And I would follow up with an email to him. Do you have his email address? Well, yeah, I can let me write it down again just to make sure I had it right. Sure, it's Rick R I C K at my M Y Alliance A L L I A N C E Insurance. I have yes, I have it right here. Y'all fill out the whole thing. Yep, that's right. So is there ever a time? One more question, and I'll hurry. I know Fridays are crazy, but Jeff, is there ever a time when you you mentioned a Wednesday meeting? Is there a time when y'all like allow a rep to talk for like 20 minutes so y'all ask questions or we just quote? That's exactly what we do from time to time, and Rick handles all that. He does all that scheduling, and so that that would be something you would want to bring up with him because what we do every Wednesday we have a sales meeting that takes I don't know anywhere from 15 to 25 30 minutes depending on what we get into and then typically after that marketing reps can have the floor for the amount of time you were talking about so you would want to you'd want to bring that up with Rick. Very good, and just so you know too sometimes when whenever agencies do this and they they like to have the rep come in, I can like wait in an area for anything you're covering personally, you know, and then you can let me know when to come, but I will send him an email. Yep, and I'll just shoot out some potential Wednesdays. Sounds good. That would be great. Good talking to you, Lisa. Thank you
