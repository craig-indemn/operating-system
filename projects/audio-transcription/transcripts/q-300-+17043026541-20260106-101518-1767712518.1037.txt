Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Ah, yes, my name is Mary Nichols, and I was wondering if you could help me with why my insurance has increased for the month of January. Okay, and Mary, can you verify your mailing address for me, please? Yes, it's eight six five River Hill Road. All right, so it looks like we have your auto policy with Travelers. Um, you did have a renewal, um, for January starting on the nineteenth. Um, it did increase. I'll have to look into it to see why it increased. Um, but let me just confirm what I do have um on the policy right now. It's a 2006 Ford Explorer and it is liability only. Is that correct? Yeah, that's correct. That's why I wondered why it was so high. Okay, um, well, and it'll take me a minute to get into Travelers and look and see why. Well, can you call me? Can you, oh, can you call me right back? Yes, I can call you back before the end of the day. Oh, because if it's not like an easy thing for me to just look at the policy and find why it increased, then I have to reach out to Travelers. Okay, okay, that's fine. Um, I will tell you that from three o'clock till about four or four thirty, I'm going for an MRI. I won't be able to answer my phone at that point in time. But if you can get back with me before then, that would be great. Okay, I'll do my best. Okay, oh, thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Bye.
