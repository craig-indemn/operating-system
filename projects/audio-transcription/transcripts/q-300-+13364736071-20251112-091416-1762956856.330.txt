Thanks for holding. I just Holly, how can I help you? Hi, tell me your name again. Holly. Molly. Holly with an H. Holly. Holly, hi. I go to Greg. I've always worked with Morris, so I'm going to miss her. I'm sad that she's not there anymore. Is she okay? Is she okay physically? As far as I know, yes. Okay, good, good. All right, Holly. My home up in Surrey is three years old, so I need you to pull up that policy. It's due next month. I just got the bill on that. Do you need something else? If you just verify your address, going. The address and the policy is one five two triple B, as in Brown Lane, Mount Airy. Got it. Okay, I'm getting it pulled up. What can I do? All right, what we need to look at. All right, well, we you know, I've had it with you guys. I think three years and it went from under 400 to over a thousand. So we need to we need to look at that. So to make some adjustments. I think there's a thousand dollar deductible on that. You want to look at increasing it. Yes, to 2500. Also, looks like on the renewal the dwelling coverage is increasing about 36, 000. So your replacement cost will be 345. Is that just you know I'm just so surprised that everything's going up so much especially in the last two years when it was originally. Around around 400 dollars. So, and I guess that's just inflation, right? I guess most insurance companies are doing that. Yeah, and I can go in here and we can review that replacement cost estimator. Make sure everything. Okay, do that, and I tell you what I really want to look at is. I'm on my phone and my phone is awful small print, so I'm going to see if I can. Read it. The average cost of. Hold on. Personal property. Now that it's let's say that the house come on fire and it burned everything inside. That's what that is, right? Personal property. Yep, all your personal belongings. Anything you can pick up and take with you. Okay, so I think it's like it. What is that percentage? 70 is that normal? It is. We can go down to 50. Yeah, that's what I want to do. I was talking to my wife. Think about it. So whatever the dwelling is now. So what is it now in this policy? 345. All right. Now think about that. 345 divided by two. That's 170, 000. There's imagine I know that you got to replace your your furniture and your clothes and your appliances, but that's not going to cost 170, 000. It wouldn't even cost 100, 000. That's where you think about it. It's like you don't need that much coverage. I don't know if it it makes that much difference premium wise, but yes, let's let's drop that down to 50. Okay, we will look at it. I'm in here on the replacement cost. Let's see, built in 2022. Square footage 1560. That sounds right. I'm sorry. Say it again. Square footage is 1560. I think it's a little bit. Actually, it's 16 something. You'd have to check the tax records. I don't have it right in front of me, but I'm pretty sure it's it's 16 something. Online, it shows 1892. Is that? Square footage. Uh huh. It's not. It's not 1892. Let me pull out the tax card. Yeah, look at see what the tax record says. That Surrey County right. Yes. Let's see. 1612. Yeah, just going to like it. Let's change that. Is there? I can't double task. I couldn't multitask. I was going to ask you a question. I'm going to ring with and type that and ask you at the same time. Oh, judge. It's a cross face. Yes. All right. One level. Got a good two car attached garage. No, you have no garage. No garage. Did they have us? Did they have us as a attached garage? Yep. That's crazy. I'm glad we're talking. No, there's no there's no garage. It's just a rectangle shaped house and gravelled parking lot. All right, no carport or anything. Nothing. There is a I
