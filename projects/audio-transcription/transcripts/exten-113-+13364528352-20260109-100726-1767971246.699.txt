Thank for holding, it's scary. Hey Gary, this is one of the age. Have you received my messages, honey? I I received one of them and I returned the call and left you a message. Did you get that one? No, I've not got no call from you. Okay. Or got no messages either. My my, I just even checked voicemail just this morning and there was nothing in there. They just got that policy processed through cancellation the first of this week. And it was not our fault. It was the people that. That we use to do those transactions for us. So now how long are we looking at? You should not be waiting that long. You had a question for me something about the mortgage company. Well, yeah, that's what the big deal is. See, my payment, I was expecting all that to be you know transferred in there and yada yada yada and then you know kick off the new year with it being. A lower house payment, you know because my escrow would be lower. Did you? And it's not. It's actually it went up forty more dollars and I'm like, oh my. And literally guys, it took every bit of that. I've got my car insurances due. Power bills due, water bills due. I can't buy groceries. I can't buy medicine. I can't do anything. Well, one thing that I would suggest that you do is you need to contact the mortgage company and tell them that the new policy. They got it on there. They just said that you know. The reason it showed where I'm still having that payment. They need that check for the extra escrow. I will. I'll go with. They're showing. I've got. I've got a negative in the escrow and insurance part. And until that check is released, I'm going to stay in that and I'm going to be responsible for this payment. Um. Let me let me follow up on it again today and see if they have issued the check. Please do. I'm begging. Like I'm in tears. This has been going on since before Christmas. I didn't get to buy my kids or grandkids. Nothing for Christmas. I mean, it's hard. I don't know what I'm doing. I understand, and I will check on it for you and I'll call you back and um let you know. And if I don't get you on the phone, then I'll leave you a message. Okay, thank you. Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Bye bye. Bye bye.
