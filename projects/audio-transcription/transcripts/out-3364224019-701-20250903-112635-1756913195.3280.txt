Hi there, Nizmar. Uh, this is, excuse me, Nizmar. This is Jeremy, at Alliance Insurance. I was giving you a call back. I know we had spoke yesterday afternoon. We do not have a carrier that will, um, be anywhere in the neighborhood of where you're at currently with National General with the agency that you're with. Um, unfortunately, I don't I don't have any other options available for you currently. But I did wanted to keep you updated on that. Um, I do appreciate the opportunity as well to take a look at your business and, maybe we can look at it again later on, maybe in a year or so and maybe things will change there. Um, but again, thank you so much, and I just want to make sure you knew so you could go with some other quotes you'll probably get. Thank you. Talk to you later. Goodbye.
