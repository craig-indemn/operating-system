You're not hungry. I am at insurance services, Maria. Hi, good afternoon. Good morning, I need to um update my policy. I have a new HVAC system. Okay. I just want to I don't know I guess document whatever it is I don't know the the right term. Give me one second. What's your name on the account? Gladys Hernandez. Okay. And you purchased a new HVAC. Yes. And that was done just this week. Uh, actually September. Okay. I forgot to call. I've been on the call. Not a problem. I will make sure to update that with the homeowner's policy. Is there anything else I can do to help you? Um, I do have a quick question. Do homeowner's policy? Do they cover mold repair or like? I'm just curious. No, I don't believe yours does. Let's see here one second. Okay. Hi. Give me one second. Sure, let me see. No, I don't see that on there. Thinking I'm a nerd. Um. Oh, and I will be changing my gutters. I need to call when I do that too, right? I don't think not for the gutters. No. I will. Well, you can. We'll always document that in there just so it's updated. Absolutely. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Well, yeah. That's all. Okay. Thank you so much. All right. Thanks. Have a wonderful day. You too. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye.
