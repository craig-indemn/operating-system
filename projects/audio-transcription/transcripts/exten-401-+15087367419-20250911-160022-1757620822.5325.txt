Hello, this is Heather. Heather, hi. This is Jim Silver. I'm calling you about. Hey. How are you doing? I'm doing good. How are you? I'm finding this a good time, still. It is. Yes, I'm glad you called. Yep. So let me get your account pulled up. Yeah. Sure. Thank you. All right, and you're closing on your home, right? Yes. So we're it looks like we're going to close on nine twenty six. It looks like our current date. Nine twenty. Okay. All right. Okay. And then just trying to, yeah, so I sent you, I believe it was the Cincinnati package that we talked about. We rent, yeah. And auto owners as well. Yes. Yes. So I have I have a couple of questions about these comparing these two policies. I don't know if you control both of them up or how maybe you just actually maybe you start with the auto owners if you would mind the auto owners first. Okay. So I'm having I want to try and understand this this document you sent me. So the discounts I see discounts one of which is there's a ten thousand dollars deductible which I think is also what I put for the Cincinnati one. Yeah, we changed it. Right. And so. Trying to get into what. Oh sure, yeah, no, come when you're there, yeah, I don't want to start quitting and something. No, you go ahead. I'm listening to you. Yep, I'm just trying to get it pulled up here. I'm pulling up your what other owners so they have your I guess it's a renters policy that we have for here. Yeah, the renters in their in their cars. Yeah, that's the one that brought it. It pulled up so I'm trying to get into the quote for the new home. Okay, I've got it. Good. I've got auto owners pulled up. Yes. Okay, so I see. So we have a ten thousand dollars deductible. So and this price is obviously it's so much higher than Cincinnati's which I have to say I can't quite figure out how that can be how they're so different is that is that normal that quote. It is. Yeah, yeah, it it is normal. We see it a lot. Some carriers are just you know they have a better rating right now or. And it's so much that goes into the rating. I mean, you know, it's of course like for the home we put all the information in that you have provided that's on the tax document. You know, for square footage, what type of home, you know that the details of the home. The location is figured into that rating where it's located. Your credit, you know your, and when I write credit, I'm meaning like insurance score. So we don't really do like credit check. They just pull an insurance score, but that is factor in. So like your credit and how many claims you've ever filed. What not? So yes, there is just a lot that goes into that rating, and of course all that same information is is put into all the carriers the same information. So yeah, it's it's wild to see you know how like you said they do differ. Some of them significantly a lot of times they're close, so we do see this a lot. Okay, where they do. I mean, I so so so I see the one thing I wanted to ask too was the one thing we talked about in in that I wanted and unless I see where it is here on this on the auto owners one is the replacement cost. I don't know where I'm seeing that or if I am seeing it. I just don't see it here. The replacement cost of dwelling like coverage A is that what you're talking about referring to? I guess. So we have a one million forty one thousand two hundred ninety on auto owners. And I'm pulling up Cincinnati as well. Well, I guess so. But I guess my point is is like what I'm saying is if it in five years it costs more than that, where's the the service replacement cost increase in that amount. So each year they they evaluate it and so that's whenever I don't well you're renting now but. Each year they go in and they run the replacement cost like get your renewal. So you have been seeing a lot of people have been seeing like fifty percent increases because of inflation. Like I've seen like just take for instance if it was valued at five hundred thousand, the replacement cost last year we've seen it go up to like eight hundred thousand. So each carrier does that. You know they they evaluate the market and the replacement cost each year. Get your renewal. So you'll see you know when you get your renewal, not just the premium may go up. You're going to see those coverages go up as So the total premium is one thousand seventy-six dollars for the the earthquake. It's three sixty-four five percent. Okay, that's really. I mean, oh, I would definitely do that. Okay, okay. So another hundred and then the collision guard is two thirteen, which you can see that on there. Yeah, but that's four percent. Okay, and I guess so. In terms of the the auto insurance, seems to be pretty close between the two. It's just the homeowners are so much so much less. Okay, are you talking about the premium percent for Natty being less? Yes, yes, yeah, yeah. Um and again, I can't tell you. I don't, I don't put the numbers like I don't get to pick them. Yeah, no, fine. Whatever. After we put all this information in and add the endorsement or you know the extra coverages. Um, that it just populates that. Um. And I will tell you, like I said, Cincinnati has been my top carrier. I mean, they're they're an A and B rated carrier, but they I mean we write a ton of business with them because of that. They're very competitive. Right now, now that could change next year, right? It could be we may see where auto owners had their significant rate increases this year. Next year, maybe they'll stay flat, like no big increase or. And then Cincinnati may be that way next year. You know having these significant increases. We don't. We never know. Sure, I get that too. So you know, let's say I go with Cincinnati, which I get them. I'm kind to do. I'm going to think about it a little bit more. But in a year or two, if I want to change for some reason, I find out I don't like Cincinnati. Would it be very difficult to do, or can I just do that through you and go to? Yeah, no, because you know we write with all the carriers, so that's what we do. We definitely look at it every year for you too. You know you'll get a renewal call. Prior to your renewal, just to see if anything has changed. You know are we still happy where we at? You know things like that. So we do that every year. So I could I could shop around more next year if I just thought let me just see what else is out there. What like? Okay. No, we don't recommend it. I mean, you know you. Of course, you get the loyal discount too. The longer you are with a carrier, right? Um. So you know I I would not we don't recommend like changing just just to be changing every year. But like I said, if if you're very disappointed with Cincinnati and hopefully you wouldn't. Let's tell me you're going to have a claim to find out how the carrier really you know how when you're treated you know how that process works is what most people base their. I guess their relationship or how they feel about a certain carrier, but like I said, they've been awesome for us. Okay, can't be calling enough of them, but. We certainly will if you feel like hey no I want to I want you to shop my policies we will we'll definitely do that. Again, we don't recommend it just just for the heck of it. We always do is that I think I think our threshold was like thirty percent. If we saw a thirty percent increase or more, we automatically start shopping them. Okay. Well, let me just. You know, a few times Cincinnati's been good on their their claims and sort of their relationships with customers. That's really important. Yeah. Okay, them and auto owners have been. I mean, we've had auto owners for a long time now, but and they are they're up there with Cincinnati. Like I said, they they're they're our top two rated carriers. However, like I said, auto owners have just been having them significant rate increases. You know we saw it for the past two years with them. I know. So it's it's when you get a good rate like this, you know it's like I got to go with Cincinnati and that's been I've been writing most of my business with. And can I ask you what one one quick thing? Can you run just I don't know if you can do it quickly now because you run the the Cincinnati quote again with the deductible of five thousand versus ten thousand. Just in my own head, just to see what that looks like. Yeah, I've got it pulled up here. Yeah. Give me just a second. And I will tell you too. You were asking about you know why the difference in premium. I thought I apologize when you I when you first said that I thought you meant the difference in the replacement cost. You were referring to the premium. That car's definitely not insured by auto owners. No, that car's definitely insured by Massachusetts. No, no, no, not insured. But did you have auto owners at the time? Oh, we might have. Yeah, actually, we probably yeah we did. We just actually just had that auto owner. Yeah. I was going to say yeah so it looks like Heather the other Heather right your policy I believe um July 31st of 2024. So let me let me sure I understand them. Did do we insure that vehicle or you? Yeah, never insured it. Okay, gotcha. That vehicle. Yes. No, Massachusetts. Massachusetts that has been insured by Massachusetts. You know, my you said my all my you know all my cars, homeowners, everything through one company. We left it, but just kept that car insured in Massachusetts. Never insured by auto owners. There. Okay, so yes, we we can exclude that. We would just need some documentation, and that's all the question about if it was auto owners. I could go pull it, but since we wasn't the insured or the agent over that, I'm not able to pull that report. Um. Yeah, and the glass pane is you know it it is. That that was yeah that was on one of our cars I'm pretty sure so that makes sense. Yeah, that does. Yeah, this one is for nine three 2024, but it has you as the driver and at fault. For the glass one. And it. No, no, um, the one I guess is much recent. Oh, the one that could paint out. Oh, that's definitely my daughter. Oh, that's. Yeah. Yeah, nine three 2024, and it says you are driving, um, at fault, and so it's eligible for the surcharge. Um. No, no, no, no. Yeah, no, I get that. The cars are my yeah the cars are my name, but no, my daughter's definitely driving it. She's a good kid, but I'm gonna kill her. So. So I can definitely give that excluded like I said they just they're gonna require sure some documentation showing that she's drive she was the driver and it was on her insurance not yours. Well, it wasn't my insurance. I mean, I it's my car. Potato insurance on it. She just drives it because we don't need it anymore. Okay, but she's no longer in the household and she's not on your policy, so we can exclude it. Yes, she's not in the household. She's not in this policy. No, she and she will not be driving our cars. I mean, I guess she could visit, but no, no. Yeah, well maybe she can't visit after. I don't know. Maybe I want to vote. So we could get that excluded and it needs to be if it's not if it's false information on the report. Yeah, that's what the one. And then that could possibly I think that would help probably the premium. Yeah, you can it might come down some. And then again, I get Julie's driver's license number. So we'll update the license for Julie and get this get this one removed. This um fault. So that will be great. That will help. Yeah. Okay, I will work on both of those things and I will get back to you. And I really appreciate you taking the time and your patience with me. Oh, absolutely, Jim. Yes, anytime. Um. Yep, we that's what we're here for. So you well thank you very much. And um, yeah, so I'll look this over and I'm sure by by Monday I will figure out what we're doing, how to pay it when it gets started, all that stuff and just just get it done. So. You're welcome. I will tell you I'm on vacation all next week. Okay. Good to you. So and yeah, oh thank you. But if you you can always email me. I'll have my laptop with me. Or if you want to call and speak to someone, ask to speak to Heather Johnson the other Heather because she worked with you and she's familiar with your account and stuff. So yeah, if you need to move this forward or need any revisions or you know like I said if you need to get it found and say which is a mortgage or that y'all are doing a loan right. No, actually, it's going to be cash purchases. I'm going to be fine with it. But oh, okay, so they're not going to require this right away then. So we could actually wait closer to the 26. Yeah, yeah, but you know I don't want you too long. But sure, so I will. Oh, absolutely not. Yeah. So if you
