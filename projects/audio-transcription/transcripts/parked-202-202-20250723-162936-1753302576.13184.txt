Hey Michael. Have you got it now? No, it looks like she's trying to afford something, and I got two, but they're just blank. There's nothing there. Okay. So if it's easier for you just to run to Clemens, do that, and that way we don't get frustrated with it. Where is the office set in Clemens? Yeah, I sent her the address on via text. So it's twenty two fifty five, Louisville Clemens Road. Twenty two. Fifty five. Twenty two, fifty five. Clemensville. Louisville Clemens. Right. Whenever I I get off, okay, I'll find it. Yeah, let me see what's nearby. So there's a Edward Jones, there's a Risk Advisor Group. It's like a brick building looks like. So. I don't see anything that I actually. Can give you a landmark though, but yeah. Twenty two fifty five. Okay, Louisville Clemens Road. Yep. Y'all might come look it up on the internet and and do GPS to get there. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Thank you. Bye bye. Stop. Thank you.
