Thanks for holding the scary. Hello, sir. This is me, lad Bivay. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. How are you? I'm good. I have my coverage for my home will be due on September. And delivered to and Northwest Farmers sent me the document for renewal and I found about 300 extra this year. Do you have the policy number that you could give me? Yes, sir. N as in Nancy, W as in William, F as in Frank. Two zero two two two six three five. Okay, so two zero two two two. Yes, six three five. Six three five. Let me get the phone number for you. Okay. Not pulling up that policy number. Okay, your phone number's three three six six zero two three four nine zero. Yes, sir. Okay. Trying to find it here for you. Let's see what's going on with it. Yeah, in the document they sent me. They said the coverage for pool. I don't have pool. And things like that. Northwest Farmers they probably had an exclusion on there. For that pool. They said it's included. Does that mean? So you do not have a pool, but they included it on there. And I don't have pool at all. Let me just look it over here just a minute. I'm trying to get the document for the new. Is there a renewal button online, but I cannot. They they have trouble sometimes getting those documents for you. So we'll probably have to do that for you ourselves. Okay. Please. Let me see. I'm just looking through the policy information here. I have not known them to have coverage for the pool on there. They normally exclude that right off the bat. So. I will probably have to call them. I just called them and they refused to do anything for me and they said I have to contact the agent. You're kidding. No, I'm not. Really, I'm not. And so you called the king number right. I I called their phone number and they refused to talk even to me and I I get here see. Swimming pool restrictions included. Dog restriction exclusion included. If it says that the pool exclusion is included. No, they they don't say for the swimming pool exclusion. They said swimming pool restriction. Included. Yeah, that's the. I don't think. That's the exclusion for coverage. Means what? When they put that restriction on there, then that basically means that they're not going to cover a swimming pool. So why it's included? Included means it's in the price, correct? Well, the document the document is included, but the actual document is a swimming pool restriction. That is included to your policy. So why that price going high that much? Last year was six forty six. This year will be nine one nine. Well, all of the coverages for all of our carriers are are increasing. I can tell you that. But that's not that much. Almost more than two hundred fifty. More than that. Customers that have had increases of five and six hundred dollars from last year. Oh my god. Yeah, it's it's pretty bad. Really is. What are the coverages? What are the coverages that we have with you? What are the policies that we have with you? We are nothing good. This is only one of. Just the homeowners, who do you have your auto insurance with? I have it with another company because the estimate I got from your company was too high. Compared to the auto. How much was that quoted for you? I have it about two two years now, and every time I'm calling, you give me more than what others. And the company I am with now every year decreases the premium. Nothing increases. If you if you want to check for me, that's fine. You can check. We'll make sure that one. We're on the same page here. It looks like what we already have. Your we've got an auto policy with you with Progressive. I have it, but not through you. Not through your company. We've got another issue. Policy schedule with us. No, it's not. It was at about four years ago. Through your the Alliance company, but not anymore. This must be just a household account. See. Okay. So you need a copy of your declaration page. No, I got it already. They sent it by mail for me. Very good, but they wouldn't give me. Yeah, but I want to see why it's that high. Is there any way to decrease it or find another company can give me a better quote? Well, we're not going to have another company that just sells the auto or the homeowners by itself. That's going to be beneficial to you. I would not think. We could certainly look into it for you if you want to do that. Okay, that's why
