Sorry for your hold. This is Cody. May I help you? Hey Cody, this is Donnie with MPE Rentals in Morgantown, West Virginia. Hey Donnie, how are you, sir? Hey good. Hey, are you familiar with the certificate of insurance? For Fralin. Yeah, I don't know how pronounced half of that, but yeah, that's it. I got an insurance certificate here. List us at the bottom as a certificate holder. But it really I don't see where it shows. For rented or leased equipment valued at up eighty thousand on it. Yeah, usually that email. So it's needing to say what. Need value up to eighty thousand for the rented or leased equipment. Valued up to eighty thousand. And where it says equipment, there I don't know if that's rental equipment or if that's I don't know what. But that's just twenty five thousand. It looks like they're. Property and transit. Check with the underwriter. When are they looking to lease this piece of equipment? They're wanting to do it on the eighteenth, which is Tuesday. Okay. And check with the underwriter. Where's that email you had sent? I think either Zach Foley sent it or the the guy you were just talking about Fralin. Fralin. Yeah, and if you guys need the model serial number and make, I can do that as well. Let's try to find your email so I can put that in my case in our system. What day was that sent? Was it yesterday? I think I don't know when. It probably was yesterday. Let me see. Let me see if I have anything on my emails. Because he actually came through the front door with this copy. He didn't email it. He didn't forward it to me or anything. I don't believe. Okay. But I'm going to look in just in case. Yeah, I don't see where. I mean, I can email you the stuff if you need it too. If you have that email and you could forward it to me, I'm having trouble locating it here. Let's see what this one has here. This might be it. That's fine line trim. That's not it. Oh, I think I see it. Maybe. All right. I think this is it here. This is something different. Yeah, this isn't you got. Yeah, he just brought it in the front door is what he did. So he didn't send me that email. What's the email address that it came from? Well, I got a Zachary Foley. At is the Z A C H A R Y F thirty five at Gmail. That's where, but that's not that was. That was the wrong one. That was from a different insurance company. Yeah, I meant the email that was sent to me. Oh, that uh. Okay, so this is all your information. See, I didn't send you the email. It had to be. Fralin sent it to you. It wasn't for. I didn't send you one, but I can. That might be simpler if I just send it to you. You had sent an email requesting the eighty thousand. It didn't come from me, but I did give him a piece of paper. That I wrote on. It's like a form. But I don't know. What is your email address? See Cody at my alliance. Yes, my alliance insurance dot com. All right. Well, let me. I'll send you all that information. Yeah, if you'll just send me everything that you need or whatever, and like. Yeah. I don't think that I'll have to schedule the piece of equipment. As long as they had just have the. That amount of the rented or leased right. Yeah, yeah, and I equipment just in case I need to schedule it or anything, then that would be great. Yeah, and they are keeping it. Because I told you when they were getting it, I didn't tell you the twentieth is when they were going to send it back. What type of equipment are they? It's a it's a rough it's called a telehandler. It's like a forklift that it extends out. Yeah. What's the value of it? Eighty thousand. Eighty thousand. Uh huh. Yeah, if you'll just send me the information on it. Yes. Yes, sir. Then I will. I'll talk to the underwriter and get that coverage out of. Then I can send you an updated certificate. Okay, I'll get to working on it. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Bye bye.
