This is Jerry Taylor. I'm not able to take your call at this time. Please leave your message or your phone number, and I will return the call. Have a good day. Hey Jerry, this is Corbin over at Lions Insurance. Hey, just wanted to say I made that payment for your homeowners this morning. Should have got a receipt, but into your email box. And then I also ordered you a policy so you can look at those endorsements at the bottom. They said I should have it within 24 to 48 hours digitally, which means email. Hope I can forward it to you next week, and you can do that Control F and look those up. But if you haven't heard anything from me by Thursday, maybe just call me and I'll check on that for you. But you should have that in your email once I get it. I'm talking about the policy, the homeowner policy. Anyway, any questions three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Have a great weekend. Bye bye.
