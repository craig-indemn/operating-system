Thank you for holding. This is JC. How may I help you? This is Tracy. No, it's JC. JC, sorry about that. Hey, my name's Edward. Are you the lady that helped me the other day? Yeah, I think. Oh, I think. Sorry, I didn't remember your name. That's okay. Oh, I see it. I see it on the email. I just was trying to look up the email. Um, so I did talk to the guys at Winburn Real Estate and they wanted to see if I could add them to the policy. To um. Ten twenty five around Delta Street. Okay. Yeah. Is that it? Easy thing to do. Um, I think for that company we have to email in that endorsement. I can take that information and submit it over to them, but I won't have a declaration page available. I'd say by next week I will. I don't think I'll have it today. I can give you a binder. I don't know if that will suffice their needs. No, I think it even next week will be fine. Okay, I'll take that information from you whenever you are ready. Um. What did you say their name was? It's a Winburn Real Estate. So it's W I N D. B U R N two separate words. Real Estate LLC. Their address is two zero six. West. Four. Street. Okay. Winston Salem, North Carolina two seven one zero one. Um. Yeah, I think that's all he put actually in the email. As far as that's what needs to be added. Okay. Thanks for help. Absolutely, I just want to make sure that I got that spelling right. Did you say W is in whiskey, Y is in Yankee, and is a November and D is in Delta? No, it's winds like the word wind. W I N D. W I N D. Yeah. And then. Yeah, burn. B U R N. Yeah, like you are burning something. Okay. Thank you. Of course. Okay, Winburn Real Estate LLC. Their address. I'll go ahead and add them. Is this a? Their lender. No, they they're like a private lender and they just want me some money to remodel that house. So I guess they're mortgage. I don't know how that works. We'll figure it out. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, we'll go ahead and get this added for you. Did you um? Want the copy of the declaration page once I have it. Um, you can do that prior to the. It taking a week, you say. I I want to assume that it would. I am not one hundred percent sure. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, if you could email it to me, that would be awesome. Okay. Thank you. Of course. All right. I'll get that added for you. Okay. Have a good day. Awesome. You too. Thanks. Bye. Bye.
