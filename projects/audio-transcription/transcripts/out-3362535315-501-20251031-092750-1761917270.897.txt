Yeah. Hey, hello. Hi there, Brad. I'm so sorry. I'm working from home today. I had a delivery for a project and my dog's been going crazy. I was afraid I wouldn't be with you, so sorry. Okay, trust me. My dog's been going crazy today too. I have to start teaching a class in like two minutes for my job. And so basically, I think if I had an insurance card emailed to me and I'm wondering, could Carvana just use the policy as I have it with liability because I'm paying the car in full. Yes, yes, I say what I'll do. I will email you ID cards and a deck page showing coverage. And then you can just you if you'll just reply back to me with the VIN number when you have a chance. I can give you the VIN number. I can give you the VIN number
