Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes. Hey, my name is Stuart Blanton. I'm one of your old customers. But the reason I was calling is is last week I got a notice from my insurance company saying that my policy had been renewed. And I kind of had two one two questions. One, I didn't think it needed to be renewed till next month. And the second one is I hadn't talked to anybody there about doing that, so I was just calling to see what's going on. Okay, well give me one moment and I will get an agent back in help. Okay.
