James. Yes, sir. Sorry for the delay right there, man. Thank you for hanging in there with us. So you were starting. I ask essentially, is the price going to come down? Over time, well. Don't expect it to, James. That's the best I can tell you. A startup company with what you are about to do, you are going to go into a surplus. You are going to go into an excess market. No standard carrier. It's likely to pick this up new, high risk higher than normal all that kind of thing. So you'll be over in surplus. You'll be in the surplus market for at least two years, maybe three. Three years from now, when you come over in twenty-eight, you come over to a standard carrier. The rate itself per exposure or per dollar that it's rated on or one hundred dollar revenue that it's rated on may be a little bit lower. But it don't expect any price savers at that point if that makes sense. I see. Go ahead. Whether or not whatever you are doing, you are going to pay that big premium period. Yeah, you are. If you do it right, and James, I am. Let me tell you upfront, there is going to be people out here that can absolutely cut some corners and shave some coverages and maybe even leave coverages off completely. And it won't it won't be that price point. But if you do it right and if you have a comprehensive package that has adequate coverage. For what you are doing, that's going to be the price point, right? But you'll find agencies all over everywhere and agents. Oh, you don't need this much. You don't need that or whatever. And that's fine. Some people take the cheaper route to put money back in their pocket. But I can assure you. When a claim comes, you are going to wish you paid those extra couple hundred bucks or those extra few thousand bucks for that coverage because that claim is not going to go away for. That claim is not going to go away for two or three hundred dollars or two or three thousand dollars. I see what you are saying. Yeah, yeah, we were fortunate, and I had a business for eleven years that I had insurance on it the whole time. Never knock on wood. Never had to use it. That's awesome. I am glad. I hope that would be the case. But the one time you have to, especially in the business. We're not talking about a homeowner's or a personal auto. Where you pay a hundred dollar deductible and forget about it, but you are talking with a business and a public exposure. Those claims can get really get really expensive, especially cars these days. So absolutely, is this something you you want to pursue? You want to consider? You want to put on the back burner. What we want? How can we help you move on forward? Well, the other thing I wanted to see was was, and maybe it's the same price. I don't know. What does it cost roughly if I were to just do like just say local towing and no mechanical work? Is it still the same cost? No, it's a different exposure. It's yeah, it's a different exposure. But I wouldn't want to go out and drive drive to South Carolina. Nothing like that at all. Yeah, so that you know that will be real heavy on the business auto. Hey, what size is the vehicle? How much is the vehicle way? Do you have to register for a DOT number? Is it just an F two hundred and fifty and you are hauling light duty private passenger? What are you hauling? What's the the value of that or the weight weights of that? What's your radius? Right, are you fifty mile tow truck driver or you a two hundred mile recovery drive? What is that? Right. Do you do roadside assistance? Do you do repost? There is a lot more questions to fill in the blanks on just a different exposure. And I can't tell you what that what that may be. That that needle moves a lot in that truck and space, but I can assure you. They don't give it away. I promise you that. So you are going to be into it. I would say at least that much. That probably a fair assessment. Five grand is probably a launching point. Five grand or higher. And again, it depends. Okay, what you know? What's my vehicle? Was my vehicle worth ten grand? Is my vehicle worth one hundred and fifty grand? Well, we got to cover that for that value. So there is a lot of variables, but five grand and up and just depends. What kind of towing are you doing? Are you towing on a gooseneck, a flat bed? Do you have a roll back? What do you have? Well, I was going to start off with I just have a go
