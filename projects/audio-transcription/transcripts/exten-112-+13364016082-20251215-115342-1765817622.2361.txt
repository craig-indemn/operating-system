Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Yes, ma'am. You call my phone earlier. I was in the doctor's office. Teresa Brigel. Okay. Give me one second and let me get you pulled up. Okay. Okay, so yes, I was giving you a call because your homeowner's policy is coming up for. Actually, no, it's not coming up for renewal because it just renewed in September. But we wanted to review that with you to make sure that everything was up to date on the policy. And then to see if there is any other insurance needs that we we might be able to help you with. Okay. Let me get everything on the policy pulled up that way I can start asking any questions. Okay. So don't change nothing, do. All right. So it looks like we have your mailing address as one sixty Locust Lane in Mount Airy. Is that still correct? Yes, ma'am. Okay, and then of course we do have. If my computer will load. We have you and Denise Sandfield on the policy. Is that? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. And it looks like I have a phone number for you, but I don't have a phone number for Denise. Can we get that phone number just in case we can't get in touch with you? Three three six four zero one six zero seven one. Okay. And do either of y'all have an email address? Denise has an email address, but I can't tell you what it is. On it, she's not here right this minute. Okay. No problem. All right, and. All right, and have you guys made any updates to the home at all in the past? No, ma'am. Uh oh. No. And we do have this home insured for one hundred and seventy five thousand two hundred and sixty one. That's just you know if anything were to happen you know one hundred percent to the home total loss that is what you would get back to replace it. And you do have a five hundred dollar deductible on that. Okay. And then of course two coverages that are not covered under this homeowner's policy is earthquake and flood. That would be separate coverages. No thanks. And if we have a flood right here, we'll be in deep water. We live up top of a hill. We just have to let everybody know as far as the homeowner's policy goes. That's right. I got you. I got you. All right, and then do y'all have an auto policy somewhere? We do. Okay, and who's that through? Southern States. Say that one more time. Southern States. Okay, is that like an agency or? Wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. State Farm. I am sorry. State Farm. Okay. Yeah, it's like a farm. Is. Well, you know we do auto insurance too, along with health insurance, Medicare, and life insurance. So if at any point in time you would want us to help with any of that, we definitely can. If your auto policy was here, you would get a discount on the homeowner's policy. It is a small discount, but sometimes it can help. Yeah. So if that's something that you want to look at at your next renewal, whenever your renewal comes up with State Farm, just let us. Y'all, y'all do life insurance. We do. Can you send me some information? So the only information that I would be able to send is basically a quote. Oh okay. I mean life insurance. There is there is a lot of information about it. We work with several different companies. Right. So like depending on your health, your age, that's what you buy insurance buy life insurance from. If you are a smoker, that takes an effect as well. But basically, a life insurance policy can cover you for you know the time being for a temporary time period whether it's twenty to thirty years. And then at the end of that, you could get the money back, or you can transfer it to a permanent policy. Right. You know it all depends on what you are needing life insurance for. If it's to cover debt or if it's just to cover your burial whenever you are whenever you were to pass. And to help with a significant other or family, then that then you would definitely want something permanent. Right. And I mean right now I would say for a burial, the cost for you know the opening closing at the funeral home. To have all that there, then the burial site you are looking about twenty thousand. Ten or twelve thousand. Well, I just raised my brother and it cost us almost ten thousand dollars. Yeah, I, I know all about that. Yeah, I mean I am saying twenty just because you know there might be other things. It might be a different funeral home.
