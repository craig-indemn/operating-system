Hello, I am Kobe. Kobe, hey sir, this is Joe at Alliance Insurance. How are you? Um, good Joe, how are you doing? I am wonderful. Much of that will depend on how this phone call goes. Well, hopefully it'll be a good one. What you got? No, I am just kidding. I am kidding. Hey, I know about a half hour. Joe, you send an update or update email to Kendall on Jupiter, the commercial package Jupiter LLC, the new startup that seems to be broad in their reach. Um, just about the same time you sent that over, the customer is inquiring about essentially an ETA. They're trying to they're trying to bid on a job. And I don't know, Kobe. You tell me. I don't know if we can get there. You know what are you feeling? What are you thinking? I know there's been a lot of back and forth, a lot of follow up questions and information provided. Is this something that you all believe you'll get comfortable with? Maybe not. Do we have a realistic chance? You know, tell this gentleman, yes sir, we're you know we're putting it together, or you know what, just not going to fit. Absolutely. So I just sent. I just finished working on this and sent it off to be set up as a quote for the GL. So Kendall has and and I'm guessing you as well have sent everything that I needed. You know the contracts and the the resume. So yeah, I have everything I need and I'm working on that GL quote right now. I let Kendall know that. I I'm not going to be able to quote the excess liability right now because they're a new venture. I'd like to wait at least a year. Is that going to mess with their their contract requirements at all? Not sure at this point what those contract requirements are initially. I I'm confident that they will need that eventually. If not right out of the gate, that will be a coverage bill. Probably have to have a satisfied contract. But so with that in mind, right with that in mind, with GL I'm a seven you know one million two million but if you guys are comfortable with one million two million, maybe we backdoor it with a higher GL limit possibly. We're not there yet, but just as a plan B to sidestep excess with that with that. Well, that would kind of be doing the same thing as excess. Well, not as we we have. Yeah, possibly. We have the availability to do higher limits on the GL. To be honest, this is not a class that we would typically entertain that sort of coverage for just because of the nature of the risk. Sure. And because these guys can really get into some, some sticky situations sometimes. So we like to. You know the the resumes and they had a scope of. I think they sent in like a scope of what they their capabilities. That's that's really the biggest thing that made quoting this account possible. Because I can really only quote new venture security operations when it is readily apparent that these guys know what they're doing. And from the resumes that I read, it definitely seems like that's the situation here. Is is these guys have experience? They're they're military. Um. Now they are still a new venture, which is why I have to be a little cautious with providing excess limits or higher GL limits. Now in in. Now after we have a year of coverage, um, that could be a different story. And also, really for for my sake and yours, they're a new venture, so they could decide. Hey, we're we're actually going to switch gears completely. We're going to go into casino work. And we're going to go into maybe some operations that. You know. Yeah, I get it. No, I get it. I understand completely. Understand. So yeah, we just we just don't want to be a little. We don't we don't want to jump the gun here. Let them I think get letting them get get some contracts, get a little more organized, realize where their niche is. That that will be a better place in conversation for that excess liability. Um, but I know getting GL is probably priority right now. Okay, look forward to hearing. That sounds good. Terrible. No kid. I totally kid. I totally. To be expected, Kobe. Appreciate the honesty and the transparency. To be expected, just you know quite frankly, a little bit too much too early. Could be going on here, right? Even though the the qualifications and experience that they have shown very impressive, very well qualified. Right, it would appear I think we can all agree on that. But you know new is still new. And new today could be completely different new tomorrow. And that's that's high risk and I can I can appreciate that we
