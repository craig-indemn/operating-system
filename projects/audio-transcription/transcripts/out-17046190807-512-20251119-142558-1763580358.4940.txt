Hello, Jimmy. Jimmy, hey it's Joe at Alliance. How are you? Hey Joe, what's up? Hey, just calling you back from a little bit ago, half hour or so ago. So, like I said, I was out of the office today too, but I talked to both Kendall and Jeff. Two separate situations. Everything's fine. So Jeff sent you that. Request this morning. On that smaller amount, seventy thousand. Yeah, yeah. All right. When you turn that around, please just send it to him. You're welcome to see see me, but I'm out for the rest of the week. And let his name be on it if you don't mind, please. He'll he'll deliver it to InvictaCon and then separately Kendall. Forded you and I, I was mistaken. The walk-in freezer project for Bristol, Virginia is a performance bond, Jimmy. Oh, okay. And it got delayed. Just read her email. It got delayed 30 days. They want to make sure that the performance bond does cover that 30 day delay on the back end. You know, instead of projected end date of March, they had it or now have it projected end date of April. Okay. And I thought in my head, and I said, "Okay, I'll say, Kendall, you know, I'm not at your, I'm not, you know, up to speed on it. It's not in front of me, but what in the performance bond be for a year anyway?" And yeah, pretty so. Usually the yeah, I think we do them on like a a two year deal, but the first year is kind of just thrown in there and then. Anything after a year, we might get into a a charge maybe. I can follow up on that. But are are they needing the bond now? Even though it doesn't start for a while. For one second. Yeah. Let me go back to the email. Yes, not starting till March, the 30th. And they want to make sure that we've already delivered the bond on this Jimmy. The performance bond has already been delivered, and that's why I was like, hey, they should be good for 12 months unless we request otherwise. I don't I don't think this is even an issue, but. Maybe to ensure doesn't understand that. So double check it. The Bristol walk-in closet or walk-in closet, excuse me, walk-in freezer. Performance bond issued. The end date should run through April 30th. All right. I'm going to note all this and then come next year when this thing ends, we'll figure out if it was you know if there was. Not that much of an overrun, we might be able just to waive any additional premium. We'll just wait. Yeah, and I and I don't think there's an overrun at all because this thing didn't start too late this year. Yeah. So I think we we can reuse it. That's no problem. Okay. Well, Jimmy, I really appreciate it, buddy. Thank you. All right, man. Take care. Bye.
