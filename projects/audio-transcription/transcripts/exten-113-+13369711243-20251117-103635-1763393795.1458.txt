Thanks for holding this, Gary. Gary, this is Deborah Trivet. I. You called me while ago. I did. We were just doing our annual reviews on your policy information. Want to know if you've had any changes on anything? No. Okay. So all the drivers are correct, and the usage of the vehicles they correct as well, Miss Trivet. Yeah. Okay. And I just want to double check on the address and the email address, and I've got Trivet D D at Windstream dot net. That's correct. And an address of eleven fifty eight Kurt Boyle's Road in King, is that correct? Yes, it is. And um, now you only have your auto. Do you do you rent your home or do you own your home? I own my home. Who do you have your homeowners with? I should have known you would ask me that. I can't. Well, the reason I ask is you're coming up for renewal in January and there's possibility that we may be able to combine the coverages for you and save you a little bit of money. Do you know when it renews? I think it renewed in August. In August, okay. It may have been September. I can't. I don't know. If you can check the dates on that and let us know, it's it's best to try to combine those things at the renewal on the auto because once the auto starts and you try to cancel the auto, then they will penalize you for that. But they don't do that on the homeowners. So if you can find out who the company is and we can get a little bit of information, then we could quote the home at the same time that the auto renews to try and package that for you if you'd be interested in that. Well, I'm not at home, so I would have to look after I got home. That would be fine, and if you decide to do that, just call back and we will help you with that. Okay. Okay. All right. Very good. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good day. Thank you, you too. Bye bye. Bye bye.
