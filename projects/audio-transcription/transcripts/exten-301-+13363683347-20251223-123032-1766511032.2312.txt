Thank you for holding this. Hi, this is Farin calling from West Ridge Insurance. I think I spoke with you yesterday. Hi, so um, Miss Truvella Palmer, I submitted the insurance docs you sent me, but they are saying they need an actual deck page. Is there any way for you to send me that? Yes, what did I send you yesterday? This is Eli. Yeah. Okay. Let me make sure that I can pull it up first before we get off the phone. I apologize. Oh, it's just me in particular. Yeah, I totally get it. Okay, yes, I will send that deck page over to you. Just give me a few minutes. All right. Thank you very much. No problem. Bye. Alright.
