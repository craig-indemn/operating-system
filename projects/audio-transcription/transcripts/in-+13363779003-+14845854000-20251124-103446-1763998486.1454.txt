Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hi, good morning. This is Eric Guitar calling from USLI. I was looking for Gloria Bell's. Um, so she is out of the office this week. Um, can I send you to her voicemail? Sure, no problem. Okay, one second. Um, if I can find her, oh, there we go. I can always email her. That's fine. No worries. Okay, I'll meet that one. Okay, thank you. Have a good day. Bye bye.
