Hello. Name is Pierre Minigary at Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Did you get everything resolved on your claim? I saw that notice out here. Did they get you taken care of? Well, I'm supposed to pick up parts. There was a problem in ordering, in getting parts. Okay. And so it's taken longer than I think anybody expected. Yeah. But I just talked to them today. And it should be ready by three tomorrow. Okay. Great. Great. It's been it'll be five weeks on Tuesday I think. Yeah that's crazy isn't it. It is ridiculous and I didn't know they were having problems with parts and. They told me two weeks ago. Well, it depends. I think really on the make and model of the car and that could have something to do with it. Now as far as everything else goes, are you okay with everything? Well, they told me that the insurance had approved the estimate. I talked with the adjuster. My I got to go to Enterprise today because this is the last day that the insurance covers. According to her, and I called them and they're going to let me keep it, but I'm going to pay for the extra day myself. They're going to give you the same rate they had before. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Good. Well. Good. And I guess I have a 500 deductible right. I can show it here in just a second. Let me look at it. So I I was I mean, Accura hasn't said anything to me about paying, but I figured I have to pay the 500. Just let me look at it here a minute. I was really calling you to see if you needed any updates to your tenants or auto policy, and then I ran across its claim. So I said, "Well, I'll just call her and see how that went." Well, they don't tell you very much. Uh, 500. Yes, ma'am. Yeah, so I was expecting to have to pay that when I put my car up. Correct. Correct. Is there anything else that we can do for you? No. Nothing else. I just want my car back and hope it. I hope it's like new. It should be like new. Those repairs are are guaranteed to you. So just make sure that you pay special attention to that. Okay. Okay. If there's any problems with it, then they should be able to make it make it right, and as long as you own the car. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye bye. You have a good day. Bye.
