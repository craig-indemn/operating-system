Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hey, how you doing? I'm doing good, and you? I'm doing, I reckon. Uh, I got a question. Okay. Water policy. Uh, I had a tree limb fall down yesterday. Uh huh. And it took out the power lines, the internet lines, and all that. Duke Power come and hooked it up today. Uh huh. And they said when it the line blew when it snapped the line, it sent a surge to the box at the house. And my refrigerator's cooked, my humidifier's cooked. And I got some other electrical issues in two rooms. Okay. Well, let me. I'll go ahead. I'm just wondering what I need to do if I'm covered with that stuff for one. Okay. Yeah, let me get you over to an agent. Just one moment. Okay.
