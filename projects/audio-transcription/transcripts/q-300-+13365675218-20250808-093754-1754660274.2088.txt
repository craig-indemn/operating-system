Thank you for holding. This is Jacy. How may I help you? Hi Jacy. My name is Jasmine. Um, I wanted to know. I have a quick question. Wanted to know how much more it would be. If because I I saw that um on my my policy, I have two vehicles that don't have the uninsured underinsured. Motorist body injury and the uninsured motorist property damage. I just I just wanted to know how much more it would be. To get those two vehicles to have that. Okay. Um. You said your name was Jasmine. Jasmine Boyno. Yes. Okay. Give me one second. And is it with a Z or an S? Z. Okay. Give me one second. Let me pull up your account. While I'm doing that, if you don't mind, just confirming your address one please. Fifty-seven before Ottawa Street, Winston Salem, North Carolina, twenty-seven one hundred six. Thank you very much. And I'm pulling up your policy now. Okay. And what vehicle are we referring to? Um. The. The Mazda the two thousand I think it's two thousand six if I'm not wrong, and then the twenty twenty five GMC. Okay. So you do have that on your policy, the uninsured and underinsured. Oh, okay for. For all the vehicles or. Yes. Uh huh. All of them. Oh, okay. I was trying to make sure because when I looked at the document. It has said no cost, no cost. So I didn't understand what did that mean exactly. Okay. Um. It probably just isn't charging you. It's charging you under a different um and without looking at the document, I don't know 100. But my best guess would be. That it's charging that under a different. A different um. Can I one second here? Okay, because um and one of the vehicles on the the oldest vehicle that I have on there is a 1999. That one shows it. It shows how much it is. Oh really okay. Let me take a look at that. Ninety nine. Okay, I'm looking at that document. I see where it says no cost there. Um. I have to check with National General. So just give me a few minutes and I'll try to get an answer for you. Okay, sounds perfect. Thank you. Okay. All right. It looks like it's going to take a little bit longer than expected. Did you want me to give you a call back with this information? Please, if you could. Okay. Yeah, unless you have time to to hold, it's completely up to you. But I didn't want to keep you on the line too long. I mean, I can hold, and if you if that's okay with you. Yeah, that's perfectly fine. I don't have a problem. I just wanted to make sure that. You know, you knew it was going to be a little longer than expected. That's fine. I'll hold. Okay. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Hi Jasmine, I'm back. Jasmine, are you still with me? Hello.
