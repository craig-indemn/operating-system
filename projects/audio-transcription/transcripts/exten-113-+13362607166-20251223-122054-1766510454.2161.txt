Lines, is your answer scary? Hey Gary Joe Leonard here. How are you, sir? Joe, how are you? I'm doing well. I have, I piddled with the signing a little bit last week and didn't finish them because I didn't get the chance to read it. I think I've done it this morning. I think I've just completed it. Could you? Man, let me look real quick. Because Christmas is coming up in a day or two and then I'm going to be extremely busy and so will you. So I like to I want to verify this before Christmas and and just so you'll know I've got. I don't think I signed either one of them completely and I got information from Cincinnati that they've already billed me so. Well, you you you can disregard those bills because the payments have been posted on those. So those documents must have went out before the. I got those today at 11:30. Okay. I'm not complaining. I'm just saying. It looks like that you did you completed all of them. It looks like if if something comes up it's not correct. I'll get back in touch with you and and we'll correct it. But it looks like I did get them back so you should be fine. I just wanted to double check because Christmas will come up and then both of us will be busy and I don't want to. You did. No, you're going all this to happen in time. You know what I mean. I got you and everything is everything is is correct. And let's see, yep, looks fine to me. And if you need anything from me, then you just call me back. I don't I don't think I do because I think everything is downloadable. I'm not mistaken. It it is. Did you get information to set you up an online account with them? Uh, not with them. I think I got one from Alliance. On the glove box app, probably. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not much into the. Well, you can go direct to Cincinnati and and there should be a a web page on there. If you want to go direct to the company and set one up, of course we do have one within the organization. Ourself, it's called glove box. And and you should, I will just. When the policy processes, you will get a notice that ask you if you want to get that app and you just yes or no. And then it will have all of your policy information in there. Home auto, you can go in there and print print deck pages or ID cards or whatever. What is the the app called? Well, it comes from Cincinnati. No, well, glove box comes from us. Okay. But it holds all of your policy information. If you want to deal directly with the company, then you can go to cinfin. That's F is in Frank. Cinfin. Dot com. Okay. And you can set up an account direct with the company. You know for you. You don't have to worry about the billing or anything because that's been paid. But we always give our customers that glove box app because if if you make any changes or something on the holiday or weekend when we're going to be out of the office. You can request those through that app. If you're trading cars and things like that, you can make those type of request through that application. So if you don't, yeah, you just pay attention. Then see if you pay attention and see if you get that and if not, just contact me back and we'll make sure we get that set up for you. Okay. I've got I've got some emails from from Cincinnati and I see the cinfin. Dot com. Right. And I'm not seeing the glove box yet. I don't know who. Well, it won't go through until. Well, this this signing that you did for me. I send those applications in yes and then once all that's finalized, then that should be generated to you. So it may take a couple days. And at least get you through Christmas holiday anyway. Okay. Yeah, yeah. And as I'm setting you and I are talking, I get the confirmation of both the signing app. Oh, I've got confirmation of. I got the confirmation of the payments before I actually signed them. Okay, very good. And that's what triggered me. Oh crap! I need to do that signing. Yeah, see, I couldn't post the payments until this morning because their billing system is a step behind the application system. And so I had to post those payments this morning, and that's why you got those. You should have gotten a receipt for each of those. I do. Twenty two twenty two fifty nine for. I guess that'd be the home. The auto and then about eleven fifty. Eleven five for the home. Yep.
