Hello, this message is for Cecilia. This is Jeremy at Alliance Insurance, and I received a request for an auto quote. On insurance, and I had sent an email yesterday. It looks like you opened the email, but you didn't click on the link to send me, in essence, a copy of your coverages that you currently have and the VIN numbers. I also would need your driver's license and date of birth. So if you could get that information to me, that would be great. You can email me Jeremy J E R E M Y at myallianceinsurance dot com. Or you can give me a call at three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. That's three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. I look forward to hearing from you and being able to help take care of you. Talk to you soon. Bye.
