Hello, it's William. Hey William, this is Brandy with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Good, Brandy. Good, I got your voicemail. I was going to let you know. I'll try to reach out to the adjuster and just see how things are going and you know, what's the next step, what's happening, so that I can get you a, an update on that. Yeah, because I called the stop. I called the stop last week to make an appointment, and they still hadn't received whatever paperwork they need from auto owners. And then my daughter's car in yesterday had been let on, and I called him this morning, and they still don't have any paperwork from auto owners. Okay, all right. Yeah, I'll reach out to the adjuster and see what's going on and see if I can push them a little bit. All right, thank you. I appreciate it. Yeah, you're welcome. If you need anything else, just let me know. Thanks, Brandy. You're welcome. Bye.
