Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Hi, Heather. My name is Ashley with Van Dyke Mortgage. I was calling to see if you have that evidence of insurance available today for the McDowls. Oh, I do, girl. Yes. I am so sorry, I haven't got that over to you. No, if you could, that's all I'm waiting on to get this back into underwriting since they're trying to close lately. Yeah, that's all I need. Yeah, me and um, Tina have been back and forth over the weekend. Um, actually just coming back off a vacation today, so and I just had a client leave. I've been spending like an hour and a half with him, and every time I go to do it, some calls are coming in. I completely understand. Yes, ma'am. You are on my list, and I will get that over to you here in just a few minutes, son. Okay. Thank you. That's all. Thank you so much. You are welcome. Bye.
