Hey Amber, I'm trying to get hold of the commercial team for a commercial auto quote. I'm working on. I'm getting ready to issue. Alrighty, got the right department. Can I have your name? Perfect, Corbin Dirks. You want that quote number with Alliance Insurance six two three seven eight. Sorry, I'm in a rush. No, that's right. I got the. I'm ready for the quote number. CA one one four two three three six two five. What's going on with it? I think I got everything correct. He's just saying we need to file something for him or his hauling business with the state. Is that automatic? Ready to tell you guys to do that or. You just added into the quote. If you're still in the quote on your end, I can direct you to where to add it. I'm in there. Okay, so on the business tab, it's the page that's right before. I'm getting to the coverages. It usually is asking questions about his proof of prior insurance. And I believe it also has email. So if you're on that page and you scroll to the bottom. It'll say, "Does this policy need state or federal filings, or federal or state filing?" There any additional premium for that? There's a thirty five dollar fee usually. What state is it for? North Carolina. North Carolina. Let me see what their fee is. It's a one time fee though. It's not you know like a. A thousand. Constant one. Yep, thirty five for state filing. Yes, so once you click yes, it so it goes. However many filings you add, so if he's adding a federal and a state, it's thirty five for each one. But if he's only adding one, then it's just that one time thirty five dollar. So when I check. And that gets added onto the down payment. Y'all automatically notice then it's a state or not. Is there another place? There's another page, so you want to hit continue. And that's where it's going to ask you if the quote includes any owned or operated or all owned and operated vehicles for the business. If it does not, we would not be able to submit that filing. Or he would just need to add those other vehicles on there. So even if it's a vehicle that's parked or a vehicle that is you know down for maintenance, it needs to be listed on the policy for us to have those filings active. So when to add his personal vehicles on there or one of them or all of them or. So is the policy in his company name or in his name? Business name. Business name. Okay, is are the other vehicles owned by his business? No. Um. Does he use it to operate for his business? No. Okay, then no. So the only vehicles I need to be on there ones that he owns that he may lease or rent to use for his business or if he has a driver that he hires and that driver's using their own vehicle. That's what we want to see listed on the policy. Okay. So if I hit no there, she fine then. If you hit no, it's not going to let you add those filings. If you say that those aren't listed on the policy. Oh, gotcha. I see what you're saying. So does hit the federal MCS ninety in a state all three. Does he need the federal? And I ask him. I'm pretty sure it does. I'll, I'll make sure. Yeah, definitely double check with him if he needs it. But yeah, you would check off whichever ones you need. Once you check the state, it's going to ask you specifically which one. So it'll say liability, cargo. So that we can know which filing needs to be sent over. Alrighty, thank you so much. You have the one. Alright, you're so welcome. You too. Bye bye now.
