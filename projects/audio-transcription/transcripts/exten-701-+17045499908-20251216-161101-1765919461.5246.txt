Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance. This is Jeremy. How can I help you? Hi Jeremy, this is Ellie with Auto Owners returning a phone call. How are you doing? I am outstanding, Ellie. How are you doing? I'm good, just getting through the day. And it's not like minus a hundred outside today. That's true. It is a little bit nicer. Quite as bad, not quite as bad. Thank you so much first of all for giving me a call back. I really do appreciate it. Of course. I need some insight from you on two separate issues completely. But not really an issue, just questions if you will. There is a home a customer has brought to me that is a log cabin. It is built in 1915. But it completely got complete upgrades for all the things. The roof is 2023. And it's it's a metal roof, and then they've done medical medical good grief electrical and plumbing. Within the last 10 years, does have break. It's got all the normal qualifying factors. Okay. For traditional stove at home, I'm just trying to determine is that an area where Auto Owners is okay with the age of the home before I try to go through this process. Or what are your thoughts there? Um. So generally yes, um we just would need would either need the RCE to be under vintage replacement, or we do offer it to be. Quoted or run, I guess through the RCE as standard replacement, and then we offer something called functional replacement, which means in the case of a total loss, we would replace the building. To today's standard instead of vintage replacement, so like using today's log materials instead of sourcing something that from. Like a log from 1915. Does that make sense? It does. It does. And what is that particular coverage called? That last one. So that would be you would run the RCE in standard construction, which I believe is just the normal RCE. Although I double check that it would be up at the top in the middle of the page. I don't know if it defaults to vintage when it's earlier than 1940 or not. But it would be run in standard replacement cost, and then on the actual policy change. On the same screen under information where the RCE and coverage J is all listed, you would just select yes for functional replacement cost. Functional replacement cost. Okay, because I think that's what they currently have with State Farm now. And because I was reading over their deck pages and it did say something along those lines, not that exact verbiage, but something similar to where it would be replaced with. Like materials, you know, more I don't I don't even want to misquote it, but anyhow. Yeah. That's why I was asking a little bit more about that for pricing. Okay, that's excellent. That's that's good. And is that a standard with Auto Owners or is that a North Carolina only type answer you're giving me? That I don't know. Every state is so different. I'm only trained in North Carolina, so I'm not sure if it's like that. I would assume that it's like that in other states, but don't quote me. Okay. No, no problem. No problem. Sorry, that was a very random question. There's a question in there. The second thing I had a question on is I have a client, another prospect that I was working to quote with you guys on the auto side. And they have like a small claim of 400, and then there's a larger accident claim. And I was trying to, I was having somebody trying to communicate to your underwriter. To determine if we could get an exception because they're an ideal type client like their score is a 913 or something in the insurance score on the home side. Um. And it came. They they answered back and said it looks like they didn't qualify for the standard rating, and I was curious is that because. Of the accident that it it it affects their insurance score. I I don't know if I'm asking makes this point. Yeah. If I'm understanding what you're asking correctly, we have three different programs. So we have the owners, which is like our top tier premier program, and then we have Auto Owners Premier and Auto Owners Standard. And there's different eligibility guidelines for each of those programs. So generally, if they've had like an at fault accident where there was payout for property damage or bodily injury, they're not eligible for the owners program. But they might be eligible in the the standard program. But it also looks at what like date the accident took place because if it if there's an at fault accident within the last 12 months, then it's not eligible for any of the programs. That must be what it
