Hey, I got a message at two forty-two to call back. Yes, I'm looking at some of the forms. There's some stuff missing and a signature on one of the forms. Is it something I need to sign? Yes. Can you mail it to me and just let me mail it back? Um, if I do that, I won't get it back in time because I need to turn it in within three days. Because our mail won't go out till Monday here, we've already been been to the mail. And then you may not get it till Wednesday, and then like it'll be too late. I mean, I guess I can come Tuesday morning again. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. I'm sorry. And like I said, we're here at eight thirty. It'll I'll have it marked where you need to sign. Yeah, okay. It's just it's just me fighting the crowd on Tuesday morning. I did. That's why I wanted to work remote. I didn't want to have to come out. Yeah. So okay, if you I guess if you drop it in the post office, it wouldn't be time. You need it in three days. So I'll see you Monday morning sometime after eight thirty. Okay. Um, or I mean, I can. Tuesday morning. Tuesday morning. I'm sorry. I can I can meet you halfway too because I have to drive up to Winston myself. Um, I just either way, either way, whatever whatever's convenient. I'm not hard to get along with. Okay. All right. Yeah, then let's shoot for Tuesday morning eight thirty. If you can make it here. At the same office, right? Yes, yes. Okay. I'll be there Tuesday morning. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye bye.
