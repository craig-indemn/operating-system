Good, good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hi, I was calling. I made a change to my policy a couple weeks ago. I was just checking to see. When the I think they said since I was on the verge of having a new policy that they were going to be reimbursing me the difference and I'm not sure if it's just going to be applied my next payment is like next week so I don't know just check in. Okay, we'll give me one moment and I'll get an agent that can help. Thank you. You're welcome.
