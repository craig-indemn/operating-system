Sorry for your hold. This is Cody. Can help you. Cody, how are you doing? Good morning. Good morning. Who? This is Juan. The bus installation. Yes, sir. How are you? Good. I called you because I checked my cone and the bank, and they charged me the insurance. They charged you the insurance. Yeah, and you remember we already canceled. Well, I submitted the cancellations. If there was a bill that was about to get auto drafted, that might have still drafted, but once they cancel that one, they'll refund you any money that is owed to you. Okay. When? Because they charged me thirty seven dollars. Because I don't, I don't think you want to be charging me. I don't got enough money in the bank. Hold on just a minute. That's what I need to call you because they charged me thirty seven dollars. What company charged you? It's a force community loan. Oh, they charge you because it's for insufficient funds. Yeah, because supposed to be, they didn't charge me any more money and and not enough money in the bank. That's what I call you because you say you refund that, but the thing is they. I got enough money. For an insufficient funds fee, yeah, you're right. Hold on just a minute here. I thought, did they actually take the payment out? Yeah. Yeah, sometimes there's a delay between the time that they process the cancellation and depending on when the draft is, that can potentially cause problems. Hold on just a minute here. Trying to get your policies pulled up. Do you know what company it was that drafted? That much. You don't know. Let me check in the cone the bank. In Cova. In Cova. Nine A. Yeah, it must have just crossed because it canceled the same day that it drafted, so it probably drafted right before they processed the cancellation. No, because of course you. Yes, I understand. Well, I understand, but when I submit cancellations to the company, it takes a little bit of time before they actually process the cancellation. So I sent the cancellation form. The same day that the cancellation, the draft was because it had already drafted that morning. When I, because I submitted at eight thirty. That morning, but the payment had drafted the same time. It had already drafted that morning when you you requested that cancellation. Because that's what I call you only that way that they don't give me. I don't want. I don't got any problem that later. Right. I understand, but sometimes you know these things can't be prevented if it's already drafted when we submit the cancellation to the company because they canceled it. I sent the cancellation form to them at eight twenty seven in the morning, and they had it canceled within thirty minutes of me sending that policy that cancellation form to them. So they had already drafted for that payment before we even submitted the cancellation form. When I talked to you the day before that. Let me see. Yeah, unfortunately, one of these situations is not much that we can do when it's set up on auto draft, and the day that you call to cancel is the draft day. They canceled it when we got it canceled as quickly as we possibly could. But they had already drafted that payment that morning before I sent them that form. Just a second. I'm trying to pull up the. Yeah, so I had sent that to you on Friday, but then you didn't sign it until Saturday. So the earliest I could get it sent into the company was on Monday, which I did at eight twenty seven in the morning as soon as I got here. And so I sent that into the company, but nine eight which was Monday was your draft day too. Yep, because when you send me the, when you hear in Saturday morning, it was Friday. Yeah, I sent you. I sent you the cancellation form Friday at two fifty seven or so. No, you said when I hit when I got my my phone here, they is gonna be here late in the Saturday morning on Friday. I sent it Friday, which is why you got it again on Saturday because it sends it again every day. So you sent Friday and I signed it myself and filled it out on Friday, but then when I when you signed it, it was Saturday. And then as soon as I got in the office on Monday, I sent it into the company. So there's not much that I can do in the situation. It's just really bad timing on when your draft was. So you want to give me back my money or what do you want to do? In Cova will refund your money that you paid to them. The overdraft fee there's there's not much that we can do about that. But the money that was taken out from In Cova will be refunded back to you. You should just put it directly back into
