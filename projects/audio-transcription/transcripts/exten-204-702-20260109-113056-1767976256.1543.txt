Hey Miss Rachel. Hey Joe, how are you? I'm wonderful. Hope you are. Yeah. Mario, yeah I heard in the background. Oh yeah. Okay. Wait a minute. I'm gonna give you him the phone. Okay. Hey good morning sir, how you doing? Mario, I'm doing great. How are you? Okay, we just finished signing all the paperwork in the attorney's office. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. So, they they asked me to come over. I told them if I need to come over here and we're gonna do the thing, but. How does this work now? Do I care here with you now? Here with the lady or. No. Make an appointment with me or what. No Rachel Rachel won't be involved. She's great, but she won't be involved. But we can take care of it today. Let me confirm a couple things and I walk you through it. So your best phone number to be contacted is eight one eight seven seven four twenty two thirty three. Is that correct? Yeah, that's the number you can reach me at. Yeah. Okay. And then. But you can always call the office number. What's the office number? Three three six three five one eighty seventy one. Okay. Yeah, I remember talking to Sam. Yeah. And then is your email Mario? Toman at Yahoo. Yeah. So what we'll what we'll do because you're there, I'm here, and I'm anyway, we can do it all electronically. Okay. Don't worry about it. We'll walk you through it. Okay. Now do you know? We I know we haven't talked about it in a little while. Do you know if you want to set up a payment plan or do you want to do a one time payment on it? Or have you decided? The way is the for the whole whole. Thing is like a. Think it was one thousand eight hundred. Yeah, let me look again, Mario. Because I I won't remember now. Now do if you I do remember when we talked I think last time they're giving you that that short policy so you can get some of those updates done that we talked about and then they'll revisit. The building is already workable. I mean the the little stuff that I'm doing is just to make it a little bit more TLC, make it a little bit pretty. I'm not walking, I'm not throwing any walls down or nothing like that. So. Well, you got you got to do some stuff right. Then you say you were planning on maybe doing some some roof work or you got to put glass in. Yeah. Those are light. Yeah, those are all light stuff. That's already that's not an an issue. Because we already got the quotes, we already got everything done on that. It's just seeing it put together. Okay. So here's here's what I'm looking at. Is it is eighteen hundred? That's twelve ninety for the property itself and then for the live building, right? The general live building is going to be five ten. So collectively, we're looking at eighteen hundred bucks on a three month policy. It's only nine or excuse me ninety day policy. So what we need to agree on and make sure we both stay engaged is within ninety days. Let's follow up. I'll be glad to come by the shop. Touch base, give me an update of everything that you did do. Hey now that it's occupied now that I've done some repairs but maybe light or medium or whatever those are updates. Let's resubmit for a long term a year long policy. We can do that that shouldn't be a problem. Okay. And it'd be a lot cheaper. I think it'd be a lot more affordable. I do especially since somebody's gonna be in there you know daily or often. Right. Daily. Yeah. And then we need to also talk about speaking of you know cheaper or leveraging your your policies and your money. We need to have that conversation about the towing business. What you're what you're doing in there? Can we combine it and make it one broader policy? Not right now because I'm still on the contract with the the people I'm with. So there's nothing I can do there yet. No, no, I understand that we we just need to have that conversation. Hey, what does this look like moving forward? Yes, down the road we'll do that. Okay. Yeah. But right now I got step by step. Yeah I'm with you. I'm not gonna be jumping. Things right now because I have things I have to make sure I I have the money for everything. No, I'm I'm with you. We're in for the long game. We're not a three month and done. No, we're we're gonna be partnering for years. That's the intent. Okay. The idea.
