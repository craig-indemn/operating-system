But what I'm doing is they're gonna they're gonna uh uh buy my the 2023 Subaru Outback. They're gonna buy that off the lease. So that they'll take that. Then I'm getting tomorrow a new Volvo. And I just need to what what I need to do to make sure I'm insured etc. Yeah, I'm gonna um. Let's see, I'm gonna go ahead and do the policy change to auto owners. Okay, yes, I figured. I mean, I know we're about to change everything, but I know I'm trying to think. I mean, technically we could because your vehicle is insured up to like seven days. You know when you purchase a new vehicle, you have like they give you like seven days to get that traded switch to the policy. So yeah, actually your insurance is gonna cover you. I'm just even trying to think. Should we even pull with auto owners? Um, because we're we're gonna bond your policy on the 26th, right? Is that what we decided on? Um, so we're actually we're not gonna so our actual move now is not gonna be until the um. We're gonna close on October 8th. Okay, all right. So we will. We need to keep all your policies on the same date then, right? Yeah, I think I mean I do think that makes no sense. Yeah. Gotcha. So we do need then if it's yeah oh oh yeah the 8 October 8. It's gonna do the new policy right. Yeah, so all yeah so I want to yeah do that Cincinnati package with all of them. Yeah, yeah. Let me go ahead and get that added from you or swapped out.
