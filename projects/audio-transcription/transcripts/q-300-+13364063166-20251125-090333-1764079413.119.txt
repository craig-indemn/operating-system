Thanks for holding. This is Addison. Addison, this is Jerry Mason. I've had insurance on four cars for a few years, and all of a sudden I looked on the app this morning, and it says two vehicles insured. And I paid fifteen hundred dollars, fifteen hundred dollars, no number to ten. Now I don't know why one of my vet and Mercedes is not covered. We talked. I talked to Cecilia. On October about Haggerty insurance, but we never got bid anything. I don't know who authorized this. I did. Now here I am. What? Over two weeks without auto insurance on these two cars, and they're going to come get my tag. Okay, let me get you pulled up and see what's going on. Give me just a second. Okay, it looks like that Haggerty policy was written. Let me pull up the application. What policy was written? The Haggerty policy. The Haggerty policy. Yes, sir. I'm seeing a 2001 Chevrolet and a 1996 Mercedes both on the Haggerty policy. So where's the bill? Let me find out. Man. I'm pulling up the policy to see if anything's been sent out. Usually they'll send you something in the mail, but let me double check. Okay, I paid fifteen over fifteen hundred dollars, no number to ten. Six months ago, the premium was fifteen seventy eight. Well, I just thought I got just a shade better deal. I wonder if I included in that. Yeah, so the fifteen hundred that you paid that was for National General, and those are for the 2021 Ram and the 2023 Hyundai. So I had four cars at fifteen seventy eight. Now I've got two cars for fifteen hundred. When you talked to Cecilia about the Haggerty policy, did she have you sign an application or anything? I didn't. I don't recall signing anything. Okay, this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to get in touch with her. I'm going to give her a call and figure out what exactly is going on, and I'm going to call you back. Is that okay? That'll be fine, Addison. I appreciate it. I've been too long for this to be going on with me. Yeah, but I do see that there two there are two active policies. So you are not uninsured. All vehicles are covered right now, but I'm just going to figure out the billing part of that and I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, thank you, Addison. Bye.
