Hello. Hey, Courtney. It's Jeremy at Alliance Insurance. Hi, Jeremy. Good, good, good, good. So, I got you some numbers. Okay. All right. So, with the auto side, it would be one hundred. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Your armada. Did you have anything but liability on it? Yeah, it paid off. That's all you had, right? Yeah. Okay, all right. Yeah, sorry, I got thrown off there. I let my eyes jump to a different sheet here. I was on the wrong notes. No wonder that ain't you. All right, here we are. So basically, it would be about one hundred and twenty dollars a year cheaper. With the company that I have, National General. What that would look like monthly is it'd be like seventy-three bucks down, seventy-three dollars a month. On the auto. Okay. And in turn, that gives us a discount to write your rental property there at Oliver's Crossing to where that price for the year would be. Eight hundred ninety-two dollars and eighty-five cents. That sounds a shit some lot better than what I've been paying. Yeah, I mean, so basically, I'm only going to save you seventeen hundred dollars a year. So seventeen hundred. Only seventeen. The only thing I would need on the auto is the. Can I get windshield? Yeah, you can. It would be one hundred dollars deductible. It goes fault underneath comprehensive. Okay. And with one hundred dollars deductible, let me see how much it's going to change your. Did you pay monthly on that? You said. On what the car? Yeah, on the car. No car's paid off. No, no, your car insurance. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so it'd be about eighty-nine dollars down, eighty-nine dollars a month to put the windshield on there and be one hundred dollars deductible. That's also going to cover fire, theft, vandalism, and hail. And turkey and deer. Okay, I want that. All right. So the. That's pretty much what I'm paying right now. Yep, and you're going to have better coverage there because they increased your property damage from fifty thousand to one hundred thousand. In that price, that protects you better. For if that armada was to hit a brand new truck and totaled, your current liability is only fifty thousand wouldn't be enough and they could sue you. So we're trying to keep that from happening. What happened? Again. All right. If you're Nissan, hit a brand new truck and you were at fault and it totaled. Your current property damage liability is fifty thousand dollars. That's not going to buy a new truck. And basically, someone will be able to sue you because you didn't have enough insurance. However, the property damage on my quote is one hundred thousand dollars for that scenario to put you in a better position to be insured properly. And like, what would happen if so? Is this like insurance like in case somebody was to hit my car and like if I was in the parking lot and someone hit my car and. Their insurance should pay that. Yeah, but if it was like a hidden one, it would be my insurance, right? If you had collision on it, it would be. But you don't have collision. We're only so comprehensive on there. Okay. Okay. And just curious, how much more for collision? If I put collision on there, normally what they do is a five hundred dollars deductible with collision because normally that's assuming you're at fault for an accident. But if I set it with a five hundred dollars deductible, let me see what that would change all this to for you. So that'd make it one hundred and seventeen dollars a month. Okay. No, I think comprehensive too is enough for me. Okay. Liability. You got it. All right. So this would be set up on an auto face for like a credit card or checking account. Which one do you need here for you? Do it on my credit card. Okay. And. Okay, which credit card are you using for us? Oh, you're fine. You're fine because I'm still going through some screens right here. Also, like, so it's changing companies for action. So I won't be on Progressive anymore. Yeah, and you're just going to call Progressive and let them know. Um, to cancel your coverage effective today, I guess or whatever day. Yeah, you can call them and tell them cancel. You know what? I'd wait till tomorrow. I would tell them, yeah, I would call them tomorrow and tell them, hey, cancel my insurance effective today. Whenever you call them tomorrow, and that just gets reimbursed me. Yeah, it should be a pro-rated amount that they send back to you. For that, basically because you're going to have some that
