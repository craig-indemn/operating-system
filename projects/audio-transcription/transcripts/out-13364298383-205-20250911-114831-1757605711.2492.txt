Hello. Mildred. Hey. Hey, ma'am, it's Joe at Alliance Insurance. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm I'm good. I just touched base with Frank and he wanted me to make sure to call you and line something up. Just want to see if I could come by and meet you this afternoon. Got a couple options for you on the renewal. Just want to show you what you got and go from there if you had time today. What time were you thinking? I've been sick all day. Oh bless your heart. Well, it's just my arthritis, you know. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm flexible. I only got one other appointment today. I'm just doing paperwork, housework as they call it. So whatever's good, whatever's good for you should be good for me. Um, it would probably be best about let's say four just to give me enough time to get ready and everything. Yeah, that'll be fine. You'll be come by the shop or meet you somewhere else. Well, um, maybe it would be best if I come to you. Yeah, that'll be fine. You know we're right across from the Y. Yes. Yeah. Frank showed me the other day. I don't think Frank wants Mark to know all the figures and everything. Yeah, yes, the impression he just gave me. He said because I've called the shop. Well, I guess it's the shop the six six three zero number. Is that over? Yeah, yeah. He said I thought Mildred's handling that. I said yes, she is. I was just calling. He said, "Yeah, just call her, let her handle it." I said, "Okay." I said, "There ain't no problem. Yeah, I'm gonna get her to handle it. Yeah, okay, well come on by." Okay, I'll be there. Are you coming from home? Are you coming from home? Yeah, well you know we're up here to light at eighty nine. And yeah, Frank showed me the other day. Okay, well I'll have I'll have some paperwork laid out for you. Just come on in. We'll see you when you get here. All right, thank you. Thank you. Take care. You say.
