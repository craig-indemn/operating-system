Thank you for holding this, Heather. Hey, Heather. This is Safa Cordypong. How are you doing? Good. How are you? I'm doing well. Wanted to call and update one of the cars on our auto policy. Okay. I get your account pulled up. How was your Christmas and New Year's? It was pretty good. Good. Yeah. Nothing. Nothing too big. Nothing too crazy. That's good sometimes. Yeah, staying. My father he's been sick, so he lives in North Myrtle Beach. So of course I have been down there dealing with that, but you know it's it's one of those things happens in life. So yeah, that's what I'm dealing with right now. But we're we're gonna get there. Let's see. We still have you as National General for your auto. Yeah. All right. It's kind of a new thing. I wanted to ask you about that car sir. I couldn't remember. Yeah. What we had in place. I think last time was this. We paid up front. Maybe we can go ahead and do that again. Okay. Let's see. So now you replace a vehicle. Yes. Yeah, we replace a vehicle. We did replace. Have to get logged in there, and everything. Now you have to do like a two-step verification process. It's like a like a with the multi-factor authentication. Okay. So yeah, your policy it doesn't renew until the 25th of January. But if you want, you can go ahead and pay that. But let's make this change first. Since that needs to be before the 25th. Let's see. So is are we making this effective today? Effective today is one two. January the second. So you purchased it on Friday. Okay. Okay, which vehicle did you replace? Yes, we replaced the Mazda. The Mazda 2023, the X. Okay. All right, and do you have the VIN number for your new vehicle? Yes, it is. Five, and as a Nancy, M as an Mary, T as an Penguin, Five, D as an David, G as an Duke, One, Three, T as a Tom, H as an Happy, Zero, Eight, Two, Nine, Six, Three. All right, and that is a 2026 Hyundai Santa Fe. Yes. Okay. Now is this vehicle being driven every day back and forth to work? Oh yes, that's that's an old vehicle. All right, and we're keeping the same coverage right as what you had. You've got 100, 000, 300, 000 for bodily injury, and then 100, 000 for property damage. Medical payments is a thousand. Same thing for uninsured underinsured bodily injury is 100, 000, 300, 000, and the uninsured motorists property damage is 100, 000. Your comprehensive is a hundred dollar deductible, and your collision is 500. To 500 deductible. You also have the rental transportation expense and roadside assistance. Yes. Okay. Is it possible to take off roadside assistance just for him or no? Uh huh. It is. It's it's only like maybe like 10 for the year. But if you guys don't need that, we definitely can do. I can take that off. Do y'all have triple A? No, we have we have BlueLink through Hyundai for 36 months. So. Oh okay. Okay. Yeah, that's all right. So. So you don't need it on any vehicles, right? I would still need on my my BlueLink expired. Oh okay. So just the 2026, you don't need it on. Correct. Okay. It's not letting me. I'll have to go back in and remove that. It's going to ask me to do a separate transaction. So bear with me one second. Okay, and you do need rental is that right? You just want to remove the roadside assistant. Or do you? I would leave that. Let's leave the rental for now. I hope we don't check with him. Okay. Making a change later will be too difficult, right? No, not at all. We can do that anytime, hon. If you don't need it. Okay, so it's they said that the balance due now is fifteen dollars and ninety six cents. So that's pro rated to add this new vehicle on. So for this term, it's just an additional fifteen dollars and ninety six cents. Okay. No, you can go ahead and pay that if you want, or you can wait. They will bill you. It's up to you. Did you do you want to go ahead and pay for both of them or you just wanted? What do you want to pay, hon? Today. Oh, just the balance. Just the fifteen. Okay, all right. Yeah, and then since your other one isn't due until the twenty fifth, they're going to send you a new renewal since we made these changes. Okay. Okay, and then you can you can call us in and we can take that payment. But you will receive a new one if you've already received one. You'll get a separate one showing that the new vehicle is added. All right. So the remaining balance on this term is fifteen ninety six. Do you have a card or a check? I have a card. I can use the information. Okay. What kind of card is it? It is a master card. Master card. All right, hon. What's that number? Five three one two. Five seven zero zero. Two four six six. Eight seven five two. That would through seven twenty eight. Yeah, five nine two. Five nine two. Okay, and then the billing zip code is that two seven zero one two. Two seven zero one two. And is this a debit or a credit card? It's a debit card. Debit card. All right, hon. That's fifteen dollars and ninety six cents. All right, Seth. Of course, there anything else that you need today? I don't believe so. You don't need any information, I guess, from what the dealer gave us. No, that's done. Yeah, I can do all that verbally. The phone system. Thank you for that. All right. Uh huh, you're welcome. Let me know if you have any questions once you get your renewal. Do you want to take a look at that? Just give me a callback, or otherwise we can just take a payment. Okay. Actually, I do have one of the questions. Sure, the homeowners. Policy that we have. I do see that it. Believe it's gone. Up. I was wondering. Yeah, they again. We're still seeing those rate increases. If you've not filed a claim, nothing has changed. It's typically the just the general rate increase. But let me log in and see. Let me take a look at it while I have you. Have you guys did any home improvements or anything? Over the year, this past year. You haven't did anything like replaced your roof or anything like that. Everything is the same. Everything's the same on the inside. We did put irrigation in the backyard. Okay. All right. And you didn't file a claim this year. No. And also, renewal is on the twenty fifth. All right, so it says. So this is what changed. I know that you saw the increase, but the coverage A amount. Which along with coverage A, if it adjusts, then all the other coverages are going to adjust accordingly. It's a percentage based off of your dwelling amount. And so last year we insured your home at five hundred eighty four thousand nine hundred. That was the replacement cost. So they bumped it to six hundred and forty seven thousand five hundred dollars. So it it did take a pretty significant increase. But that's primarily like I said the inflation, just the general rate increase that they're like I said last year we insured it. At five eighty four nine and now this year they're saying they had to adjust it, the replacement cost. And now your home is being insured at six hundred and forty seven thousand five. And that's the only thing I'm showing. There was no claim filed. It's just saying that the statewide rate increase affected this along with the inflation, the replacement cost, the adjusted value factor. We can look at because it went from it was twelve ninety. Your premium was last year and this year it's sixteen forty four. So it went up twenty seven percent. We can look at. Let's see. I can run the quote your auto quote through AutoOwners too to see if we can bundle them together this time around. I think AutoOwners was a lot higher before when we tried to So if we bumped it to 5,000 on your renewal, it's gonna reduce it by 216 dollars. So it's your new premium would be 1428. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'm sorry. What did you say on? You said 1428, right? 1428 would be your new premium. Okay. It's gonna shave off 216 dollars. And if you want to think about it, that's fine. If you want to talk it over with your husband. Yeah, yeah, I will do that. I'll get back to you. Okay, all right. So I'm just gonna leave it at the end right now. We're still gonna I'm not gonna make any changes. Okay. And then if I will it'll stay like that at the 2500, unless we hear back from you. Is that okay? Yes, that's fine. Okay. I do know you were mentioning going to shop the auto owners for the auto policy. I remember that he had that DUI and I wasn't sure if that was part of the reason. Yeah, it was. Do you remember? Do you remember how long ago that was? I can go back and look if you. It'll be three years ago on January 13th. Oh, okay. Let's see. Okay, yeah, because that was 12 points. So I know National Auto Owners is gonna be extremely high. I knew there was something. That's why I was like usually National General. We put you there because they're very competitive. Whenever for people that have this type thing on their record. Because that was 12 points, so that's still on there. I don't want you to waste your time doing it. Thank you. Yes, I appreciate it. Um and so I show that the this happened on January 13th and there was an accident involved in that too. Um. Now that has the accident you're not getting charged with any longer because it was three points. Um. But they they show zero on that, but then the 12 points come from the actual DWI. Um and they've got the conviction date of 112823. But it occurred on January the 13th. Yeah. So I can still check on that and see. Most of how these fall off after three years. But with the DWI and reckless driving, sometimes they last for five years, just depending. But I will definitely check on it for you. But hopefully. Um. Let's see. Have you received your renewal yet for the auto policy? We did. Did it come down? No, it went up. Okay. So it's probably still being charged. Because that's what I'm showing. It's still 12 points on there. For Reginald, yeah. So I bet I bet that won't fall off then. And. I'm gonna reach out to National General and see how long they charge you for that. Because like I said, standard standard points just like you know just a speeding violation or something like that is normally three years. But I think with the severity of this, like the 12 points, is stays on five. I think, but I'm not 100 certain. So I'm gonna reach out to National General and then. But yeah, I know what that auto owners is gonna be high. Yeah. Um. Yours is 1926. The renewal. What did you pay last year? Oh. Let us go there again. Let's see. Well, I'm sorry because we just added that vehicle. It was. Yep. It was only like 25 dollars. Yeah. Okay. Well, because it was 1625 and it went to 1651. So yeah, it's still on there. But yeah, since we the new vehicle cost a little bit more. Let's see. 1926. 1926. It was 1645 last year, and then before the new vehicle, what was it again? Before we added a new vehicle, it just went up to 16. 1651. So not a big difference. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Yeah. So I'll still I've got Progressive that I can quote it through too. I can quote that dear auto through Progressive and then I'll check auto owners as well. Okay. Perfect. Okay. All right. Thank you. And I will be back in touch. Yes, you are welcome, Hun. Good to hear from you guys. I'm glad to hear you're doing well. So. Um. But yeah, I will be back in touch. Give me like a day or two to get all those quotes ran and I'll let you know what I find out. Everything's still the
