Hello. Hi, is Junior available? Yes, speaking. Hi, it's Tracy calling from Alliance Insurance. How are you? Yes, Tracy, I'm doing good. How are you doing? I'm doing good. Thanks. I got your voicemail message and you wanted to get that policy started. Yes, you sent me the quote. The only question I have, you know, it's a nice modular home and all, and I didn't realize we went without insurance for that long and the mortgage company didn't even catch it. I'm gonna call them on that too, but that's all on me. I was going through a hard time, and now I'm trying to get everything in order. But um, I like I like I like what I got. You know I like the price and everything. It's just the insurance a little bit higher than I was expected. Yeah, unfortunately, it does go higher on a mobile home, especially when it's in a suburban area. Oh yeah. So that really drives it. Okay, what does the term insurability mean? See, there's a just as an example. Let's see, there's a weak board on your porch and. Male person stops by and their foot goes through that thing and it breaks their leg. They could sue you. Yeah. And that would fall under negligence. Yeah, so that 500, 000 would protect you. Oh, okay, okay. Good image was higher than that. Yeah, it's a little property, so I need that. Yeah, oh definitely, yeah definitely. Okay, that sounds good. Okay, did you want to do paying full? You want to do an auto draft. I want to do an auto auto draft. Hold on, give me one second, please. Somebody's calling me. I need to get that. Okay. Yep. Oh yes, yes. Okay. And did you want to do the semi annual like you're doing on your other policies? Do you want to do monthly quarterly? What did you want to do on that? Quarterly, how much the semi annual would want me to? Let me see. Because I sometimes I forget to pay insurance and that's where the problem was. If I do a semi annually, it'd be a lot less. You know to worry about. Yeah, um, we could do set it on the semi annually. It would be 625 down to start it today, and then. Let's do that. Okay. And do you have your routing and account number? Yes, I surely do. Okay, I'm ready for that whenever you are. Okay, and then just give me the information about um you will send me all the information with the policy number and all that right. I sure will. I'll send you a copy of the declarations page and I'll send you a copy of your receipt too and I'll send it to you through your email so that you can electronically sign the application. Okay. Yes. And then you'll be good to go. Okay, so it's two five three for the routing number one seven seven nine eight four. Nine eight four. Yes. Okay, and the account number including any leading zeros. One four one zero zero zero two seventy two forty three. Okay, and how is your name on this? Junior theme. Family car holder. Okay, I will get this issued right now, and like I said, I'll email you the application for electronic signature. I'll include verification of insurance as well as a receipt for today's payment, and this will be set up on a draft and the next one will be June 21st. Let me write that down because then I'll forget we end up in a situation again. Oh no. 21st and and please have the other come out of other draft on my account, please.
