It's a great afternoon, lines insurance. This is Jamie. And Jamie, can you give me the VIN number for that car? Yes, sir. Or you want to just include it in your email? I can do that for you. If that'd be easier, I literally just type an email. As, as. Yeah, maybe why don't you send that to me because I'm going to need to. Think I'm going to need that for the body shop or whatever. I will email to you. I'll do that. Okay. All right, thank you. Bye bye. Thank you. Bye bye.
