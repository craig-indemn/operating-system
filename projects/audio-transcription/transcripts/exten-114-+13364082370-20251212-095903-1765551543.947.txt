Yeah, we got some checks back from I guess our auto owners. One I know is the escrow payment. I think it was auto owners. Yeah, the escrow payment. So I've talked to my lender. So I know I need to contact them and somehow coordinate getting that money back to the escrow account so they can. So they can. Yeah, they can guide you on what to what exactly they want you to do with that portion. Yeah, yeah, then I've got two checks and I believe they were for the auto policy which we paid for.

I'm gonna go get them. One was for like 1200 and one was for. Yes. I've got the 1200 for the auto. It's 1255. One for the auto.
