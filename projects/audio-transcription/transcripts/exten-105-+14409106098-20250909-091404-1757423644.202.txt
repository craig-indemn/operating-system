Good morning. This is Rick. Hi Rick. This is Chris Jacutis with Progressive Insurance. How are you? Good morning, Chris. Sometimes I hope you are. Oh yeah, pretty good. Sorry, I Mister Colic. We were playing phone tag there. I walked away from my desk for a second. You call me back. Sometimes sometimes, isn't it? It does. Yeah, exactly. Almost like every day. Hey well, hey thanks so much for your interest in our habitational product. I'd love to spend a few minutes going through the product itself, acceptability, and also to show you where the product guide is. Does it sound okay? I have a few minutes right now. Yes. Oh perfect. Okay, so go into four agents only if you can. One moment. Sure. Okay, Chris. Where should I be looking for here? Products. So once you're in go under, hover over products and then drop down to business owners and contractor GL. All right. And this should take you into our product guide, our product page. It does. And that page down page down a little bit where it says product guide and reference cards. You just have to put your state in there. I got you. And then it'll populate information on the right hand side. Okay. And I'm going to draw I'm going to draw your attention to the product guide first and then we have a one pager for habitational. So go into go ahead. That's fine. I see several links here once I select the state. So which one should I select here for this conversation? Go into yeah go into the product guide. I think it's a is it the second link. Yeah. First link maybe but that's okay. Okay. Oh I'm not following along because it has come with my system before so. So once you open the product guide, go to the second page which is the table of contents. And then go down where it says products and the last one should be habitational lessors risks. Okay one second I think maybe I'm missing that part of it. Well, see table of contents but I did not see business. There's lessors lessors slash habitational that's it. Yeah. Okay. I'm going in now. Finally, this my my system's working. Yeah. Everybody thought it was crazy last week when I said my system wasn't working and now theirs wasn't so now mine is. Yeah yeah that's that's good yeah that's sort of the underwriting guidelines and criteria that that we would be interested in sort of knowing what you're looking for and and it makes sense and I certainly see there's lots of information there that I can share with the team I think you know my quick take on it and this is pretty common Chris with carriers that are still exhibiting some appetite for this class of business is that you know the ITV runs out pretty fast you know five million dollars used to used to cover a pretty good size building and doesn't do so anymore so so that's crazy I know I'm hoping that we I'm hoping that we move up on that you know even even with the contractor stuff like the payroll I'm hoping that we like kind of boost that up a little bit so the habitationals like one to four family or we can do the one to four family with a mixed occupancy with an office or a retail space so a lot of times have apartments above an office or above a retail space that's something that we're doing as well but the one to four family seems to be really the the best things that we that we do really well go go back to that initial page where you put your product guide and reference cards and just hit back okay and the last link instead of the product guide is download the BOP North habitationals summary yeah see that and look at this go to the second page after the picture and everything in blue is what we do and everything in white is a DP three that we don't do so it's kind of comparing our product to a DP three so the nice thing is we'll do an LLC individual corporation or partnership we can go up to five million then it also tells you up to four units we can do four units per location up to four locations per policy so that's kind of nice we we don't like Airbnb's we they have to be thirty days or longer rentals and then it has some of the things that we do that an air that a DP three doesn't do like equipment breakdown lock replacement move back expenses employee dishonesty heating air conditioning loss reimbursement lack out or sales removal disposal of debris tenants' property legal liability increased costs of construction cyber water backup and sub pump overflow utilities to restrict damage and business income hired and non owned auto and optional coverages and the hired and non owned auto is nice if people you know have a somebody they drive around and checked on their properties and stuff you know that's kind of nice to have that and then the exclusions are the same tramp
