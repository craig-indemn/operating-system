This is Jessica. I'm going to help you. Ah, yes, Jessica. Do you do all quotes for our garage liability? We do. We do require our companies require two years of prior insurance. So it's like a new business. We wouldn't be able to provide a quote at this time. Okay. So you said two years. Yes. Okay. So. How long does it take to do a quote? So we would need your loss runs, which show that you've had two years of prior insurance with losses or without losses depending on your account. And then we take it to our company, and it could take up some minimum three business days up to a week depending on the underwriter's questions. Okay. So you need your loss runs. Uh, and something else as well. Just the loss runs, yeah, and then I mean we'd have a couple questions for you. You gave your deck pages, which is your declaration pages. I have your coverages. We could also get most of the information that we need off of that. Okay. All right. Now this is. Uh, I've had the one million, three million aggregate. Um. But then I had somebody inquire today. Did I want just liability? So why would I just want liability? What that would only cover somebody else. Versus. All the package. Why would somebody get just liability? So for garage insurance, there's a liability that's for the premise. So if I go in car shopping or getting my car fixed and I slip and fall, that's the general liability for me. And then you have the other garage liability, which is the liability that goes on the DMV tag. So if I'm test driving a car. What. Okay. Yeah, yeah. But what about when I'm what I'm saying? I'm accustomed to having the comprehension, uninsured, underinsured, physical, that kind of stuff. Like the full coverage. Yeah, but so why would a company just have liability? I guess it would be only. Well, I think it's on personal preference because not every dealership or garage carries. A full coverage or dealer's blanket as they call it for the vehicles that they're selling or working on. So that means if something happened to the vehicle, it's not covered. Correct. Yeah. They're paying for it as the owner. No, I don't. I don't know who would do that, but they ask me that. No. Okay. Yeah, I'm trying to figure that out. Okay, so. Where are you guys located? Uh, we we have a few offices. Um, I'm in Winston Salem on the University Parkway area in the Sam Smith shopping center. Okay. So I would need to. I would need to get that. Uh. You said something about the deck page or something. Yes, like a declaration page would have your your current coverages so we could see what you have there. Okay, so this is is too for renewal like right now. Okay, and what's the turnaround? You said hello. It could be minimum three days and then like up to a week if the underwriter has more questions. Okay, and I'm driving so I can't take all that. I'm just absorbing it in my head. If you'd like, I can send you an email and you could just email me back with the information. Yeah, that'd be fine. Yeah. Oh, let me give it to you. Go ahead. It's s and Sam M and Mary. At Montgomery Enterprise dot com. Montgomery. So would you need to do send an application as well? No, ma'am. We would just start with the loss runs in your deck page and then out from there. I could see what information I don't see on there and I could just send you those questions. Okay, so you guys do the application. Or me. I do. Actually, I'm sorry. Oh, I should have asked this before. What is the address of your dealership? Two eight one seven. Chisman Street. Charlotte NC eight two zero eight. Thank you. Okay. So it looks like it's beside a what is this a good good year? Yeah. And it's a mobile home is the office. And then the parking lot. It doesn't look like you share the location with anyone else. Is that correct? I'm on the other side. I'm on the suite B. I don't share with the office now. Uh, okay. Let me try to look for yours. Look what. You said you're on the other side, so it's not the mobile home office. Yeah. Is it? But it's it's it's two it's it's two suites. Oh, okay. So it's two dealerships in one office. No, it's not in one office. It's two different offices. Okay, maybe this picture is old because. Oh yeah, it
