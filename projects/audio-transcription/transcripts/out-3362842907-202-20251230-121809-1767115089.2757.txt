Hello. Hey James, this is Heather with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Fine, thank you. Good. I was calling to just give you an update. Tracy had reached out to travelers. There was a change in premium, and it was going to increase, with removing Carolyn. So, I requested that we waive the premium, and they just suggested that we wait until your renewal for the home and the auto, just to prevent any change in premium. To remove Carolyn, so they have that noted and are going to make that change closer to the renewal. And then on the progressive policy, I was able to remove her from. I think it was a motorcycle. Or golf cart. Yeah. We done got rid of the motorcycles long time ago. Oh well, we're we've still got an active policy. So let me look at that then. Yeah, we got rid of it. So, about six months ago, we took it up the. The place at crazy corner where they take all cars as, and they give you money for it. Okay. Sold it to them for three hundred bucks. I gotcha. I don't I don't know if if you guys called in to remove that. If not, then we need to get it canceled. Yeah. I don't know if he did or not. I don't know if she did or not. Yeah, this was a twenty thirteen gold wing, right? No, no, no, no, not that one. That was that. That was that. The Zuki Bergman she had. Okay, so the gold wing you still have then. Oh yeah, she's. Okay, okay, so we're good then. We're good. I just removed her from that one. But we'll leave this active. Well, I'm glad that we looked at it. So that progressive policy is taken care of. The auto and the home. Her name will be removed once we get closer to renewal. I just I don't ever want anybody to have to to pay more, you know, due to this scenario. So just wanted to to give you the heads up. I've noted this on our end. So if you do need anything, James, just let us know. Okay. Okay. Your man was here just about an hour ago. Who was? He looked at the vehicle out there and. Oh nice. Okay. What? Wasn't an adjuster. Yeah, the insurance adjuster whatever. Gotcha. He took a look at it and said, "It wasn't too bad, it's not." Okay, I will let Tracy know, and then otherwise, if you need anything, just let us know. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. Uh, bye.
