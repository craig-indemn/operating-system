Thank you for calling National General. This is Linda. How may I assist you? Hi there, Linda. Good morning. My name is Jamie. I'm an agent here with Wise Insurance. I don't know. What I'm looking for. I was just doing a renewal review with one of our existing clients, and the accident protection plan level one is on the policy. It's charging thirty dollars. The insurer has asked me. He's like, "Well, I'd like to know what that covers." And I said, and I went down the list, reading at it, you know, death, dismemberment, all that. He goes, "Well, can you can you send me something? I'd like to read through it." So my question to you, Linda, would be: Is there anywhere else portal that I would find like a cheat sheet? For that coverage that I could send to an insurer to explain what that does. The document should be in the policy. What's the policy number? It's two zero two five five zero six one three zero. The upcoming renewal is mod zero one. It's for Earl Pepper. Okay. I'm going to repeat the policy number that I wrote down because it's not coming up. I'm sorry. Let me get it back. Two two zero two. Okay. Five five zero six one three five. Three five. Okay, I had a zero. Yeah, it's a mod. It's a mod zero one. So he he doesn't have the auto protection plan, but he is wanting to know what it covers. No, he has it. I was just messing with it like in the. This is a long confusing story, but while I was on the phone with him adjusting deductibles, he wanted to find savings on the policy. So he asked me about canceling that coverage. And I told him he would have to sign a form and send it in. In order to delete it, he goes, "Well, maybe maybe if you just send me something to read on it, maybe I'll keep it." And I said, "Okay, I'll find you something to read." So, but I was scrolling. I'm looking through the renewal document here. I don't see it anywhere, and I don't know if y'all have whatever. Because I didn't. I didn't see that. Well, I accidentally deleted it. Nothing he has. He has life insurance and roadside assistance. He should have the accident protection plan on there. I was messing with it, and I accidentally deleted it. I didn't even know I could delete it, but I accidentally deleted cancellation of accident protection plan and insurer list. That was me. I made a mistake. And then I put it back. Right after I get it, so it's in there. Because usually, usually you can't. Yeah, I didn't think I could. I clicked on the left side of the portal as cancel accident protection plan. I thought that that was going to give me a form to sign, you know, similar like the statement of loss kind of tops it up, and then let me print it. I thought that's what it was going to do, but instead just deleted it. And then I kind of panicked. Then I put it back. I'm just looking through it, so just you know bear with me just a moment. In the. In the renewal accident protection declaration page, it should um in your renewal documents. The form is there. Let's see one one five three three is the endorsement. Usually it, and usually it has more. Information, so let's still look again. Let me go back and see if it was on. It shows something in the last year's term. Because they have a lot of definitions and all in it, but let's see. I found something. I went on. I found it. I found it. I went. So I went back to last year's term. In the bonded new business and in that one. Page six three. You have last term too. Okay. Yeah, yeah, he had last term. Okay. Okay. Sixty four, sixty five. All the way through. Okay. Okay, so I found it. Okay. All right. Um. Well, let me ask you this: as long as in the event that he wants to
