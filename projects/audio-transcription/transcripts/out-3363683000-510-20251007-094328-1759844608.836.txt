Good morning, Mr. Hills Hardware. How can I help you? What is Johnny available? Uh, hang on just a minute, okay? Thank you. You welcome. The person at extension one zero zero five is not available. Please leave your message after the tone. When finished, simply hang up or press the pound key. Hi, this is Tracy calling from Alliance Insurance. I just want to touch base with you about this possible claim. If you have a moment, please give me a call back. The number's three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. And I'm also just going to send you a quick email just in case that's more convenient. Again, it's Tracy and it's three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thanks so much. Bye bye.
