Sorry for your hold. This is Cody. I help you. Hey Cody, how are you? I'm good. How are you? Good. Thank you. This, okay. Oh, hey, how's that? You doing all right? Yeah. Yeah, sorry, I missed you yesterday. Tried to give you a call back earlier, but I didn't reach you. What's going on? Yeah, it's all right. So I was calling because Hugo asked me to call you. He has HTR installations with him. HTR installations. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so we've got the package and the workers' comp for HTR, correct? Yeah. And his question was, so he's going to have another crew this coming year. And it's impossible to use the same the same insurance the same workers' comp. What is he? So right now he's the lead installer for HTR and the owner of HTR, correct? Right. Yeah. So he's he's going to get another another crew. Oh, like he wants to run a second crew under his business. Yeah. Right. So yeah, so basically he would just hire a you know a lead installer and two helpers for that guy or whatever to run the second crew. And then he would just need to increase the payroll on his policies to account for the second crew. Okay. Could you check how much his payroll right now is? Let me see. Do you work for him or with him or? Are you his brother or who are you to him? Oh, he's my uncle. We work together. Okay. You work with him? Are you a helper for him or? Oh no, we um. I take care of all his stuff because you know. Oh yeah. Oh, let's see here. All right. So here's the most recent. All right. So we started these policies last February. Let's see what we've got here. What's he running currently? You running three helpers, plus himself. Um. Yeah. Yeah, because we've got payroll on here of basically 120, 000 for the helpers plus on the workers' comp he's included so there's 59, 300 added for that because that's the amount that was set by the state last year for him to be included in North Carolina. So he has 120, 000 in payroll for his helpers currently. Is he looking to hire like a one lead guy two helper crew? To work under him. So he's got like 180. Yeah, on the workers' comp he's got 179, 300. Okay. On the the package policy the general liability is 145 because it's 120 plus it's only 25, 000 for the owner on the GL versus 59, 300 on the workers' comp. So basically, we would need if he wants to add a second crew to work under his company, then he needs to just add the amount of payroll that he's going to have. For this second crew to his policies, does that make sense? Yeah. So like if he's going to pay the the lead guy more, I imagine like usual then maybe they make 60 or 70 or something and helpers make. 40 or 50 or something like that is usually what it comes out to. Yeah. He would just need to add up how much payroll he's going to have for the three or four ran crew that he's going to hire, and then add that to his policies. Okay. Yeah, because I think um he might need to change that because I think he went over that this year. This year, okay. Yeah. If you increase it in general before we add the next crew, then you know we can obviously do that as well. Yeah. But we're making the payroll change. Is he running three three helpers plus himself? Is that what he's doing currently? Yeah, right now. Okay, and he went over 120, 000 in payroll for those three guys. Um. I'm not 100% sure. Oh. But I believe so. Um. Could you check how much we have for payroll for uh for install solutions. Install solutions. Yeah. So so right now what he's going to do is uh I guess the three helpers that he has he's going to give them the the truck. And he's going to find new helpers. I think that's what he had mentioned. Oh, because he like trust those guys or whatever that work with him. Yeah. To kind of run their own stuff and then just bring on some new guys to work with him. Right. Yeah, that's a smart way to go about it to be honest. Yeah. See. Give me a second here. I'll have to go Okay. But you said you see the window's this renewed yours is in February too so both of your policies are February I believe yeah his is February so he runs HTR by himself yeah and then you run Install Solutions LLC with him right I see okay but neither of you install for the Install Solutions company you just pay a crew to to run under that company name right I see okay yeah it definitely sounds like we need to increase the payroll at the renewal on both policies obviously if you're going to have a lot more payroll it's better just to kind of pay it throughout the year then have to get hit with a five thousand dollar audit bill or something crazy which it sounds like if you're going to be you said close to two twenty five on Install Solutions yeah yeah I mean you may get hit with like a five thousand dollar audit bill to be honest because you only have one hundred and twenty on there right now yeah and it's seventy three eleven so yeah you have a hundred thousand dollars worth of extra payroll then it's it's going to be five thousand something at your audit just in that worst case I'd say yeah I mean if you're at two twenty five that's one hundred and five thousand an extra payroll if you do yeah I mean it'll be fifty five hundred is somewhere around fifty five hundred fifty seven hundred something like that I'd say probably if you had one hundred and five thousand an extra payroll okay so just obviously be prepared for that whenever you complete your audit yeah but yeah we definitely need if you're going to have that are you planning on things being pretty much the same next year too yeah okay yeah I mean we definitely you're just running one crew under that company though yeah man they did a lot of work then that's a lot of payroll yeah is it three guys or four guys oh it's four guys oh okay that's a big crew too are they doing a lot of big buildings ever what are they doing yeah they are they're they're they're a good crew and they're starting to get good work to what's up on the the bigger stuff you know so they're staying busy it sounds like if they're doing that much payroll yeah then I think only half of them have like family so they're all they don't care to be out yeah yeah but yeah I mean it sounds like we definitely need to bump that payroll up I mean if you want to go to to two twenty five at the renewal I mean we can we can increase it now and they'll start taking some extra premium from now until the renewal but you're only going to have a couple well you're only going to probably have one at two payments because you had a payment that was probably just taken today didn't you because it renews on the eighteenth of February and it's the eighteenth of December today so yeah a payment was just made today on it um so the next one is the eighteenth so basically you only have one payment left which is January eighteenth and then the policies renew February eighteenth so it's not going to do a whole lot to increase the payroll right now to be honest yeah I mean you you already kind of know what to expect I guess you've already gone over all the numbers you and Hugo so yeah yeah and I guess y'all brought in a pretty good amount of money with doing that much work well that's that's what we would like to think of it it's never enough though is it no we are I want to be honest we right now we're about around forty five profit but from there talking now to you about the insurance and taxes yeah I know well building discounts are all the companies still doing these big discounts I know yeah but I know they down it back a little bit maybe but they're still a little you know that just hurts the installers when they discount all these buildings the way they do yeah it really does because the installers don't get paid the same that they would if they didn't discount them which they should but yeah they it doesn't change your job right it doesn't change the installer's job just because they the building I mean y'all get paid less because they discounted at thirty percent or forty percent or whatever it is yeah I know that's been a a sore subject for a lot of installers in the last year or so since these discounts have really been getting a little crazy yeah there's just too many there's so many manufacturers and so many dealers these days it's just like yeah right right now things like everybody's having a problem finding installers so hopefully they change their prices because they ain't as many installers I think well they're getting tired of dealing with it yeah you know I mean I've had several that have quit and gone to do something else because oh really they just don't make as much money you know with these discounted buildings and stuff and just you know just the headache of doing the job and getting paid less and some for some people it it's too big of a difference you know yeah they're probably like the ones that have been doing it a long time what's that yeah I said
