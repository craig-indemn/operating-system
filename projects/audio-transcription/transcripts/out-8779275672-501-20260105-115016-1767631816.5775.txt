I'm an agent here with Alliance Insurance. I'm trying to get a debt page pulled out of the portal. That the insured has requested it. I cannot get this thing to to pull up. I was wondering if you could tell me if this is available through the portal. Its policy number is five one. P as in Paul, four four eight five Q as in Queen. The name insured is Marisol Isadora Morales. Okay, hold on. I have messed up this thing for the last twenty minutes and it's it won't find her information. Yeah, you're not able to get a copy of this on the policy because it's in the old platform. You'd have to email it in. Do you need that email address? Oh boy, I have that address. That thing takes forever to get correspondence back. Is there any way to rush this? What address do you have? It's um let me see here it is I think it's NSA PO processing at NSA Group dot com. Okay, that's not the correct one. So let me give you the correct one for this. Certainly. It is ICS so igloo cat Sam. Support at NSA Group dot com. ISC I'm sorry ICS support at NSA Group dot com okay. Cool. Any idea what the turnaround time for this could be? Um normally they're they're relatively fast I would say. If not by the end of the day tomorrow. Oh man, well that's that's fantastic. They I had a client. I'm not going to bore you with a long story. I waited three weeks for something else to get processed the other day. The other week, so the client was mad. But okay, thank you very much. I'm going to check it out and look for a reply. Hope you have a good day. Thanks you too bye.
