This is Rick. Hi Rick, this is Kelsey calling from Auto Owners. I was just calling to let you know that we have updated your portal access and how you are, added as a security admin. Hey, okay. I appreciate you letting me know. It helps me to manage our team a little better. So thank you very much for the heads up. Yes, no, you're very welcome. And then did you need me to like help go through anything? Yeah, if you don't mind, let me just check one thing. We're mainly what what tends to lead me to these conversations and is trying to add a new team member. So let me just log in and see if Kendall's been. Um, sort of given access. I think she's been through the appointment process, but let me just find. Her user, let's see here. No, she looks good. I mean, when I see her name and it doesn't it no longer says no portal access by her name, that tells me that she's you know been appointed and has portal access. So that was the that was the the what that was the catalyst I guess for all this. So it looks like we're good. Everybody else looks. I'll double check, but everybody looks active and that's fine. But Kendall Worley was the new teammate. Looks like she's ready to go. Yes, yep, yep, and I show her on there as well too. Perfect. All right, I appreciate the call. Yes, you're very welcome. Have a great day. You too. Thanks. Thanks. Bye bye.
