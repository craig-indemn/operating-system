It's a great data lines insurance. This is Jamie. Hey Jamie, sorry about that. It's all good. My kids people doing with all day, so no worries. Okay, what I was saying is that I went back into the exact same transaction that I started this morning. The new Kia and I just deleted off both your old keys. Okay. Okay. No transaction, Jessica. I'm sorry, I don't remember what it was. I think it was like 1700 dollars and some change. Back to 662 dollars and 53 cents. Okay. Okay. I push all this through for you effective today, and so therefore it's going to take the billing system a full three days to update, just like before, and then it will break out the new monthly payment. Hopefully by like Wednesday or Thursday of this week. Okay. Okay. Do you have access? Do you use the online portal at all? No, I don't think I ever have. I think I just use whatever you sent me. Okay, well, so I was going to say I can send you. If you want to call back in a few days, you can do that. If you need to have the system push you an invite so that you can log in and just use it yourself. I can set that trigger for you. No, that'll be good. Yeah, send me the invite for that. Okay, I will do that. Outside of that, anything else you need today? No, that'll be it. All right, dear. Well, again, I hope you enjoy the new ride and stay dry. It's currently monitoring here. Where I'm at, so yeah, have yourself a good week and we'll talk soon. Okay, great. Yep, thank you, Jamie. Bye, Jessica.
