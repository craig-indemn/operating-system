It's a great morning, Lawrence Insurance. This is Jamie. Hey, I need to cancel insurance on one of my vehicles. I can certainly help you do that. My phone system has pulled me into Jacob Todd, 580 Silver in Westerville, Carroll. Yep. Good morning, Jacob. Let me get this in. It's been here for you. Um, and it's called Lawrence Insurance Loading. Just a quick question: the vehicle in question that we're going to remove here. Uh, how do you return the tag back to the BNV or do you still have it in your possession? I am in the parking lot about to put the tag in right now. That works for me. Uh, all right, let's see what we got here. Um. Oh gosh, it's the 15th of September this year. Has been smoking by. All right. Um, it's going to be the Civic. I do have a 2020 Honda Civic on here. That's the one we're getting. Okay. Yep. Um, and then just confirming: there's still a 78 Chevy K10, a 23 Honda CRV, and a 2003 Chevy Impala on here. Yep. For all that, still good info. Okay. I'm deleting the 2020 Honda Civic right now. Is there anything else I can help you with this morning? No, but can you like a guess on how much my how much my premium is going to be now? I can certainly try to do that for you. Let's see if you'll tell me here. Okay, so system is now showing me the old premium was through. I'm sorry, parking lot. Excuse me, Jake. Old old old money was 3, 711 dollars. Um. New full term premium is showing 2, 462 dollars. It's showing me it's going to return back 550 dollars and 90 cents to you. Okay. Let's see if I can tell me any other info. I think that is all it's going to give me right now. Yeah, that's fine. I just need the I just need the ballpark for my wife. She wanted to know. Yeah, yeah. She handles all the money. Mine too. Yeah. Well, is there anything else I can help you with this morning? Nope, I'll be up. All right, make sure that tag goes back, brother. Otherwise, the BNV will give you headache. Outside that, you have a great day and great week. We'll talk soon. Thank you. Oh, bye. Bye.
