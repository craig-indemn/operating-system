Thank you for holding. This is Heather. How can I help you? Hey Heather, it's Belinda at HPB Insurance, um in High Point, North Carolina, and we're doing an AOR on a progressive boat policy for Freddie and Gloria Willis. And it asked for the prior agency name. She sent me the deck page, but would I put Pilot Mountain Insurance or Alliance? It's Alliance. We haven't been Pilot Mountain in a while. Oh oh okay, all right Alliance. And then it asked for the prior agency code. Yeah, you don't need it when you send it over. It will automatically they'll usually honor that. So are you AORing all of their stuff or? Um. Just yeah, well I've already wrote the auto um effective one twenty three and see the boat not till April. So that's why we're doing the AOR on the boat because it's uh you guys wrote it right it wasn't direct. Right. So we're yeah she sent me the deck page on that and the umbrella but we're not going to write the umbrella it didn't renew what for a while she sent me that too until after we get the boat transferred that way we'll have all the assets at one place and then we can write the umbrella when it renews. Yeah I would just have them reach out to us because they haven't canceled or or said anything. No. Uh huh. That yeah I told her I just told her this morning hers just downloaded this morning on the auto um and I told her be sure and call because if she's I don't know how she set up on her pay plan but we have a lot of people that they automatically draft. Because they think that we call and of course we can't call and cancel somebody's policy but they don't know that. Yeah. So anyway yeah she'll be calling but I didn't know our like our agency codes nine eight two six three that it says prior and I'm like well how would I know that. Yeah and you don't have to put it on there usually they'll honor it as long as they have signature so you don't have to. Yeah. Okay cool all right well then I'll put Alliance and that'll be less confusing too I didn't know which one to put. Yeah. But it was acquired by Alliance probably like three or four years ago so yeah. Oh okay so the website still says Pilot Mountain I guess they haven't updated that. Um we we just have five locations so our actual um website is Alliance. Gotcha. Yeah. Okay well that sounds good well that answers my questions I'll get a signature on this and that way they'll get it in pretty in time before April. Okay that sounds good thank you. I'll have her give you guys a call thank you. Bye bye.
