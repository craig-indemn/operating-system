Hey Karen, this is Brandy with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Hi Brandy, I'm good. I hope you are doing well. I'm doing good. Good. I had a question because I had issued a few policies, like or package policy last week, and whenever I issued them at the end, and I was going to download applications and send it to him to sign in our system. There was like some kind of error or something. I know the policies went through because I have access to them now. Okay. But I was just wondering if I how can I get the applications to send him to sign. Okay. So are you logged into our system now? Yes, Pin Connect. Okay. So what you'll do is go into Penn Plus, like you're going to be doing a quote. Well, or you can access the policy however you want to. Just go into that policy through Pin Connect. Okay. So I'm on the auto policy. Okay, or is it in like the quote that you submitted? Oh no, it's like the actual policy. Okay, all right. No, let's. Yeah, let's go back to the original quote. I'm sorry. Sorry, I was off. I was going to take the whole day off and I just got logged in. I'm like I'm trying to get my brain going. Okay. No, you're good. Thank you. Oh. Okay. So yeah, pull up that new business quote that you submitted. Okay. It'll be grayed out and everything, but still it's fine. Okay. Okay, and do I do I go all the way to the end where it says app? No, go over to the reports. There's a report tab. Okay. Do you see manage e signature? Yes. Or a little okay, click on that. And that's where it should allow you to send. Put in the email and everything to send it for signatures. Okay. Now will that be the same way because we did an umbrella policy as well. Yes. Okay, and I don't. Well. And the umbrella may not have processed. Let me look because that that's manual. Yeah, I didn't see it yet, and I think it still says. It says issued, but I don't think it. What's the policy number? Um. Okay. The policy number on the umbrella is three eight zero. Zero three three nine eight eight five. Yeah, it did issue. Yeah, you're good. But you can still do it the same way. I just thought it might if it hasn't been processed. I thought it might create a little bit of an issue, but so you're good on that one. Do it the same way. Okay, and. Okay, so I just did it for all of them now. Um, will we get a copy of those? I don't remember. It's been a while since I actually issued a Penn policy. Um. So the auto and the home downloads into the system, but the umbrella does not. So you'll have to go to the deck page and and you'll have to manually input that info. Okay, okay, all right. Yeah. All right, sounds good. That's all I needed. Okay. Thanks for calling. Have a good afternoon. Yeah, you do. Thanks. Thank you. Bye.
