This is Jana. Can help you. Hey there, it's Gina Foreman. Hey, how are you doing, Gina Foreman? I'm good. It's like. First, oh, I'm sorry, missed you yesterday. I did try a couple times, but I wasn't able to connect. Okay, let me get your account pulled up here. Give me just one second. Yeah, let's get a couple questions before we talk about the renewal quote. Did you get that vehicle's registered in Virginia? No, I. We have to do things online. I have to apply for the getting the title thing done and also driver's license. I'm in the midst of doing that. But what I need is I have to show proof that this house is insured. I I tried to pull up my last document, but it has the post office box in Montairian. I have not had that for more than three years. I don't know. I know you're. I don't know if you made changes yet or if it's even possible to get a declaration page with the address of the house on it yet. Let me look here. I'm sure if it's doable or not. Okay, I'm looking here. So bear with me. Uh huh. Okay, get the end auto owners here. Because I know I did go in and try update the address. So let me check that out right quick. Okay, yeah, they have got that updated. I can get your copy of that. That ain't no problem. But shows address on here 80 Little Dan River Road, Lodgeville, Virginia. Right now, I know I do everything by what we call it online. Is there any way you can email me that? Yeah, I can I can email you a copy of that. Not a problem, Jana. Now another question. How is your travel trailer? What's aggressive? Say that again. Your travel trailer you have what's aggressive. Oh. But um. That is kind of crazy. I was wondering where do you have it garage. Is it going to be garage in Virginia as well? I don't think so. We actually are in the process. My brother-in-law is buying it. Okay. I had it. I had it insured at Raleigh Avenue. No. Right, I've seen that. Everything is faded registration and everything. The only thing is I didn't change the address. The the vehicle it is in Matthews. I I may have to change it to his address. I don't know if that's going to make a big change with the policy. Or I mean it's already been renewed. He he actually even though it's in my name. He made the payment already. He paid the insurance for the year which I always paid it yearly. If there needs to be an adjustment made, I don't I don't know if it's different because Surge County is different than Matthews. North Carolina. So I mean I don't know what county he's in, but Matthews is the city. So I'm not sure what to do because he doesn't actually own it yet. He's still playing money on it. So I just didn't want to. I got we didn't want to transfer it to this address and have to get a new plate. And it's kind of in the mix. Let's go ahead. Well, one one night you said this is your brother-in-law. Yeah. Okay. What you could do is if you wanted to do this, you got two options. You can have it transferred over into his name. Uh huh. And put yourself down or or you and your husband down as a lien on that travel trailer. Until he gets it paid for with y'all. That way he can't do anything with it until y'all sign off on it. Well, I mean he can he he. Okay, which means I mean we were all right. The other option is I will need his address where it is being garage where we can get that updated to the correct garage and address. All right, I can do. I can most likely do that and just put it in my name because he hasn't decided what he's going to do yet. I did not want to register it in Virginia and have to pay. Get the new tag and everything. I mean if I have to I have to then I guess that's just another thing I got to figure out how to go about doing that. Yeah, it's wanting to get that mailing address changed and wanting to get the garage and location changed on that travel trailer. All right, let me ask. If I change the address only, is that kind of is going to be a change in the coverage? Money. Well, I'm sure it it depends. It depends on the county. Now it can either go up or down. I mean I don't know. I wouldn't know that until I have it processed. But y'all also
