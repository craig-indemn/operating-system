Hello. Hey John, it's Brian at Alliance Insurance Services. How are you? Brian, thanks very much for calling. Yeah. I will know that Amani is no longer with your organization. That is the unfortunate truth. Okay, well, maybe you can can help. Okay, I'm with the Woodbridge Condominium Association. We have insurance through your through Alliance. Yeah. And I can give you the policy number if you need it. But okay, a couple of things. And I spoke to Amani about this some time ago when he was with you. We have a homeowner that is. He I'll try to be brief and give you the whole picture on what happened. Okay. He had some vandalism in his unit. And he wanted to file a claim. He wanted us to file a claim for him with our insurance company. Okay. And so we we looked into the matter and we found out that number one, it was his tenant that caused the damages. He did a police he had a police report. He showed us the the pictures and the police report. We looked at it and it said, well, this is not damages. We don't see any damages in this police report that he submitted to us. At the pace of less sloppy. Of any tenant that no hastily moves out. Yeah. So we we said no, we're not going to file a police report because number one, there are no damages. Number two, it was his tenant that did this. Yep. So you know as an association, we felt that no owner should file a claim to want a claim. For damages which his tenant did. Yep. Agree. So so we said no. Okay. Um. Get more to the into the story. He filed a a suit. For us, each one of us to appear in small claims court this coming Thursday. About this matter, he says we have to carry out our fiduciary responsibility to process a claim. And I spoke to our lawyer. He says one of the things that we should do number one contact our insurance company. Find out since he's filing a claim against us personally. Find out does the does our insurance policy have the DNO which is directors and officers insurance coverage. That's I I tried to go to that look like five hundred pages of documents on the policy that I I just started that I just didn't come across it yet. They said that's our insurance not insurance our lawyer said check with their insurance company find out if the if we have directors and officers insurance coverage. It says number two. Does that insurance policy cover the management company that was doing work for? The condominium association. Does that insurance policy cover not only the board of directors and officers of the of the association but does it cover the the management company? And. And oh, and he says with regard to that claim that this gentleman this owner had he says. Yep. Have that file with your insurance company. Okay. So three things. Yep. Number one. Does the policy cover the board of directors and the officers? It does. Yes, you have two million dollars of directors and officers liability coverage, and that has a retroactive date of. March twenty seven two thousand twenty three. Okay. Very good. This this all happened I think last year or I think last year. Okay. And does it cover the management company? That was doing work for the association. So you you have several. See how how do I best explain this? So from an what what would in order for that to be the case, John the property management company would need to be listed as what we call an additional insured under your contract. It's not specifically listed. However, you do have several instances where it. This is for lack of a I don't want to get too into the details and make it real insolvency here, but you have what's called an automatic additional insured status when it's required by a written contract agreement or permit. So if the property management company within their contract states that they have to be listed as an additional insured, you automatically get it without actually having to list them. Under the policy, however, those are specific to certain types of vendors, so to speak, so a co-owner of an insured premises. A concessionaire trading under your name, a controlling interest, a granter franchise, anybody that's in a lease agreement with you, managers or lessees of premises, mortgages. Owners or other interests from whom land has been leased, state or government agencies, and then vendors just specifically list vendors. So now you're getting into somewhat of a. Of a gray area where is the property management group considered a vendor, and you know that that ultimately would be left to the. Contract language and and a claims adjuster to determine if yes or no to that. So that is I don't want to say yes or no to that. I would I would let somebody else handle that aspect of it. But there are several instances where you have automatic
