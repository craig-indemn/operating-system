Sorry for your hold. This is Cody. May help you. Cody, this is Paul from Cold Facts Furniture. How are you? Hey Paul, I'm great. How are you, sir? I'm good. I need your help. I probably should have just tried with you to start with. We're trying to get a certificate of insurance to rent a truck. And I, I'm just kind of bogged down in the customer support. Can I forward what I have to you to see if you can move it along? Yes, sir. Yeah, please send that to me and then I will see if I can help speed that. So you're trying to rent a truck, you said. Right. I think it's our tractor. I'm assuming it's our tractor. Apparently, it's out of service. And so now we're kind of desperately in need of a replacement while it's being serviced. So. But anyway, for a tractor trailer is what you're saying. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's for a tractor. So you're just trying to lease the actual like a dry storage trailer for it. I'm assuming. No, let me forward to you the rental contract. Okay. And and you know the communications that I've had so far. Yes, sir. With customer support, and I think everything you need's going to be right in there. Okay. That will be great. I'll take a look at that and see if I can help speed that process up for you. If you have any questions or anything, I'll give you a call or reach you email back and let you know. All right, I appreciate it. Yes, sir. No problem, Paul. Right. Yeah, and if you can just have the certificate emailed to me, then I can get it to where it's going. Okay, I will do it. All right, thank you. Yes, sir. Have a great day. All right, how are you too? Bye bye.
