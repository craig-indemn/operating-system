Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Rachel called me yesterday sometime, and I didn't get her message till after office because she's not in today, is she? Yeah, she's only in Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from nine to three thirty. Oh, well, I don't know what she wanted to. I guess I'll just have to wait and call tomorrow. Okay. All right. Thanks. Sounds good. Bye. Bye.
