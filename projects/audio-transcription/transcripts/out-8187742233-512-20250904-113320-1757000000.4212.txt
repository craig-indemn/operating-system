Hello, I can calling. Hey, is this Mario? Yes, sir. Hey, sir, this is Joe at Alliance Insurance. How are you? Oh, perfect. How do you know everything about you? Yeah, yeah, well, I'm glad I called. Hey, working on your stuff now, going over this tax card, and if you'll permission Mario, I'd like to ride out there, look around, take a couple pictures for our underwriter. And once I do that, I need to give you a call back. I have a few questions about the property, that I'll just need some information from you if you don't mind maybe a little bit later this afternoon. Yeah, that's fine, and you need to go inside because there's a lot of a lot of fixing that has to be done. No, I'm just going to look around the tax card. It kind of shows those three buildings in a row, and then the canopy, but there's another rectangular building sitting closer to the road. It looks like that the tax the tax card's not picking up, but the Google Map aerial view is picking up. Okay, you talking about the the blue building? I mean the green building. Yeah, the green building. Yes, sir. Yeah, that's that's what I need to know too. I don't know nothing about that stuff. That's why I need all that information. Looked at. Yes, I'm going to go by there. Okay, if you're okay, I'll be by there in about 20 minutes. I'm going to take a few pictures, walk around. I'll be on an off white four door Buick, and I'm just taking a few pictures and then I said I'm working with the underwriters now. We have we have a few more questions. I'll give you a call and go through questions with you and get them turned into our underwriting too. And that's and that's for for getting a quote on the on that location. Yes, sir. For the building itself, for the property, for your investment, the structure and then also liability, which is a common coverage. You want property and liability, no matter if you're moving into it tomorrow or six months from now, you're taking the operations into it. Okay. We need to cover the building and the liability. Okay, perfect. Thank you. I'm working. I'm working and talking to you. So the the question is this: that we go take pictures of the property, make sure everything is good, and then I get three type of insurance on it: liability and stuff. Thank you guys. Liability helps you as a property owner. Hold on, hold on, sure. Got it. Okay. Uh huh. Give me one second, Joe. All right, I apologize, but I'm the only AAA company that wants to work here. So. And um, since I've been here, the only thing I've been doing is working. No, I get no problem. Okay, here we go. Now I can talk to you. The customer is on the way. Yeah, so. Yes, sir. Just just in a nutshell, and you probably know this as a business owner. You obviously want liability on on your property on your business to help protect your business name, and then you want you want property coverage just like you know. Home insurance. You want to protect your house. You want to protect your property that you own. So that's that's what this policy will be: property, which is the structure itself, and then liability if someone makes a claim against you or the or the business there for bodily injury or property damage they they get hurt. Okay. And that's common. That's standard. I'm sure that's what you would likely have on any of your businesses or any of your properties. Property. Well, I'm new here to everything. I don't know what the rules are here. You tell me California. I know your my rules over there. I just don't know a lot about the rules out here. Yes, and I talked to Sabu by the way. Great great. Oh, he did. He and I had a great conversation last week and shared a couple emails. Yeah, so we're working together to help you. Yeah, we'll help you anyway we can. I'll get out there and take a few pictures and look around. I'll call you this afternoon with a follow up and we'll put this thing together and get it ready for you prior to your purchase date. Awesome. Thank you. Yes, sir. We'll talk soon. Yes, sir. Okay. Uh huh. Okay.
