Or your help, is it Cody? I help you. Hey Cody, it's Jennifer again. Hey. Okay, so Mario said he does want to start the policy. Okay. Um. Give me just a second here. I was saving something real quick. Okay. Let me get over here. Just gotta finish this up real quick in just a second. Okay. Installation. All right, so we've got a workers comp policy. Eighty thousand in payroll for helpers, one hundred forty two thousand four hundred for him to be included, correct. Yes. And workers comp, or excuse me, package policy. Okay, we're good there on that. Got all that. So that one was forty eight ninety five. Is he going to want these set up on? I pretty much require these days that they get set up on a monthly auto draft out of a checking account. Do you have his checking account information? No, but I can send it to you by email. That's fine. I can go ahead and get the policies. It is four thirty. Um. Maybe first thing in the morning. When did he want to load? He want to load tomorrow morning or. Yeah, he wants to load tomorrow morning. Okay. Um. But he didn't answer me. So just now. And he's going to be working for Tol. I am assuming. No, he's working for a steel building. Okay, he's working at SBS. Okay. I am cutting it close. I gotta pick up my kids here in just a little bit. Um. How early are we talking about? He's wanting to load. I am not sure. You told me that he was going to load tomorrow. I can get these issued and send a certificate over to Brenda at SBS first thing in the morning. Okay. I should have it done by eight thirty or so in the morning. Okay, and then you'll send the paperwork by email. Then right. I'll send the paperwork. Do you want me to just send the e signatures for the proposals over to your email address to get his signature? Is that easiest. Just e sign them to you to get his signature. Yeah, sorry. No, you are fine. Okay. Yeah, um. Yeah, if you could just send it and I'll send it to him. Yeah, as soon as I get in the office in the morning. Um. He's looked at the proposals. He understands he's what he's going to be paying a month and all that sort of stuff. Yeah, I told him six zero eight and four zero seven a month. So it's what a thousand and fifteen bucks a month basically or so. Yeah, I sent them all the paperwork. You. Um. You sent me. All right. I will get them issued first thing in the morning and send Brenda a certificate. And I will see see you on that as well. Just so you know that that was done. And he will be loaded good to load as soon as she gets that. Okay. All right. Thank you. Just email me his routing and account number as soon as you can. I'll have to wait a day or two for them to set up the billing account. Yeah. But once once they do that, I will go in and make the first payments. And then I'll combine the billing accounts into one. So he just has one draft for both policies each month. Okay. All right. All right. Thank you. Uh huh. All right. Bye. Bye.
