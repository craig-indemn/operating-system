Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How may I help you? Yes, I called her today and also called Friday. Left a message for you all to call me. I can't get anybody to call me from down there, and I've been sitting here waiting all day. And every time you put me on hold, it comes on a recorder and it says, "Leave a message and we'll give you a call back." And nobody's called me back yet. Okay, what is it regarding? I need to cancel my car or truck insurance on my one of my policies. Okay, and that's a personal car, correct. How's every car? That's a personal car. Yeah, that's a personal. Yeah. Okay, all righty. Give me one second. I'll transfer you over. I'll take it part. I'm having a hard time hearing you. I'm sorry you were going to say something. I had a hard time hearing you. I couldn't hear you. Oh, I said I was going to go ahead and transfer you over. Well, what's going to happen is it's going to put me on a recording again. If you'd like, I can also give you our support. If you'd like, I can also give you our support email where you can send that request over and somebody will contact you that way. Okay. Thank you. Mhm. Would you like to email? I want. Let me try a little more time. Maybe somebody might accidentally pick up. Okay, one second. I'll transfer you over.
