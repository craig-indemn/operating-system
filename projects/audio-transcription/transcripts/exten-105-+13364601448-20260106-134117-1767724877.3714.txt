Hey Daniel, oh sorry, how are you? I'm great, Rick. How you been? Happy New Year. Happy New Year, man. Happy New Year. Been very good. Had a good end of the year. Had a great year last year. Got moved into our new location, which you should come by and check out when you get a chance. And that was yeah that was a big big project Christopher had going on late last year. So so yeah, we're trying to get settled in and get get cranked up for 2026 here. Right on, right on. Well, I want it two things. I want to get back to you on that email. Yeah, sure. I think the best option is for you to call our contracting department. Okay. And seeing about how to merge all those codes. Okay. That's the only way it's going to show up on one statement. Okay, okay. I sort of had that suspicion, I just wasn't sure you know so that's fine. Do you have their phone number? No, if you got it handy, go ahead. All right, hang on one second. Yep. All right, let's see. It's 888. Okay. Okay. Two zero three. Yep. Three eight, two three. Okay, wonderful. I'll reach out to them. See what the see what we might do there. Yep. Yep, and you're going to look for the contracting option, not licensing contracting. Got it. Okay, I'll jot that down with an asterisk and and refresh my memory, man. But we seem like we had some jumping through some hoops last year with like different different agency codes like for okay we've got a small business code but oh wait a minute here now you've got a management liability or you know there was like certain types of policies had to have a different code so it may be that we at the you know the best we might be able to do is get down to maybe two codes if that's how that works does that sound right to you? It sort of so you will always still have the master code and then you're going to have what's called a policy holder service code so if you want us to service a policy on your behalf you have you have to have those two codes then there may be a management liability code um and you can consolidate that into one so when you talk to contracting you're going to have to review that with them based on all the entities that you own I got you okay okay easy enough and if something needs to be done in an email you know see see me on it but I think it's the best way to to go about it no I get it it just you know that's where we need to start the conversation and if it if it somehow you know gets sideways we'll reach out and get some help from you but it's that's where I need to start so that's kind of what I needed to know and you know hopefully they can start steering me in the right direction I know that's probably you know take a little bit of legwork on there end but hopefully we can figure out the most you know efficient way to do it I think that's what we're we changed our management systems earlier last year and so some of these accounting functions have I think we're suddenly realizing that all these multiple agency codes that we used to like having for some reason that I don't quite understand now we don't like having you know so just trying to trying to clean it up a little bit you know absolutely and then the second thing I was going to tell you I'm going to be starting a position with the Hartford School of Insurance as an instructor trainer awesome dude starting next Friday so you still have me until next Thursday but it is a a dream of mine and it's something I've been wanting to pursue now for a few years and the opportunity comes man I jumped all over it I don't blame me at all man I've often had in my mind after you know a 30 plus year you know career on the agency side that you know instructing or something would be an interesting change I just hadn't you know just hadn't gone down the path but you're you're staying with Hartford being part of that whole school of insurance thing which I know is a very good one I yeah I couldn't think of a better gotta to move on to that and I tell you what um you know we we we have a stated incentive in 2026 to start having more intentional conversations around our team's education and so you know it sounds like and this is just me not being as familiar with every carrier's offerings in this in this arena tell me where I can go and find information on that I'm assuming it's just a portal and just look for educational opportunities or something like that but is there a specific spot you can steer me to yeah so two things keep in mind with you all being part of ISU there may be some additional what we call VIP
