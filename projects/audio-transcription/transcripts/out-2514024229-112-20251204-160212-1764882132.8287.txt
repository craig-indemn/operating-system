Hello. Hey, Mackenzie. This is Brandi with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm doing well. How are you? Good. I'm helping Joe out on getting your renters' insurance together. So I can send you over proof of insurance. I just wanted to make sure before I did that everything was okay with you. So. Just so that you know what a renters' policy is and what it covers. So. The personal property you'll have coverage for that. Joe, how do you do fifty thousand? This is to cover your personal property. That you own or that you and your fiance owns in the place. You can go up from that, however much you want, and you can change it at any point in time. Then you would have below that it is additional living expense. Something happens to the place, and you cannot stay there anymore because maybe there was like a small fire or water leak or something. And you're not able to stay there anymore. Then you have ten thousand to stay somewhere else while that that repairs or those repairs are being made. Okay. And then. He told us that. The landlord is needing you to have a hundred thousand in coverage for liability. Yes. We do a minimum of five hundred thousand, and the reason reason for that is because the liability is minimum a hundred thousand. But it is to protect you if you are held liable for damages in the place. You want to have more than a hundred thousand to make sure that you don't you're not paying anything out of pocket. Okay. So we do for Alliance. Our minimum is five hundred thousand. It's just to protect you. It's literally dollars. In comparison to one hundred thousand or five hundred thousand. Okay. And then. We do have medical payments on here. So if someone comes on or comes into the place or if you have guests, they get hurt. We say you know if you're held liable for their injuries or whatever. Then you know you can give them five thousand dollars to the medical payments. That's something that is on every policy. The lowest that you can go is one thousand. I always do five thousand on the renters' policy to give you that extra and. The minimum is like two dollars. If you change. Okay. Okay. And then if you ever had to file a claim or whatever the case may be, whether it is to file liability claim. Or a personal property claim because something happened in the place. And your suffer is damaged or stolen. You would pay five hundred dollars. That would be the deductible, and then you would get your personal property replaced. Okay. For all of that coverage and this is for a year long. So whatever day we get this started, whether it's today or tomorrow. If you paid in full for a year, it's two hundred and twenty-seven dollars. If you want to pay monthly, it would have to be on auto pay. And it would be twenty-two dollars and seventy-five cents, and that does end up equaling out to two hundred and seventy-three dollars at the end of the year. So you do get a paid in full discount. Gotcha. Yeah, get me out. Gotcha. Um, I probably um am I going to get an email of this and just the the normal how I get the policy. I'm able to choose if I want to go monthly or, uh, pay in full by then. Yeah, so I wasn't sure if when you needed this policy to go into effect. Yeah, we'll just head and just do monthly then because I do uh have to already have um insurance. So we'll just head and do monthly then. That's perfectly fine, and then I mean you won't get the paid in full discount. But if somewhere down the road like three months from now you're like, oh, I just want to pay it all that way. I don't have to worry about it. Okay. That's not a problem. Okay, perfect. Then, but the just the paid in full discount wouldn't be in that. But yeah, so I can go ahead. Our winter's y'all's moving date. Our moving date is December tenth, but they have it where for them we had to have proof of renters' insurance after twenty four hours of lease generation of after we've signed that they had to have proof. Okay, no problem. So what I'll do is I'll go ahead and issue this. That way I can give you proof of insurance, and then there will be one email for you to sign an application. The second email will be. From auto owners to where you can create your own portal and set up your auto pay there. You can set up by email. By card or your routing and checking account, you can choose whatever day you want it to come out every month, and that way you can make your first initial payment whenever you have time. And then the third email will be the email from me. With your
