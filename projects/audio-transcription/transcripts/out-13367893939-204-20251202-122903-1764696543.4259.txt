We charge for men's haircut and beard trim. Twenty dollars. Cash or card. No, I don't take cards, honey. All right, I'll see in about 20 minutes. What's your name? Joe, did you say? I'm sorry, did you say 20 minutes? What did you say? I said 20 minutes. One o'clock. One o'clock. See you then. Thank you. Thank you.
