Hi Lois. Hey, it's me. Yeah, yeah, it tells me when it rings. You don't have rental. You never have. Um, I mean we can't add we can't add it right at the moment, but you know with when you had two cars you didn't you know you had another vehicle, but but you don't have rental on there. And to put rental on, it's twenty three dollars every six months for fifty. They pay up to fifty dollars a day, up to fifteen hundred dollars maximum. If somebody else is fault and you need a rental, then their liability would pay for you to have a rental car. But in an accident unless you got rental on it and you don't have it at this present time. So well, I just need to find out everything because the kids is asking. Like you've got rental, don't you? And I thought I did because of the price I've been paying for all this insurance. So well, you've got full coverage. It's the you know rental and all that stuff is extra. You know that you have to ask for. You know and like I say when you know Wayne was living, you had two vehicles on there. You you have an extra vehicle, you know and anybody with just one vehicle would probably need to add it. You know. I'll just can. Rachel, I'll just go rent, for myself and everything. I saw I can do stuff. Thank you for check. All right. Sorry, sorry about that. Say bye. All right. Thanks.
