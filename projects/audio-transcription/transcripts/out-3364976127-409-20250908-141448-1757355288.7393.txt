Hello, this is Derek. Hey, Derek, this is Corbin. What's Alliance Insurance? How you doing? Hey, good Corbin, how are you still? I'm good, I'm good. So hope your dad's okay, man. He's such a good dude. I really like him. He's doing good. I mean, we're anticipating him being you know back available and things like that on the first of October. He he's medical leave or kind of mental leave more more or less. So but he's doing great, man. He just needed some time away. I hear you, man. I hear you. Everybody, everybody takes their mental health for granted. You really got to you really got to take that time. So that's good. Your help. It's good to do. I'm doing my best, man. I'm I'm 22, so any help I get is the best. I'm getting trial by fire here. But he he's got a lot of stuff going on. I know that guy. Oh yeah, he does, and you know I've underestimated it in the whole time I've been you know involved in everything. So now I'm seeing it firsthand. I'm like, whoa, yeah, you got a lot going. That's cool. I just wanted to make sure. So what I what I'm doing is setting up making sure that we cover all of our bases here. So I know that um. Trying to, let's see, I'm trying to get into history. And just what you're doing that would be fair with you. My knowledge for what he wants is exactly kind of what he left on that voicemail for you. We didn't really talk about it too much else. So that's the only thing that I know as far as what we're knowing what he wants. So he told me you know hey you know Corbin will work it out. He'll send you an invoice for what we're needing and and go and get it paid because he doesn't want any type of lapses. But actually waiting on Truist to give me a card and that's what we're waiting on. So I might be able to drop a check by you guys or anything like that. Okay. Yeah, let me let me just bear with me here. I'm going to make sure we get taken care of here. And please forgive me if I sound a little bit pushy on the email. Don't mean to be pushy at all. No, you're not. You're not. You don't want any type of lapses or anything like that. And I'm like I kind of take that personally. It's like hey man if he if he goes without that's my fault. So yeah, I'm with you. I'm with you. I got you. I'm just making sure. Putting everything in. After a 12 months, the renewal's come up this month. I know it. I know it. Let's see. Okay. Again, I'm just putting stuff in a file here. Yeah, no worries. I'm sorry here about him and Sarah. Oh yeah, I mean to be honest with you, it it's kind of one of those it is but it is situations I guess so. And that's unfortunate on his part. Well, I'm kind of I'm with him because I'm kind of doing the same thing now, man. So whatever. It sucks. It's a death. I'm telling him, man, it's hard. That's why I totally get it. I totally get it, and it was mine was unexpected. It was valuable so. Yeah, that's you know I'm not going to be the one to you know give all details. That's that's his story to tell, but this was kind of unexpected too. Yeah, he needs to talk to somebody. I'm here, man. Because I. Is shocker. I'll tell him definitely. I mean I'll be able to talk to him a little bit sooner than you know everybody else will be, but you know I'm getting a deal to talk to him a little bit later here in September. So yeah, I hope a good thing to say about you. Yeah, I hope he's like like that place he bought up there. Man, that is so awesome. Like I hope he keeps it. I know he doesn't. That place old man. That that place is staying. I mean, he told me he was like, "Man, if I got to eat oodles of noodles for the whole you know rest of a couple years, I'll do it to keep that place." So he yeah, and he loves that place, and we all do. We're honest with you. Oh, really good. It seems like he could do a lot of stuff up there. Like he can camp, he can not camp. He's Point Boulevard. And you know zip. Two seven one zero three. Two seven one zero three. Yeah, right. It's it's literally like three miles from the house. So three nine four one West Point Boulevard. Let me write that down. Three nine four one West Point Boulevard. One zero seven two seven one zero three. Make that. The top area. Wait a minute. Let's see. Verify the vehicle location. Um. Verify vehicles. What should we do there? Verify vehicle location. Hmm. What's that zip code up there in Virginia? Oh, let me get the exact one for you. I don't know that off the top of my head, but in front of the computer. But I know he he's going to keep everything up there, so might as well change the. Yeah, that is it code. Yeah, that's going to be two four three four eight. Two four three four. See what it does here. Please make your phone nice. It looks good. All right, so that's done. Then we do the motorhome next. That is actually where I am going. Um. This policy will be canceled or non renewed due to vehicle being garage out of state. If need be, he did say that temporarily we can put everything in. Gwen the thirty nine forty one address. And I mean, if it's a matter of needing that vehicle here, I can go get that. Okay, let me see. Yeah, probably need to. For trying to see. And is that something that he can change later once he's available? Oh yeah, for sure. Well, perfect. Every state you got to write a policy for where that state is. We wear license in Virginia as well, so we would just at some point we need to rewrite it to a Virginia policy once he everything settles down. Yeah, well, I mean right now at this point we just want to make sure that he has some coverage. You know late September early October until he's making phone calls you know business phone calls. You know because he'll be available the twenty seventh of September. But I am going to be honest with you I don't think he'll be ready to pop into everything just yet. Yeah, I get it. Coverage is. Let me change it back. That was a good one to get a feet wet. See customer information. See update mailing address. Let's do it. Let's do it again. Requester Vance. Corbin. Change contact information. So we're going to do thirty nine forty one. West Point. West Point Boulevard. Two seven one zero three. Okay, got that. And then we're going to do that. And then we're going to do I feel like I am already living a forty year old life. Man, I work forty hours a week and I am tired by like eight o'clock. And I am like, okay, yep, I am already here. Gotcha. So here is another one. So we updated the motorhome. Travel trailer. So we change the address now too. Okay. Okay, perfect. Yeah. So let's update that address. Make sure. Checked it today. There we go. So it's with the Silverado and the motorhome or not the motorhome but the the fifth wheel. Yeah, yeah. Okay, perfect. Thirty nine forty one West Point. All right, that's good. Okay, no change in premium. Gotcha. Submit. Okay. All right, so we got those three updated. It's recreational stuff. Make sure there is nothing new this time. Motorhome. Motorhome, motorhome. Doing. He's paid in full. Motorcycle. Paid in full. Okay, those are good, and then. So this PT. Is that the travel trailer? I know that. Yeah. Okay, and then. What else we got? Auto, we're not touching. Home, we're not touching. Elamere, we're not touching. Umbrella. That's the one. We're not sure. Auto progressive. Progressive. Dulling fire. Oh my gosh. So this dwelling fire policy. See. For too long, I might have to give you guys a phone call. I am still driving around my beat up high school paid for Mustang. I want to get me a truck. I need a good insurance policy on it. Good luck. Those things are. Astronomical. Well, that's what I've learned. And. Don't have anything on my record, but I know still being a man that's twenty two years old is going to call against me. Yeah. I got you. So what? What's this property here? I am going through this thing because if there are questions we can ask him. Well, no, and I think this is the last thing. You might want to write down about the umbrella. Ask him. You know. And I think we're going to have to ask him about this one too. Let me quote this foremost policy. Foremost. So so an umbrella policy protects all your stuff that you own. Up to a certain level in case you are sued. So he's probably going to have to get his own there too. If I know him, he's going to want to get his own. So that's something I'll go ahead and start working on. Okay. I had to. So um. Send me a text. Let me log in to Foremost real quick. I can I can ask him about this one. Gotcha. And and. I won't be able to speak to him about anything like that until into September. So I mean, is that something else? I mean, it's not. It's not going to. Yeah, it's like even I mean it sounds stupid, but it's like even if I wanted to talk to him before I can. So it's more than things, man. It's they they've advised us, you know, hey. While he's you know focusing on himself right now, no outside influences. So. Good. Yeah, yeah, nothing. No, none of these are. Even he doesn't have to do this. I mean, but I know he wants to. Yeah, I think it's a peace of mind thing for him that he. Getting things organized. Yeah. So. So yeah, so ten forty nine Red Drive Independence Virginia. That's his. That's a. That's where he's at, right? Or. We we've always used nine zero seven Red. As as you know, that's the main house that he lives in. But but I know ten forty it has three address points on it, so I don't know which one he's used with you guys. But that one we need to change the mailing right. For sure. Currently, yeah, we'll change the mailing down here to. Thirty nine forty one. Everything mailing right now. He can update that. That one he definitely wants me to change the address right. Yeah, the mailing. Yes. Okay. Just for right now, we'll move all of his mailing for things related to him. To the thirty nine forty one West Point, and if he wants to change those in the future, I'll I'll let him handle that. Okay. I didn't know that that was. The only thing that we don't want, you know, we've already I've already reached out to the post office and got his mail starting to get forwarded here, but we don't want anything going to Hollinswood. Okay. All right. Let me change that. Except for the ones that she needs to handle payment on. All right. So I'll put. How I bank on here. All right, so that's good. And that needs to start ASAP, right? Yes. I mean, if you needed it a few days or something like that, that'd be perfect. I mean, he's not going to be driving it till the twenty seventh of September. No one's driving a vehicle actually. Two G C four Y L E Y two N one two two two. Probably not three. Okay, all right. Almost done. No worries. Separate it. Hospital of Education College. He is a trade school, so I mean I don't know if that's anything. I know certain ones will have trade or vocational school as an option. Okay. He went high school trade school in Marine Corps. Okay. If you want me to leave that vehicle on her policy, I am just joking. Just. It's been funny now. I am so sorry. Got to make light of it. Got to make light. One hundred percent. So we got to do two five hundred. At this point, you can't change them. So just yeah, I mean if you are a paying person, pray for him. Yeah. For sure. Five hundred. He doesn't have any towing or rental, so I am leaving that all. Same coverages. And if he sounded jumbled when he called you, that was because he had to make about forty different phone calls all within. About four hours. Oh no. Good gracious. That's not fun. No, no. That's like the the lady that had answered the phone whenever he had reached out. She was like, you know, hey, your phone's unavailable right now. Leave a message. He'll get back to you. And he's like, well, that's the thing he wants. And she's like, no, he's good about calling back. And he's like, no, no, no, no, he won't get back to me. I won't be available for a month. Yeah. Oh goodness. What is this thing? Okay. So order of sale. I am running the motor vehicle report. A lap update, slight ownership. Coverage. I don't know about this premium. It's running seventeen oh three. Oh, here. Um. See, because he's got multi-policy homeowner paid in full, paperless continuous gold. Five-year accident free, three-year safe driving, airbag discount. It might be the vehicle. It's what. That's probably a pretty expensive truck, isn't it? It's more than I can afford. I'll say that. Yeah, that's what it is. Point of sale. Yeah, I don't want to do a six-month policy. Yeah, so we did the progressive one at seventeen oh three. Um. But if you want, I can let me price it with one more carrier. That way we know. That way we know that that's a decent rate. I am going to quote you with another good carrier that I use all the time. That gives me good. Kind of get a comparison that way. Yeah. I think it's the single. I think it's the single Inside. I'll make this effective today. Gotcha. So you should be getting some emails from Progressive. Okay, I do see one. You have new Progressive policy documents, Progressive policy change confirmation. Things like that. Okay. Well, that's from the address changes. This one should just. Should be coming through. Might take a little bit, but that'll be a whole new set of. Email there. To. It just. Should be easy to know what to do in other words because Progressive's pretty good on technology. If you're thinking, if you're thinking it should make sense, it should. Gotcha. Okay, let's see. You see motorhome travel trailer. That's honestly all I'm seeing there because I said you know your Progressive documents are ready. I want to get view documents, but nothing else there. Just might go there. It's just bringing me to. Like the documents for the motorhome and things like that, so the declarations page. Yeah, I think it's just updating you on what I did. Oh, gotcha. You could not tell I'm completely new to the world of insurance. You get. ID card. Twenty-two Chevy Silver, effective nine eight twenty-five. And. Create a new upon this. Vance Auto. Go on that. Documents. Choose folder and. Double check that address. Yeah, there we go. It's right. And then. Email. I'm an email ID card. The new ID card. Jeffrey. I'll put it in the subject line. Progressive. I think new. Auto policy. Progressive. Effective nine eight twenty-five. Twenty-two Chevrolet Silver Auto. Alliance Insurance. You mind copying me on that as well? Yeah, just copy. Thank you. Trying to make this thing because I know if he reads it, just. New auto. Personal. It's probably better personal auto. Policy with Progressive. Effective nine eight twenty-five is all set. Up. See attached. ID card. A card if needed. Toby. D E R E K. Yes, sir. Thank you. And what's your phone number? My phone number is. Yeah, three three six four nine seven six one two seven. Okay. Did I attach? I don't think I attached ID cards. Let me resend it. Yeah, I got it here, but no. You want to do that? Oh. Okay. And then should we pull? Well, I'm gonna have my CSR pull his car off. Please pull. Twenty two Silverado. Off Sarah's. And auto policy. Okay. I did receive those that you just sent there to me. So. What else are we missing that he wanted? Let me look, make sure. See, accordion songs according to things. James, our turn on your grace. Ready signs coming up things happen soon. Change my dress. We found a new share of songs. However, I know I have Progressive Insurance. So I can run my lights. Great. I'll follow up. Renault and. Let's go. We meet. My truck. Progressive. I have a debit card. Cheaper discounts. Okay, let me double check with his policy list one more time. Make sure I'm seeing it. So no chance of reconciliation, huh? Well, not that I'm thinking, but you never know. You never know, but I pray. Hope he everything works out like it's supposed to. Yeah. Good deal. He'll bounce. He'll bounce back. Yeah, I think he'll be all right. He'll make it. See auto. Don't need touch that one. Don't need touch that one
