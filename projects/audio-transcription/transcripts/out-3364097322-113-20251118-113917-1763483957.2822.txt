Client. Hey, Mister Young, it's Gary. A lion. Hey, how you doing? Have you got them in it? Yeah. Okay. Have you got your other papers available to you there? Let me get in the other room here. I got them. Hang on one second. You talking about the stuff you sent me on email? Yes sir. Yes sir. Okay, I got them. Okay. Now for the umbrella coverage, you have to bump up your auto coverage, and I did that. I did that. I raised it from one hundred three hundred to two fifty five hundred. Okay. And with the discounts on there, the paid in full price is one thousand one hundred twenty four dollars and thirty cents. Okay. So that did go up a little bit from what we talked about before. On the homeowners, I changed the deductible on the wind and hail to five thousand. And all other loss occurrences would be twenty five hundred. Okay. And that reduced the premium to twenty three fifty nine on the home, and I did make those adjustments that we talked about before. On the dates of the different things. Correct. Correct. Okay, all right. But with the increased deductible, it brought the premium down to twenty three fifty nine. Yeah, okay, I like that. You know it looks. And then the umbrella for a million dollars is two twenty one a year. Okay. All right. Let's see. Have you added all this up, man? I have not. What I can real quick. I do it. Twenty three fifty nine plus. It comes out to three thousand seven hundred four, which I think is still less than what we're paying now. It is. Let me. I can give you the current figures on it to let you know what that what that would be. Okay. Progressive actually had you at fourteen seventy two for the auto. Yeah. And thirty one eighty five for the home. Right. So that's going to put you at about forty seven hundred. Thinking about thousand bucks. Yeah, overall you would be. Yes sir. Okay. Well, let's do it. Now, do you normally pay all of those at one time? I usually do. Yeah. Okay. That's what I like to do anyway. Okay. Does it make a difference? Sometimes you get a discount if you pay it all. You do. You do. So and and it's about one hundred and fifty dollars just on the auto policy. All right. What we would need to do is I need to get if you want to pay it all up front. When we release it, then we need to get the checking account numbers because the only way I can pay that is by checking account. Okay. You need like the routing number and account number stuff like that. Correct. That's correct. Hang on, and I'll get that to you. Okay. You just going to make a draft on the account then. Yes sir, and I can do it at any point between now and the well, we're going to be gone the twenty seventh, twenty eighth. So we need to do it before the Thanksgiving weekend. You can just go ahead and do it now, really. Okay. Or whatever. Would the policy start them when the other one ends, or how would that work? It will. It will start on the twenty ninth, and then once I release everything, I will send you for e signature on the new applications. Okay. And you would just e sign those, and they would come back to me, and then I would also send you non renewal or cancellation paperwork. To send a progressive, so that so that those don't renew. Okay. Let me just let me give you those numbers if you want them now. Okay, you can go ahead. Okay. The routing number it's First Citizens Bank, but it's zero five three one. Zero zero three zero zero. Okay. And the account number is zero zero five seven eight seven five. Three nine six six six. Six six six. Okay. Okay, I've got those now, and let me ask you this: Do you want me to get you signed up on the new policies? With online access, because I can give I can give you an email, and then that way they will set you up an account to where you can go in there and and look at anything that you want. Yeah. Okay.
