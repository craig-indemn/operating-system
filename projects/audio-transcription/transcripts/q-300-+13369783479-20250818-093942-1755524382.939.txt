Thank you for holding. This is Tracy. How can I help you? Yes, ma'am. This is Nancy Barlowson. I traded vehicles Saturday, and I'm just wanting to double check. Make sure that the Veloster got took on off, and that insurance got transferred to the new vehicle. Okay. When did you purchase the vehicle? Saturday. Okay. Yeah, I don't see that they have called it in yet. What kind of vehicle did you get? A 2022 Jeep Compass, four wheel drive, four door. Did you trade in anything? Yeah, traded the Veloster in. Okay, and did you transfer the tag? Uh no, he's he's going to put a thirty day tag on it. Okay, so you still have that tag then. Uh no, I don't. I need to get it. I don't know. Yeah, I'll have to turn that into the DMV. Yeah, so so they don't see it as a lapse in coverage. Yeah. Um. Let's see. Give me just one moment here. What I can do is I can. Take off the full coverage and just leave the liability, so that you can. You'll still meet the DMV requirements, but you're not paying a whole lot more for the insurance. As I add the other one as well. Okay, I'm going to need full full coverage on the Jeep Compass. Yes. Okay. Yes. You got a loan on that one. Yeah. Okay. Do you have the VIN number for the Compass? I will see now and see if we can find the VIN number. It's just a vehicle identification number. Uh. It's first owner. VIN number. Is three D four NJ. DDB one NT dash one nine zero zero three six. I think that's right. Okay, and which dealership did you get it from? Um. Foot Hill Ford. Foot Hill. Okay. And do you know who the loan is with? No, I don't. Okay, I can actually call Foot Hill and get that loan information from them so that we can make sure they know you have insurance. And then what we can do is drop that Veloster down to just liability only, and then as soon as you turn that tag in, then we can just take it off of there and you won't get a DMV fine. Okay. All right. Thanks. Okay, I'll get this out. All right. Thank you so much. You are welcome. Thank you. Have a good one. Thank you too. Bye bye.
