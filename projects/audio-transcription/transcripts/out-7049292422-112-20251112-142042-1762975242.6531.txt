Hello, it's Dave. Hey Dave, this is Brandi with Alliance. How are you? I'm pretty good, trying to get this disability stuff figured out. I don't know what the big deal is. Well, I did send you the policy, but you can tell your accountant that the policy getting paid it's after taxes. Because it's just coming right out of your account, your checking account. Right, it's uh. That's what I don't understand. So when y'all, how do you bill me? I know it sounds dumb. I know you bill me once a year, and then I pay monthly or every other month or something. So. Is that included that bill? Is it several different bills or is it one big bill? Give me one second. Let me see if I can see the the whole billing. It looks like that this um comes out of your checking account every month and it's 184 dollars and 82 cents. Why? Why do they need? I guess I'm confused on why all this is confusing. I know you are too. So I can print this billing statement or it's not really a statement but billing schedule that has happened in the past. And you can send that to them and see if that. You want to just email it to me and I mean she's got it she gets it. Yeah, I can email it to you. She's got to do that. Yeah, do that. I hate to keep bothering you. No, you're. But for some reason. Oh, while I got you on the phone, I still got the ex life on there as a beneficiary. I get that off. You women, I got I got to get that off. Okay. All right, let me see. So we need to remove Ronda Harrison. Absolutely. Okay, um, do you know who you would want to put in place besides her? Um, how about Saint Jude's? That's what I'm gonna end up changing everything over here eventually anyway, but. Saint Jude's will be. Okay. We fine. Let me reach out to auto owners and see about getting the form because it won't be a regular beneficiary form for that. And um. And I'll get back to you with that. That's fine. That's fine. I just happen to notice that one. Yeah, it'll be a form for me to fill out as far as um. The information for Saint Jude's, and then of course you signing it. To remove Ronda and add on that one. Yeah. So I'll reach out to you about that part. I did just send you the past billing schedule of what's been coming out and what account it comes out of. I just sent that to your email address, but if there's anything else I can do besides changing the beneficiary, let me know. I think I'll do it. I'll make sure she gets that, and then hopefully that'll be that'll be it. I just don't understand what the big. She should have all that information. You would think. Yeah, I mean if she if she if that's the business account that it's coming out of, she would see it come out of. I mean she would. She would have. Yeah. Unless it's something she's wanting to try and start doing. I mean if it comes out, it. Okay, if it comes out, pre tax, is there something we need to do with y'all or? No. It's not going to come out pre tax with y'all, is it? No. Okay. All right. Okay. Good work. Thank you, ma'am. All right, you're welcome. Have a good one. You too. Bye. Thanks. Bye.
