Hey Sophia, this is Dara, um, Emma's daughter. Girl. Hey. I know, I don't know. Do you guys have the right number on my account? Let me check. When have you changed it? But yes, I have, but it's been like I think around two years already, but I don't know if I just. Just have it updated on y'all side. Okay, let me see. Seven zero seven two two seven six. Yeah, that's the number we called. That's what we have. Oh, I haven't. I don't know if I. I haven't. I've seen my voicemail there, but I haven't really catch anything. Um, but I guess to let you know how the situation's going with my car. Currently in the process of selling it. Um, I wanted to see like if there's any like pending. Um, I guess invoices or payments that I have to make. To close that. So your insurance on that vehicle, the 2015 Honda. It canceled back in July. Okay. So. Do you have like? Do you still have a tag on it? No. No, you turn those in. No, I haven't turned them in yet, but I haven't. Um. What I haven't turned them in at all. Okay, so this this is why I wanted to talk to you because in North Carolina, you can't have an active tag and not have insurance on it. Um. You know even if the car's broke down, so if the car breaks down or you know you're trying to sell it. Right. If you have an active tag, you have to keep insurance on it. But now that you're trying to sell it, then if if you don't need the insurance, you don't want the insurance on that vehicle, that's fine. But what will happen is because those tags weren't turned in. Right. Um, you're going to get a fine from the state. There's nothing that you owe to the insurance policy with us because it expired back in July. Okay. But once you probably get another car or transfer that plate your plate to another vehicle, it's going to flag the system to say, Hey, this tag didn't have insurance. From July 6, let's say you go tomorrow to you know September 4, so they're going to ask you to pay a fine. Okay. As long as you pay that fine, you will be okay. Uh huh. How much the fine? It's about fifty dollars to two hundred dollars. It'll just depend. Okay. Right. Okay, so what do you recommend me doing then? So are you driving a car you don't need insurance? No, right now I'm driving my husband's car. Your husband's car. Okay, so then you you do. Ah, what I recommend is that you make sure you're on your husband's insurance policy. Yep, and that's all you need to do. Um. Do you have like a lot of interest in the car or? Because I'm I'm trying to figure out like if you think it's going to take you just a few days to sell it, then keep the tag on it. But if it's going to. Other than that, I would say go ahead and turn it in. Um. Depending you know where you live, some kind of places are like, no, you can't have a vehicle with no tag, so that you got to look at that. Okay. Um. I guess more for like I want to say two weeks, so I probably should turn them in. Yeah, if it's going to be longer than two weeks, I would I would turn them in. Okay. Um. To just be done with it, and like I said, once you sell it, you know somebody will come and take it. Right. And you may still get something. It'll probably go to your mom's house if you haven't updated your address with the TMD. To say that you have a fine for having no insurance on that tag. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, if we can help you in the future, you and your husband, you let me know. Okay. Okay. Hi, well, thank you very much. You're welcome. Bye. Thanks. Goodbye.
