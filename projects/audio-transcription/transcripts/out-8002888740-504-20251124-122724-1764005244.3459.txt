Auto Owners says Patricia, how can I help? I hate Patricia. My name is Holly. I'm with Alliance Insurance. I just had a billing account. I wanted to see if you could help me with, please. Sure. What's the number, ma'am? It's one zero three four four zero eight six nine. And the name on the account. Jeffrey Colep. And let's see here your agency code. That is fifteen zero three nine four zero zero. Perfect. Thank you for that. And what would you like? So on the billing, the original renewal, or when we issued the policy, it was ninety four ninety eight for a monthly payment. We added a travel trailer and it added the four forty seven forty one. He paid that the four forty seven. Okay. But now the payments are showing one forty four and not the original ninety four. So I was. He wants to inquire about that. Sure. So we had that new business is one thousand one ninety nine. And all right, so let me. Okay, so what I'm showing, ma'am, now the total term premium is sixteen forty two and twenty eight cents. And if I divide that by twelve, it shows me one thirty six eighty six as the monthly payments on us. So let me just check one other thing. So we have July, August, September, October. November. So we are paid up until. November. So now we're billing for December, and that's where we get. The one forty four because. The payment for October was only the eighty one dollars. And seventy four cents, which is what we billed for. Let me think about this. Six eighty four. It looks like they had six twenty nine. Okay, let's see. So it looks like what they paid and what. They got billed for that. I can't reallocate because now we're billing for December. Let's see where else. Looks like we got a payment back in July and that was for a hundred dollars. And again, the payment should have been like one thirty six, so we were shorted a little bit there. Um. So then we go with a nine. On that first payment, it was only billing for ninety four ninety eight. That was the renewal, right? And I. I see that ma'am, and and it looks to me like automatic payments were turned off right around that time. And then they made the payment for the four forty seven forty one. So the bill for July went out and that would have been August payment. And then they paid that larger payment. To pay out that renewal, but didn't pay the ninety four ninety eight. You get that. Can you look at history with me? Yeah, I'm in there. Okay, so we didn't get a separate payment for ninety four ninety eight. We just got the four forty seven forty one, which like you said paid for that policy change. So then they decided to turn the automatic payments on. And we only charged for the eighty one seventy four that took care of November and now we're kind of back on track a little higher. We're probably trying to make up for that ninety four now. So let's just see for that. Well, the hundred dollars and nine cent on seven nine, not the renewal payment. Well, yeah, because this was built. This was just built. So that we got the hundred dollars and then we billed for ninety four ninety eight and we never got that. So if you took that amount and divided maybe by the remaining payments one two three four five six seven. Let's just see. I think I'm following you now. That was confusing. Yeah. Exactly. So the normal payment should be about one thirty six. We have about a thirteen dollar difference from that ninety four dollar. So that's why they are now one hundred and forty four seventy two. Okay, all right. I think I got it now. Let him know. All right, good for you because I struggle with that obviously. So. All right. Anything else? That's it. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a wonderful Thanksgiving. You too. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye.
