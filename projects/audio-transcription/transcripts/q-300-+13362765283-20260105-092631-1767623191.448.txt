All right, do you have that VIN number handy? Uh, the VIN number is one N four A L three A three J C one three zero seven nine zero. Okay. Twenty eighteen Nissan Altima. Yes. Okay. Did you want to add it with the same coverage that you have that twenty twenty one Jeep Gladiator on? Yes, full coverage. Okay. And what you said Saturday was the purchase date. Yes, the third. Okay, we'll go ahead and get this processed in the system. I'm just going to verify all the information we just went over.
