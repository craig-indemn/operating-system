Hey Thomas, it's Zena with Alliance Insurance. I wanted to call and let you know I did call Progressive this morning to see about you know getting that paperless credit you know showing back on here. And and so there is that thirty five cent amount that's left over. They said they that's not something that they can waive off, but they're not actually going to bill you for it. It's it's not enough I guess for the system to issue a bill. So that that thirty. You like on your renewal like August the first two thousand and twenty six it would show up on that bill. So I did want to let you know if you want to call me and you just want to go ahead and pay that thirty five cent you know I'll be happy to take that payment for you over the phone or if you just want to wait you can absolutely do that too okay. So let me know if you have any questions about this. Our number is three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Okay, thanks so much. Have a good day. Bye bye.
