Good morning, I am Andrew Jones. Hey, yes, ma'am. I was just wondering if I could get a COI sent out to one of my builders. They just called me today. Okay, all right. What is? Let me see here. Yeah, you're good. I know I'm supposed to like do the email and all that. I know that's my fault. No, you're good. I'm trying to figure out who the best agent is to get you over to to help you out. Oh, it's usually Jessica. I think I don't know if she still that's what I usually do the emails with. Hernandez, she might not need to be working now. It's been a while. Yeah, she is actually working. Or should I just email her? Well, whatever, whatever you recommend. It's no really no rush. Well, the reason why I was looking because it looks like in the past Gloria has been. It looks like she's been in your file here. She's one of the agents here. So I'm wondering if I should send it to her. Whatever works for you. Okay, hold tight just a second. Let me get you over here if that's okay. That is perfect. Thank you. All right. Now, if something happens and you know she doesn't answer, if you'll leave her the information, she can definitely give you a call back. Okay. Ah, sure will that'll work. All right, hold on just a moment. You have to get there. Hold on. You too.
