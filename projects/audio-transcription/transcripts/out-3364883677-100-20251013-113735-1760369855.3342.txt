Oh, hey, is this Robin? It is Robin. This is Brandi with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm just fine. Almost forgot about you. I called you about my sister's apartment. Yes. Um. So I quoted it with progressive, and for a 12 month, renter's policy with the same coverage, it would be 131, and 15 cents. A month or a year. That's for the year. Oh wow. Doesn't sound bad. I'll need to check with her. It's um, obviously her policy. So so if I just get approval from her and I get a check from her, I can bring it over to you and you can start things. Or how do we do this? Yes. So good. Okay, so it was that was 131. And 15. 13115. Okay, and that's for a year. Yes. And that's going to cover everything that the other one. Because you have the other policy, you know what it covered. It's going to be the same as the other one. Yes, exactly the same. Okay. So so if I talk to her, I get a check from her, I bring it to you, we can get things started. Yes, ma'am. All right. Who should make the check out to? Uh, she can make it out to Alliance. Alliance Insurance. I would say she'd pay by card, but she's not very good at that. Make it out to Alliance. Yes, ma'am. Okay. I will be. And I'm talking to him. Brandi. Brandi. All right, Brandi. Well, I will check with her and I'll get back with you today. Okay. Thanks so much. You're welcome. Bye. Bye bye.
