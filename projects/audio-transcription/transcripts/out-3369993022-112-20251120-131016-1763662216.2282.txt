Hello. Hey Jessica, it's Brandy with Alliance. Hey Brandy. Um, so I got your text and I was just wondering if you had a few minutes to go over this quote together. Yeah, of course. Okay. Well, let me get logged back into National General. Give me one second. Okay. Okay. Okay, so for this quote, um, it does have both of you as drivers. Um, under one vehicle, the the way that I have it set up, is that your son only drives the 2020 Nissan Rogue as an occasional operator, so he's not a full time operator of the vehicle. So you share half the risk and so does he and that's why the cost is lower. Okay. If there's any chance that you would buy, you know, an older vehicle and whenever I think I still think of an older vehicle as a 2000 something. Yeah. Or like 1990. That's an old vehicle to me still. But you know, we got to consider you know 2010 to be old now. So. Okay. Anything 2010 and older, I would say that you would be okay at not having a big jump. On the policy, if he was to be a full operator on that year, of a vehicle. Now you do have to think about making sure that it's not a sports vehicle, it's not an SUV, it's not a truck. Okay. Those are going to cost more, even with it being an older vehicle. Okay. So like a Honda Civic, Honda Accord. Yeah. You know even like a Toyota Camry or Corolla something like that. I know it's not like, you know, for him it may not be cool to drive, but on the part where to make it cheap, it's going to be cheaper on insurance. Yeah, understood. But if you do something like that, it would only, um, it wouldn't raise it as much as anything else. Now I have ran all the reports on this, um, on this quote. So this is like as accurate as it's going to get. So if you move to National General, your down payment would be. Three hundred and twenty. Hold on. Two fifty five hundred rental and towing. Rental towing. Let's run ten miles. Okay, so your down payment is going to be you know roughly around three thirty, and then your monthly payments are going to be two sixty nine. Wow, yeah, that's huge because then I'll be able to pay for my car. Um, and how soon can I start it? I mean, we can do it today if you want to. If you're good with making the down payment of three, about three thirty. Um, because I know Utica, they draft out my insurance on the 28th. So um. So I have so I have enough time to take that policy off of AutoPay. Okay. And then we can just you know, um. Have you sign a cancel form for the day that we start the new policy, and then we'll cancel that Utica, but taking it off of AutoPay first would be the main thing. There, Brandy. I think I lost you. But I mean, I I can start the National General policy whenever you are good to make the the first down payment because that that will definitely have to be made, the day that I start the policy.
