Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hey Brandi, this is Bill Bishop. I talked to you earlier this morning. Yes. Okay, I got that van for that vehicle. All right. What is that van? Okay, and also the one I gave you for the Audi the 2009. We're gonna he's not going to get insurance on it. He's going to turn the tag in. So this regard, so we just need insurance on the Chevy Cruze. Okay, well for that Audi, you'll need to turn in the tag before he discontinues any insurance that he has right now because if he doesn't and he cancels the insurance or doesn't have insurance on it and then he goes and turns in the tag he's going to get a fine from the state and owe them money. I don't think he's got insurance on it, does he now? I don't think he does because he's not driving it. He didn't ever get it inspected, so he let the tag lapse. Just do both for now, we'll figure it out. Well, I would just let him know. Well, I mean, if the tag is expired, then it won't matter whether he has insurance on it or not. But prior to that, whenever it was up to date, if he didn't have insurance on it, he will have a lapse. I would just let him know. Okay. I mean, they'll tell him whenever he goes and turns in the tag for it if he owes them any money. Okay. All right, sounds good. But that would be the reason why. But I'm ready with that other VIN number. Okay, it's one G is and George, one P is and Paul, H is and Harry, five S is and Sam, C is and Charlie, six C is and Charlie, seven one one seven five zero three. All right, in 2012 Chevy Chevy Cruze. Yeah, he's actually living Wilmington, but he's moving back home, moving back in with us next weekend. Okay, no problem. We can go ahead and I'll get quotes on this and give you a call back and let you know how much it's going to cost. Now I'm guessing, do you? I mean, it is your policy. He will be a named insured since he owns the vehicle. But do you know like what type of coverage you may want or do you want to do comprehensive inclusion or just liability only? Just liability only. Okay. That's what he's got now, and same coverage. I guess. All have the same liability limits as you have. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah, those will be the same. That'll be fine. Okay. All right. Well, I'll go ahead and get this processed and I'll give you a call back before we leave today and let you know how much it's going to be. Okay. Okay, y'all do run his report on his driver's license, right? Yes, we do. Okay. All right, sounds good. I'll wait to hear back from you. All right. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Bye.
