John. Hey John, it's Jessica with the Lions again. I thought of something after we got the phone. I would just make sure that they classified that subcontractor correctly. What what does he do for you exactly? Like is he a like a. One of one of them is is an electrician, is a licensed electrician. Okay. And the other one is just a carpenter, you know. Oh okay. And actually out there throwing a hammer and stuff. Look, actually the one that I paid the most. I just I was just paying him a fucking referral fee. He didn't even do any work. You know I'm saying he's fucking. I just gave him like a bunch of money to get me that job. Okay. Every set of the jobs I didn't do any work. Okay. So then yeah, I was going to say I would dispute the audit then with the company and then obviously make sure that they have that electrician class as an electrician not as carpentry because carpentry is a highest. The highest you can have. Okay. And in that referral as well, explain that to him like tell them he wasn't out there swinging a hammer doing work like. Yeah, so it's more like I didn't. Yeah. So he could be more like a what are they called like a feat like a. Yeah, I kind of. Yeah, that's not like a yeah. I I could have him put that in writing. Yeah, man, it's a referral fee. He didn't do any fucking work. It's just like he got me the job. You know. Um. Damn. Uh. Man, I know you didn't know. No, you're good. Hopefully that works. Okay, let me. Halley. I'm gonna save my life. I hope. I hope. God Jessica, I really do appreciate all your help. I can't get any help out of this other agent. She's terrible. I don't know if you ever heard of her. She's some I named Renee Flacco. I can't remember damn company she works for. Oh no. But uh, fucking terrible. That's what I needed right there. That's exactly what's what's going to be. I mean, I got the one guy classified as a carpenter. He's not. The other guy he was just getting paid a referral fee. So that's that's the that's the ticket. Are you ten thousand dollars? All right, hopefully that works. I appreciate. Have a good day. Thanks, Jessica.
