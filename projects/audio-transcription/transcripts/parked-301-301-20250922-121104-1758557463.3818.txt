Hey Vivian, it's Addison. Addison, are you going to be in the office this afternoon? I am. Well, I have gone to the garage, and the guy has given me an estimate on my car, and he said I could bring it up there in the morning. So I just wanted to take this by to you, and I guess in the world that you're in, this is probably an insignificant amount. So I thought it would probably be all right to take it because I have to pay the first five hundred dollars and it's seventeen hundred and some dollars to fix it. Okay. So I'll bring this by to you in a little while. Okay. Okay, sounds good. I'll be here. Bye bye.
