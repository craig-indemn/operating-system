Good morning, Alliance Insurance. Good morning, this is Lena at Motor and Chevy. I am calling for one of your customers that purchased a vehicle from us, and we just need to verify insurance. Okay, all right, very good. Um, what's the insurance name? Uh, I have Alicia Winfrey. And Randy, I don't know if it's under both names. And what's the address? Let's see here, thirty nine fifty five Lean Beach Drive. Well, I pulled up the wrong one. Do you happen to have the policy number? Oh yes, let's see here. I have nine six three four zero seven five three three. Okay, so the address is three nine five five, is it Lean Beach Drive in Winston Salem? Okay, so I've got the auto policy pulled up here. I'm going to see if I can help you, but if I can't, I can see if I can get you over to an agent. Um, so what can we help you with? Uh, so they bought a vehicle from us on the twenty sixth. I just need to verify that it has been added to their insurance, and I need the deductible and effective date. Let's say twenty twenty six Trailblazer. I'm just looking here. Okay, so what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get over to an agent. Um, make sure they. Because I'm not sure if I'm looking at this correctly or not. Um, so okay, just a moment. Okay. Thank you. Mhm.
