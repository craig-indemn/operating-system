If you get a chance today, Daniel, please take a look at your email. I sent over an email with an attachment. It's the initial down payment invoice on your auto owner's general liability policy. Take a look at that. Give me a call back. Email me back if you have any questions or concerns. I'll talk you through it. I'll walk you through it. We need to get this initial down payment knocked out with that invoice, and then from there we can set up the monthly auto draft. Look forward to hearing from you, Daniel. Thank you, sir.
