Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hey Brandi, this is Anchored Medlock. How are you? Good. How are you? Doing well, doing well. I received your email and your voicemail. I think the only thing I need is an endorsement page that has both drivers on it, me and my son Julian. Okay. Um. Is that something that the dealership needed? That's what I need tonight for the dealer. Yeah. Okay, because it takes. Typically, they're just okay with the, the binder as is because you're the owner of the policy. Is the car going to be in his name? Yes, I'm putting it in his name. Okay. Because I can't, I can't alter the binder. And. I don't know if the policy is ready yet for actual documents. Uh huh. Um. Since he's already on the policy as a driver. So the thing is that if he's going to be the owner of the vehicle, we would have to make him a named insured on the policy. But I wouldn't. That's since I've already made one change. I can't make another change on the policy. Um, because I have to wait until this change goes through, which takes 24 to 48 hours, and then by like Monday or Tuesday, I will be able to make another change to the policy. But um. I'm just I'm trying to think of what I can do. Just send it. I mean, if I know I'm already making another change and he is going to be the owner, I could put him on the binder. Uh huh. Along with you, that would be perfect. Let me see. Okay, so let me retype up a binder because I won't be able to give you the one that has auto owners on it like I did before. So I'm just going to type up one from us, that will have both, both names on there. And then is the lien holder going to be JP Morgan Chase Bank? Yeah. Okay. Okay, because I think he had called in and he said that it was going to be. With Tesla Lease Trust or something. Oh. So I wasn't sure. Oh. Okay, I need to confirm. Let me confirm. Hang on, maybe or don't. Yeah, no, no, no. You're fine in the process. In the meantime, I'll start typing this binder up for you. Okay. Okay, I just typed my information. The bank is JP Morgan, but Tesla requires that you add them as an interested party. Okay. Okay, so I have their information. Uh huh. So I'll just put them and JP Morgan Chase Bank on this document and I'll send it over to you. Just look it over and make sure that everything looks okay. Okay. Do close at five and I can text you. That way you can text me saying that everything looks good. That way you don't. Perfect. Perfect, perfect, perfect. Thank you so much. Yeah, you're welcome, and I will follow up with you on making him a named insured since his name's going to be on this car. There might be something that we need to sign, but I'll follow up with you probably in the middle of next week. Okay. Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Have a good day. You too. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye.
