Thanks for patient holding this. I'm Bonnie speaking. Hey, I'm Bonnie. This is Aj calling you back, but. Hey, how you doing, man? Good, how are you? I'm doing great. Sorry, playing a little phone tag here. A little bit, but um. That's all. Yeah, Bonnie, I was I was reviewing this one again and talking to nationwide about it, and it's just too small right now. There's not really much we could do with the exposure they have, and. It's it's just too small to support what they're doing right now. You know we're looking at less than ten thousand dollars here for. You know I'm not really concerned about most of these classes, but. The one that's really the kicker is the fifty five thirty seven. You know they are doing some welding in that class and things like that. You know anything less than ten grand is just like. You know one claim is going to put this thing upside down in two seconds. You know. Um. It's just tough right now until this thing grows and it could support what they're doing. Um. Yeah, we're gonna have to probably take a pass here. I understand what you're saying. So I mean, what what is what is you know the premium size that you guys are going to be more comfortable with? I mean, for what they're doing, I would want this thing above twenty five thousand. Okay. You know um basically you know like anything ten thousand unless I kind of really only want like desk work clerical work. You know maybe a little bit of light industrial if they're packing boxes and stuff like that. We could get away with that, but as far as if they're actually doing some manufacturing work in machines, especially your. Your HVAC refrigeration class or fifty five thirty seven that's that's some tough exposure there where. Like I said, one thing could upset this whole account. So understand. Well, yeah, thank you for getting back to me. You know, give me updates. Yeah, I'll definitely kind of you know notate our council if we know where we can go. Yeah, and I'm gonna I'll send you a quick email before the end of today just to so you have a full declaration and you can save it to the file whatever. But I just wanted to give you a buzz quick first. Okay, man. I definitely appreciate it. Thank you for your help. You got it. Have a good one and thanks for the business too. Okay, okay.
