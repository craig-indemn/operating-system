Hello. Tracy. Yes, this is Tracy. Hey Tracy Karen Higer, I was just calling for follow up to see if you heard anything from the vast amount of people you emailed last week. We've been chatting back and forth and they're checking over the figures to see if there's any additional owed. Um, give me one second. There's three checks that I don't see. Let me see here. That have been sent to the contractor yet? Um, have the let's see here. The forty eight eighty five, the fourteen fifty five fifty five and the four seventeen twenty three were those paid to the contractor. Everything I have received from Utica was sent to the contractor. Okay, do you have any? Did he give you a receipt for those three? No. Okay. How much were those amounts? Um. First one four thousand eight eighty five sixty. Four thousand eight eighty five sixty. Okay. Second amount. Seven uh no one or fourteen thousand five hundred fifty five cents. Okay. And third one four hundred seventeen dollars and twenty three cents. Okay. No, all the checks I give to him to carry out the work he was doing and he didn't give me receipts. I didn't know I needed receipts when he was the contractor. Uh, you know. I think I have the stubs on all three of those where I cash those. Uh and give him the uh or a positive. I think I did and just wrote him a check. I can't remember. But uh, you know I do not get a receipt from him. But any check that uh. I received from Utica. I got him cash and give them to him to to do the to do the work. Okay, so then. The only thing we're trying to determine because between what he has sent to them on the invoices the final invoices. Um and what you've already received. It looks like there's only like a seventeen hundred dollar difference. So I'm having him figure out where that came from and where it's at. Okay, seventeen hundred dollars that you can't find what on Tracy that. Everything else you've that you've received all the you've received all the checks that. That Utica has been out. Yep. Yeah. And when you subtract the invoices that he sent to Utica. For each location, their final invoices. It only leaves a balance of seventeen hundred dollars. So when you subtract the invoices he sent. To Utica, it only left around seventeen hundred dollars. Correct. So I'm having him track that. Have been any checks drafted to him? No. No, it went to you guys. Yes, okay. I just wanted to make sure. And what we had was the whole thing was fifty eight thousand dollars and some change. Is how much they paid us altogether, and that's what we had given him. And we was due about fifty eight hundred. Ten percent of that. When. When you say how much you received, are you adding up both properties or just one? All of all of its one stake. Well, I show that you've received thirty six thousand four seventeen. On one claim and you've received forty nine thousand nine forty five on the other. Forty thousand forty nine thousand. Nine forty five sixteen. So total of all this claim was seventy seven thousand. For the two claims. Let me look here. So between the two claims, Utica has paid eighty six thousand three hundred sixty two dollars and fifty one cents. On the scope of practice. You add six thousand nine hundred eighty four of that. That's what they told would be due unless. It cost you know if it costs more than or if they found more damage. Than what they. You know had anticipated. So if you add if you add that what I said six thousand eight hundred fifty four six six thousand nine hundred to what you just said that number was. That's what that's what they sent us in the mail or telling us that that's how much it would pay. Where are you getting the six thousand from? Because I'm telling you the number that you just told me is six thousand. Sure. No, no, one thousand seven hundred and sixteen dollars. No, what I'm telling you over the scope of practice that they sent us the first contract the way we even got this contract. It showed him you know here's how much they've allowed. Can you do the work for that? If you add six thousand dollars. To that price you just told me, then that's gonna be that's gonna be what the papers sent to us. So the scope of practice what they would allow for unless they found more damage that was undiscovered by the adjuster. Yeah, in that case you would have to submit a supplemental. To Utica along with photos to support any additional damage that he found. We didn't find any that we didn't find any that all we're trying to do is get them to pay what they send us paperwork out to start Okay, and that was for two hundred eight four and that was the final invoice for. Correct. Okay. Now, this is higher than that. Yeah. The reason being, is one of the bills is to ensure our house is across the street. So. And that confused everybody. Everybody has been confused on this thing. So when he signed in invoices, it. So I guess the best thing we knew is go back and go through and him submit to us invoices that. What the work he's already done, and then when we complete this work, we submit invoices to us. Of how much this cost, and we'll get them to yawn. That's all I know to do from now. Yeah, I would get the invoices from him. We thank you for spending time for us. Oh, you're welcome. I mean, it's just a freaking mess as far as that goes. Is the case closed still? Well, I don't mind. They said they could open it back if you need to. Yeah, it's not unusual that a case closes once a payment's been issued. It happens all the time. They just reopen it. So they can do that at any point in time. What we're saying. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Okay, okay. Well, what I will do. When is our policy due? Will be spoke here. Let me just take a look. Thank you. I think there's no wonder. I got the final invoice right here for the thirty six thousand four hundred and seventeen dollars. Yeah. I've got that on my. None of it. Oh, because it ain't done. You know I've got what it says right here though. You're saying you last. But yes, no, it says on here final invoice for depreciation owed. Was thirty six thousand four hundred and seventeen thirty five, and that was the check she said was wrote for thirty six thousand four hundred and seventeen thirty five. And that's where he sent it to them, and let's see what the other is. When did you say it was due, ma'am? I'm sorry we both had issues with one. Uh, November 15th is when the policy renews. I thought it was November. Okay, well we got to do something soon now. Then I'm not going to renew with them. Oh yeah. Yeah, that's not a problem. If y'all, you know, I hope y'all can write with somebody else. If you can't, you know I don't know what we're going to do, but this has been so aggravating and these folks just cut us off and will not talk. That's like his boss. You tell my sister, what's her name? Christina. Christina Coach or whatever name. Her boss is supposed to go on, but he already told us a year ago as far as these. He was done. He won't pay no more and he wanted to have our money. Investigated because we called the North Carolina Insurance Commissioner. Well, at that point they wouldn't talk to us. You wouldn't talk to us either. You couldn't talk to the owner. He said, "Well, why it's going on with them? We can't talk to you. Owner of your company. So it's just been one heck of a mess." But yeah, we chose the wrong contacter. Yeah, we gave him the money at, you know, half past asleep. We should have got more of the work done before we gave him the lines to her the money, and that's my part. Well, what you need to do is get him to provide you an invoice for each location. So you'd have to have two of them, and have him list on those invoices exactly what he's already done. And what he's been paid for. Correct. And what we like to do. And what's left now? The company doesn't pay for any upgrades, and if he's charging them more than what's usual and customary, they don't pay that either. Well, he's going by the scope of practice. He put exactly what routes we had on that same company and everything. Both of us have had one within the last six years of their storm. And so he put exactly what on there. There's no upgrades, just included it all. In fact, we've already paid for downspouts that. He didn't pay for and nobody's been billed for them yet, so we've got to put them in here. So what he needs to do is provide an invoice for each house, each location. On what's been done and needs to be done, blessed. Correct. Correct. That would help. And send it to you. Send it to you guys and send it to me. Okay, uh, what is your email there? It's Tracy. Okay. T R. T R A C Y. At. At. My allianceinsurance dot com. My
