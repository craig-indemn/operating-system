Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hey Brandi, how are you? Good. How are you? I'm good as well. So I was just checking. We talked about this some weeks ago, but I never did get an email. You may have sent it, but I just didn't get it concerning life insurance for my wife. Okay, let me see. And this is Marvin. Yeah. All right, bear with me just one second. I gotta log into the company. Okay. I'm gonna put you on a brief hold while I get all this pulled up. Okay. All right, thanks. You're welcome. Oh. Oh. Okay, Marvin. Are you still there? I am. Okay, I am. Do apologize. Um, it took forever to get signed in because password needed to be reset. Okay. All right, so we did look at Cincinnati. Um, and I thought I had emailed these quotes to you, but I do not see my email anywhere. Um, but I did look at Cincinnati. Um, and I did look at a whole life policy. So that way, it is you know permanent, um, a permanent policy. It's going to last the rest of her life. And we did and I did look at 100, 000 150 and 250, um, just to see what that would look like. Now starting out at you know 100, 000 that is the least, um, the smallest amount. So going monthly, if you're looking at it that way, as far as making payments on it, it's 209 monthly. Now that could change a little bit depending on how they rate her diabetes, but I do have it standard. I have it at like the the highest rating that I can actually quote, um, but since the diabetes is a little bit of a risk factor, um, it just depends on what they put on there. I don't foresee it like going up any more than, you know, nothing like 100 more or anything like that. Okay. But then for like 150, it's 312 monthly, and then for 250, we're looking at 518 dollars. Um, I don't recommend getting anything temporary like a term life because that's not going to last forever, and it's going to be a little bit more expensive after 20 or 30 years for her to get something then. Okay. So it's definitely, um, it's definitely better for her to get a whole life. Now this is just Cincinnati. Um, I can look at auto owners to see what. Their pricing would be. I foresee it being about the same, but with Cincinnati with their whole life, the max or the minimum amount. Is 100, 000 that you can get with them? If I look at another company, we can lower that you know to 50 or 80, 000. Whatever to get that monthly amount feasible for you guys. Okay. At the same time, could you also do term for me as well? Just to look at the the difference of the amount we will have to pay. Yeah. So if you do a term, and I do, I mean it is going to be cheaper, but it's not going to be cheaper in the long run for you. Right. So let me see if I can do return of premium. I don't think I can. Hold on. Okay, so if we do a 20 year term, and if you do a return of premium, um, at the end of 20 years, you will get all of the money that you had put into this policy back. So every single monthly premium that would be the only way that I recommend you to do a term life. That way you're getting something back that you can either put into a a permanent whole a permanent life insurance policy for her or you just put that in saving somewhere. Um, but if you do this, um, it would be for 150, 000. It would be 327 dollars. So going the whole life route with 150 is cheaper than the term life. Okay. The whole life for 150 was 312 dollars. Okay. Sixty plus 25, so 60 in 25 years, she'll be 85. Right. That's what. So at age 85, if at the end of the 25 years, if she is still living, you're going to get all of that money back. If she passes within that 25 years, then you'll get the 150, 000. Okay. Convert the. That's with the term life.
