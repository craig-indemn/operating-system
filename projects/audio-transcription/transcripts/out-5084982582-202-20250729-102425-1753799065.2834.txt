Hello. Hey, this is Heather with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Hello. Can you hear me? I can now. Yeah. Okay, sorry. This is Heather with Alliance Insurance. So, I just sent a invitation to you from Auto Owners for you to sign electronically, or Jeremy to sign. And then, as far as payment, you can make payment on the portal or we can make it over the phone. But I have sent. You should have emails from Auto Owners that just came through. I do see that. Okay. So you can go that way. Credit card. There is a portal where you can go in and make a credit card payment. It would be the one and six for the year. Again, if if they move out, you know the end of May or whatever the case may be, then we can always cancel it when they move out. Okay. All right, yeah, I can probably just do it through the portal then. Should be fine. Yeah, if you have any issues, just let me know. Otherwise, I'm going to send the evidence of insurance. I don't think that I was ever sent the the information for the additional interest. If something needs to be listed for the the apartment or the home that they're going to be in, so if something needs to be listed for that, let me know and we can get it added as well. Well, I'm not sure what you mean there. So an additional interest would be like the property management group that owns the the residence. Oh, I got you. Yeah, they might want to be listed, but otherwise. Yeah, they do. They actually do. It said like that's part of the in the rental agreement. They say that they have to be included as a additional party whatever. Okay, if you want to shoot that over to me, I can get it added, and then resend or send you the evidence of insurance for them listed so you can upload that or. Or have that ready. Or you got. So you didn't get you don't have that for the other policies that you did. I just looked at Devine's and I don't think it's on that one either. So I would need to go in on both of those and get it added. Yeah, okay. Yeah, because I just look at his before before I did yours and it's not on there. So. Okay, so we just need the management company or the the owner or whatever they they name and address and we're and I can easily add those. Okay. All right. If you have any questions, just let me know. Great, thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good day. You too. Bye bye.
