Hello. Hey, is this Marvin? Speaking. Hi, Marvin. Hello, Scott. I think Carrie was going to text you to give you a heads up. I will be calling. Okay. How are you? Good, good. Good. So I was telling her your lender had requested a bonder for your home insurance. I need to get that sent over to them, but I was explaining to her that so the home and auto is kind of packaged together. And she said, "You know that I know she mentioned that she had said you didn't want to start the auto just yet." Yeah, yeah, you want to just do the house, and that way we keep it the same way we've been doing it before. At least for now, and you know until we, I guess by sometime next year we're going to decide when we can get into the car. Yeah. Yeah. Because they would. We wouldn't be able to do that. I would have to go out and requote it because Cincinnati requires you to bundle. Most of our carriers do. They require you to do home and auto together. And that is going to have any effect in the transition of the mortgage or not. It's going to. It should be a problem or not. No, no, it's it's it's still through Cincinnati, but see, I will send your homeowners the six hundred. I think it was six. Do you remember right off the top? Let me see. I don't remember Scott getting called. So what I'll send your lender is the just the home insurance. Okay, it's going to be that will be entered in. It's six hundred and fifteen dollars for the year. Okay. If it makes sense, just bundle everything I want. Scott and like like you like you wanted to do it. Okay. And then I just want to get this out of our heads right now because she's going to a surgery next week for eye surgery. So I don't want to you know like if if it's simple that way if it's not going to be no problem. There going to be no problem with the lender that way the housing everything is transferred over. I think let's let's get it done you know. Okay. No, no, no. The lender is just going to get the homeowners and that's like I said it's one hundred and fifteen. For the year for the homeowners and they will take care of that. The auto, so I will just need the payment for the auto policy. Okay, so that's it. Doesn't have to do with the house. I can give you. Okay. What is the easiest way for you guys to get it done then? Then for the auto. So I can take a credit card or I can do your routing and account information, a debit credit card or your bank information. Now how do you do you usually pay for the year? Sometimes get the doctor every month out of my checking account. Okay, I can set it up that way. It's totally to you. Yeah, it's fine that way then you know. Do we do draft? Yes, monthly draft should be okay. Let me see. Okay, so if we do the monthly draft, Marvin, I will need your routing and account information. Hold on one second. Let me see if I have a check on me right now. Okay. That I can give you that information. And who is your auto three right now? What I mean, the company. Yes. As Geico. Okay, so you will need to cancel your Geico policy. Okay. Twelve. No, no, no, no, no. Twelve fifteen. Twelve fifteen. I. Yeah. Let me. We're going to keep your home and auto together. It'll both be on twelve fifteen. They said you are closing on twelve fifteen. Is that correct? That's what that's what they sent the paperwork to my wife. Yeah, correct. That's what they sent me. Okay, so so your home and auto will begin on twelve fifteen. Fifteen. So twelve fifteen. So Geico. Okay, twelve fifteen. I cancel Geico. Okay, no problem. So I have my routing number right here. And this account is on the both, onto my name, onto my wife's name too. Okay. I see checking account. Yeah, you. If you are ready, I'll give you the numbers. I am ready for the routing number. Uh huh. Your routing number is zero twenty one. Zero zero zero. Three twenty two. Let me repeat it to you. Okay. Routing routing number is zero twenty one. Zero zero zero. Three twenty two. And the account number, the account number for this checking is zero zero. Seven zero eleven seventy nine. Seven zero four seven. Uh, repeat it to you. Account number is zero zero. Seven zero eleven seventy nine. Seven zero four seven and it's on the both
