Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? I need to ask a question. Okay, what kind of question? When you put a. I'm sorry. Yeah, I was just saying, what's your question? Maybe I can help you. If you put a young fellow on, mean do I need to put a young fellow on my insurance to get a learner's permit? Yes, because when he goes to get that permit, they will ask for his like for insurance. Um, but let me let me double check on that. Give me one second. The form that I've got says they need it when they get a license, but it doesn't say they need it to get a permit. So that's why I'm calling. Gotcha. Okay, well let me just verify. Give me one second. Okay, so yeah, um, it's not you won't need the document now for the permit, but we would need to list them. That way, when he does get the license, we can just give you that document right away. Okay. Okay, so did you want to go ahead and do that? He don't need the insurance for a permit. Correct. He does not. Okay. I'll call you back then. Okay. All right. Thanks. Bye bye.
