Thank for holding, Miss Gary. Hi Gary, yes, we have a phone call yesterday. I think it was branded. It called about our rental property that the premium was going up and the amount of coverage was going up and I was just calling to see what kind of information you have so I can relay the message. To my husband, who he can't stand. Okay, what's your name, ma'am? My name is Darlene. The policy is under Charles Dwayne Cook and Tiffany Cook and Chadwick Cook. Okay. He was at work and he couldn't talk, so he asked me to call back this morning. That's okay. The address on it. Yeah, the address. Charlie, is that right? Pardon me. What's your husband's name? It's Charles Dwayne Cook. Charles, okay, I thought you said that. He has another. Brandy is yeah, Brandy's out today and tomorrow, but um. It's okay. I'll get it for you. You guys are in Danbury, correct? Danbury is thirteen twenty-three Cook Road. Twenty-three Cook Road. You need the policy number. If you have it, that would be good because I'm putting it up. Four two eight five. I'm sorry. Four two eight five seven eight nine two zero one. Two one. I should ask you that to begin with. That's okay. No problem. Okay, now we'll make it some headway here. Okay, great, and that's with auto owners. It is. But they've got your billing address at twenty eight forty two Highway Eight North. That is correct. Okay. The location, like the location of the policy, is thirteen twenty three Cook Road, Danbury. That the bill comes to that address at two eight forty two and. Yeah. Okay, based on what she the message she left yesterday. Okay. Is the company has redone the replacement cost calculation on the house? Okay. And they are going to increase the coverage, which is normally going to cause a price increase, but she does not know how much that's going to be because it hasn't come out yet. Okay. Um, the replacement cost. Yeah, I don't know what the replacement cost in it is on it right now, but it's the rebuild cost basically and that's what they base all of the premiums on is the rebuild cost. Now, um, she did talk to him to see if said he need to make some changes or try to get it moved. But. To get it moved. To get the coverage moved to a different company. Oh, okay. That's going to be hard to do because of the age of the roof. Right. Well, that's the reason I'm calling is because I need to know what the increase is and the replacement cost in order to decide what's going to be done. Right. Well. When is the when is the the time frame because it's not due until October fifth. It looks here like it's not due until. November the fifth. November the fifth. Yeah, so you've got you've got time, and Brandy will be back on Monday. Okay. Okay, so I'll. If you want to call her back and get some specifics on it, I'm just reading off of her notes here. I understand, so I will. I got her name down, so I hit it policy. Normally, normally those normally those renewal numbers will not come out. It'll be at least thirty days before the policy renewed, so they probably haven't even sent the renewal out yet. No, they have not because I have not received it. But he just got the phone call and he was at work and he told me about it last night and he said give him a call to see what what's going on. So. We'll just tell him that's what it's all about. Is so the so the recalculate the rebuild cost on on everything or the replacement cost. Okay, that that's fine. So that increase in the. It'll increase the coverage. Yeah, name the right the that will be on the new bill that we get probably in October. Is that right? Yes, yes, ma'am. That's that's totally correct. And like I say now, Brandy will be back Monday. Okay. All right. You want to call back Monday and speak with her direct. That may be the best thing to do. That that sounds great. Just call her back at the I have the one code number, but I'm sure it goes to the alliance there. It's on. Sign it. Is that right? Or can then you have another number? I'm going to call her. Well, when you when you call that which number did you call the three seven seven number? No, the one on this statement is the one at code, but I can never get in the body at one code. Yeah, there's there
