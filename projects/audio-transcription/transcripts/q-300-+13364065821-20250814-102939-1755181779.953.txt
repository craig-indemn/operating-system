Thank you for holding. This is Jacy. How may I help you? Um, hey, I was calling to see if um about the renewal of my homeowner's policy. Um, I think it's, renewed in September. May I have your name, please? Cynthia Van Hoy. Thank you. And what's that address on there? Seven ninety four Falconbridge Road, Rollhall. Let me one second here. Okay. Now, was the address once one fifty? Torrey Lane. Yeah, that's um. My um physical address. Okay, I'm actually having trouble with this site. Um. Your home is currently insured with Utica. You said your address was what I'm sorry. Seven ninety four Falconbridge Road, Rollhall. And you were calling about the renewal. Yes. You have questions about the renewal. But I was wondering if it has come in because I've not gotten a price because a lot of times I don't get it until it happens and they've already like the price will be jacked up they've already drafted out the money that's not happening to me last year and it hit like um the year it was like quite a significant amount more and the year before that it had doubled and they're already like drafting out money out of my account that's not happening to me this year. That's what I'm determined on, especially being that my property taxes have already doubled. Um, because you know there's only so much somebody can take. Understand. Or, or sorry, haven't drafted out of your account before you even did a policy in the mail to review it. I understand. Yes, um. So you're looking for the renewal information. Right. I am going to get that information for you. Like I said, I'm having trouble logging into that site. So what I can do is I can email you over that um renewal document. Okay. To. I've got c c a u d l e ten at gmail dot com. Is that a good email address for you? Yes. Okay. All right. Let me get a hold of that and I'll um send it over. Um. Now you want to keep your physical address as a one one fifty. Is that correct or did you want to update it to the address that you have? Um insured. No, it's the one fifty. Okay. Me, me and my sister inherited this house from my mother. And my sister actually lived for my sister. So, but so I need those bills to continue to come to me because she'll just be really silly and she won't even give them to me. No problem. That's the reason why they need to come to me. Okay, that's not a problem at all. I just wanted to make sure we need we didn't need to make any updates. Oh no, it's way it should be. Okay, perfect. Just wanted to make sure, and I'll get those documents sent over to you. All right, thank you. You're welcome. Have a good one. Bye. Thank you. Bye.
