Sorry about the whole this is Gloria the lines are showing. Yeah hi Gloria this is Kenny calling from Travelers Office going this afternoon. Hi Kenny how are you doing today. Good good thanks for asking so, I wanted to give you a call regarding detailed dynamics. Llc and the information that you provided so, it sounds to me like the insured is operating more of like. A a handy person operation or a general contracting operation. So that that would fall outside of our appetite. Okay. So, typically if it was like something additional where the insured is doing pressure washing and then maybe something related to it or maybe something. Minor that's incidental the insured over operations we could potentially consider it but given that they're doing all this work. It would fall outside of our appetite so. I'm going to decline the request to add American Security Living Inc as an additional insured. And I'm also going to set this policy up for non renewal for next year. So it'll at least give the insured you know a little over a year to find a replacement coverage because we have reoffered the renewal policy to you. But at least wanted to just give you awareness of the action that we are looking to take and the chance to ask any questions or concerns that you may have. Okay perfect it's okay we just wanted to see if you guys are going to be able to at least take a look at it, since it's falling out of your appetite we fully understand. Okay perfect well then now what I'll do is this Gloria I'll send you an email after my phone call here with you, just recapping this conversation if anything else else arises from this request. Feel free to reach out to me okay. Alright thank you so much. Alright appreciate your time thank you. Alright bye bye. Bye.
