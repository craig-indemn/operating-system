Thank you so much for calling Auto Insurance. Yes, this is Navanda Harris and I was calling to pay my insurance. No problem. Let me get the information here for you one second. Your car insurance looks like it's an auto owner's policy. Yes. I'm pulling that up as you see. All right. Payment is one hundred and twenty six dollars and eighty one cents. Yes. I have a credit card ending in sixty nine eighty six. You want to use it? Yes. One second more and we're almost done. All right. The payment went through successfully. You will receive an email from Auto Owners letting you know that the payment is processed and will post it here in our system for you. Anything else I can help you with today? No, that's it. Enjoy your week. Thank you so much for calling us. Happy holiday. You too. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
