Thank you for holding this is Heather. Hi Heather this is Shivan returning your call. Oh hey girl how are you. I'm doing all right but yeah yeah the July twenty second yeah I would have had liberty mutual with us. Okay. So you didn't use that policy until the eleventh right. Yes yeah until and we had spoken that morning. Perfect. Okay yeah so that's when we wrote the policy that's what I was afraid of I was like oh no. Because we didn't have that policy the date that they're requiring this to be submitted. So Shivan Liberty Mutual has to be the one to fill that out. It has to be whoever was the the carrier at the time. That they're requesting and it was the twenty second I believe. Yeah you're right. Yeah. The July twenty second they they should have had that policy still active and until August eleventh. So. Right. And. So yeah exactly so yeah there's no reason why it shouldn't have been. So do you happen to have the an email address for the DMV. So I can do. See I don't see when we get these forms we just fill them out the carrier does and it lies. Oh I see. I'm seeing if there's something on that form that you submitted. Yeah because it has it has to be something I know like maybe I'm just trying to log in and. Cause it's just saying that I don't have anything so let's see. Yeah I'm looking too huh. What's an odd date for them to choose this is. Because I switched over. A car on the seventh of July. And then they're looking for something on the the twenty second of July. Yes oh the twenty second of July I was going to say on the twenty's. But yeah so their information is wrong. Actually what I can do and Heather not to waste your time I see there's a nine one. Nine one nine number on this. And I've got my certificate of insurance and that was Jesus. And seven four twenty five. With Liberty Mutual. And let's see. Insurance coverage acknowledgement. Yeah I mean I think it should be the certificate of mobile automobile insurance. Yeah it's called the plan up that you submitted and to us. Yeah so they're they're asking. For an F S one, effect is seven twenty two so what they're asking is they need proof. That you have insurance on this Toyota 2025 Toyota. On July twenty second. Yes. But they just haven't said since yeah. And it was through Liberty Mutual at that time. So they're the ones that have to do it we can't do it since we didn't have the insurance. Right. So I need to. Got to get a new Liberty Mutual. And I know I hate that but yeah you'll have to just get. Did you have an agent there with Liberty Mutual like someone you worked with. Yes I did. So yeah whoever the agent was I would just reach out to them just like you did with me just tell them hey you know you got this this letter from DMV. And it says that you didn't have coverage on July twenty second for the Toyota the 2025. And they'll just need to submit an F S one for July twenty second. Yeah yeah okay I can do that. I am sorry I thought it was one like usually we get these when we change insurance. And it's usually it would say August eleventh because it looks like you know when we changed you on August eleventh it looks like to DMV that Liberty Mutual canceled but we didn't start any policy which we did. And that's usually what happens but yeah this is a different date and the guy that was doing this. He picked it up and he was like Heather we didn't have her insurance July twenty second. I was like no no no we do and then I was like oh no wait DMV didn't start till August eleventh. Yeah all your policies that we have your home auto and umbrella they're all on the same date now it's August eleventh. Yeah with Cincinnati. So yeah that's all you need to do if you still had insurance with them July twenty second she can just your agent whoever it was with Liberty Mutual can submit that for you. Okay and it should clear it should clear up yeah and then if you get another one just let me know. Yeah you do. All right once they once they submit one for July twenty second then then they may come back and. Say that now they need one for August eleventh but this one's gonna have to clear first the oldest one the seven twenty two. Right yeah. Okay okay. Well but you know I'm just reading this it does say. On seven twenty two you certified the above vehicle was insured with the Cincinnati Group. They've got the wrong date they got the wrong information. They do yeah yeah you do at least they got our information though with Cincinnati you do have current coverage with them
