Thank you for holding. This is Holly. How can I help you? Hey, this is Jenny at Barclays Motors. One of your customers bought a car from me this past week, and I need to give you the information on him. Okay, sure. Do you have his policy number? I do. It is five four one four six seven nine nine zero zero. It's Terry Love. Thank you. And I didn't catch your name. Holly. Holly, okay. Looks like we've got something in here. Was it a 2011 Cadillac by chance? It is yes. All righty, looks like he has already got that done. Let me just get. Let's see. Van ends in one four zero six two. That's correct. All righty, beat you to it. Beat you to it. Do you need us to send you something over? No, that's all I needed. Thank you, Holly. You're welcome. Have a good day. You too. Bye bye.
