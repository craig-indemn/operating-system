Hi, this is Heather. Hey, Heather, this is Jennifer. I was returning your call, Jennifer Collins. I don't want you. I know you probably have already figured up numbers, and I'm sorry I'm just getting back with you. I just got off work. I work in Danbury, so it's like, yeah, I don't have service down there, and then by the time I get out, you're already gone home. By the time I leave. Okay, but we have all we ended up finding, and I don't, I don't, like I said, I'm sorry that you went through quotes and all that. We ended up finding somebody that got us like a really good rate, and I don't know if yours if yours was probably close to it. I don't even know how he got this good of a rate because I'm gonna tell you, saved us a thousand dollars a year. Who was it with? Who did they write you with? We ended up going with, and the only reason we went with him, we went with First Insurance Agency right there close to y'all. Used to be Terry Hawks. We went there. Filton Filton Hawks was our insurance agent at Farm Bureau. Back when he was at Farm Bureau, and we stopped in that same day that we stopped over there to talk to y'all. That was the last place that we had to go, and he's like, "Well, let me let me figure out these quotes," and I think he called my husband day before yesterday. And he ended up getting car like all liability for four vehicles. He ended up getting it for fifteen hundred. It's like fifteen fifty nine a year. I don't know how he did that, to be honest because out the have. Do you know? We were going to be like twelve sixty four starting in November. It's going to be twelve sixty four every six months. Do you know which carrier he wrote you with though? Yeah, it's Progressive. It is Progressive. Okay, all right. Okay, all right. But I'm sorry. Thanks for calling me. Oh, girl, no. Hey, let me know if that don't don't work out. You know we can revisit that. Okay. Absolutely, I appreciate it. I hope you have. Okay, you too, Jennifer. Thanks for calling me back, come. You're welcome. Bye bye.
