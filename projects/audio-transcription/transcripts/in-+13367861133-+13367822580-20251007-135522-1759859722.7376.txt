Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How may I help you? Somebody leave a message. Well, thanks for a couple hours ago about my insurance. I need a full quote on my insurance. By asking, asking for what kind of insurance I need. Okay. Had you called in for a quote? No, I used. I mean, somebody sent a message, but I need to talk to somebody in the office. We got a wrong wrong number. No, give me one second. I'll transfer you over. Okay. Thank you.
