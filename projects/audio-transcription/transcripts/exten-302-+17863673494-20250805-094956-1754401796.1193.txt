Thank you for holding, Missy Vana. How can help you? Hi, Anna. This is Rosalie Toro. I know that we added my husband's 2007 Freightliner. They now want to add a driver to that truck. Okay, give me one second. I'll get it. Hold on. Thank you. Thanks so much. Okay, and what is driver's first name? Michael, but it's spelled M as in mom, a y k e l. So m a y k l, sorry k e l k l e. No, no m a y. K e l. Okay. And. Um Vasquez via's in Victor. A z q u e z. Uh Vellis is a second last name because it's it's kind of it's two, via's in Victor E l i z. V e l i z. Uh huh. So Vasquez like my husband's last name, but then Vellis via's in Victor E l i z. Yeah. Okay. And date of birth. His date of birth is ten nineteen nineteen eighty five. Okay, and then driver's license number. Via's in Victor. Two two one. Five four zero. Eight five three seven nine zero. Is this um what state is this? This is Florida. Florida. Okay. Yeah. Do you know they have any accidents, clangor violations? No, half five years. No, no, none that I know of. No. Okay, um, so it looks like when I changed it to the Florida state, they're making the license number again. Can you repeat it? I'm sorry. Sure, of course. Via's in Victor. Two two one. Five four zero. Eight five. Three seven nine zero. Okay. Give me one second. Let me let the system process it. Sure, please. So it looks like there is a slight charge for the driver. Okay, what is it charge? It looks like the premium change for the remainder of the term is sixty nine dollars. Okay, that's fine. Yeah, and if you could and if you could send me you know how you had sent me the proof of coverage, could you send it to me again with his name on it? Like the COI, you only put name on the COI. Well, like that we have proof that he's a covered driver. What what could we provide to the the company for that? Okay. Um. Let me see. I don't know if they'll um. It might take about twenty four hours for them to generate that document. Oh, that's okay. That's okay. So he's covered. Send it over. Okay. Yeah, yeah, or if we maybe not on that, but if we could have maybe the the the the the insurance card or information that lists him as a driver, I think that would be fine. Okay. Yeah, once they generate that document, I can send that over. Just typically, unless they take that twenty four hours to generate it. Okay, but he's covered now. Correct. He is covered. Yes. Okay. Thank you so much. I really appreciate all your help, Anna. Yeah, you're welcome. Take care. Take care. Bye bye. Thank you too. Bye.
