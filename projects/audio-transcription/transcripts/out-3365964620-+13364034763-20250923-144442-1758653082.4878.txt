Hello, this Morgan. Hi Morgan, my name is Laken Benson. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. I usually deal with you when I need to change or talk about my health insurance, and I'm having another baby in a couple a couple months, and I was just trying to get some things in order with adding the new baby onto the policy and everything, and what I was looking like for as insurance wise with that. If that's something you're able to help me with. Yes, can I give you a call in the morning and we can walk through that? Yeah, can it be? Can it be? Can it either be tomorrow afternoon or Thursday morning because I work tomorrow morning. So whatever works. Far as however you say to chat. Yeah, it can be tomorrow afternoon. That works good. Okay, anytime after lunch, I'll have my cell phone on me. Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
