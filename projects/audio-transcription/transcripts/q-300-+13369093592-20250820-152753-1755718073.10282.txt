Over by the fuel pump. Thank you for holding, Miss Allison. Over down by me. Yes, ma'am. I'm calling on behalf of my insurance, my homeowners insurance. Okay, what's the name on the account? Robert Warren. And can you confirm your address on the account as well? Yeah, it's 380 Junction Road, Marshall, North Carolina 27028. Uh, David. Uh. Okay, and how can I help you? Uh, yes, ma'am. Um, I'm just calling to see why my insurance went up so much. Uh, between 2024 to 2025. Okay, let me get your account pulled up and auto owners give me just a second. I'm just comparing the 2024 policy to the 2025 policy to see the differences. It looks like the only thing that changed was the increase in your coverage a which is the coverage on your house if something would happen to it, and you know North Carolina did approve a statewide rate increase and a lot of people have seen huge increases in premium because of that. You don't have any claims on here, so yeah, it just looks like that rate increase. Is the reason. Adjust that that's the extreme amount nine hundred dollars. Yeah, so we can't change the amount of coverage on your home because that's an estimate of what auto auto owners thinks it would take to replace it if it were to burn to the ground or something terrible happened to it. But let's see what discounts you have. Bear with me one moment. Do you have any kind of alarm system at your house? What type of like? Any kind of cameras or a system like. What company is it with? Ring. Gotcha. Yeah, it looks like we have all the discounts that we can put on here. Um, so my only suggestion is because you renewed May 16th of this year. So your renewal for next year, we can shop you and we can look at placing you with a different carrier hoping to get that price down. Um, but you have all the possible discounts on here. There's only one discount. Yeah, I have a local. It's called local alarms discount. So because you have that ring on there, it's already been applied. Um. There's no other discounts you guys offer other than. That. No, if you had like a central alarm which would be like ADT or CPI, something that connects to like a police department, we can apply that discount on there. Um, or if you had your auto with auto owners, then that. So your auto is actually with National General. Um, but if it was with auto owners, which is the company that your home is with, then you would qualify for another discount. I thought that's what the agent did when I. So he helped me get my the guy that did with you guys alliance. Uh, it you guys did my home and auto bundle together. It is showing that you are written with National General for your auto and auto owners for your home, and my assumption is because the rate was probably better. National General is more competitive with auto rates and auto owners sometimes so. That's probably why they did that. But how much would the discount be? Um, let's see. Two hundred dollars. Oh, you. Yes. So. Yeah, for that increase, um, but we don't know what the rate would be for auto owners because like I said, National General is usually more competitive with auto. So I can't promise that your auto would be the same price as what it is with National General. It could be more. Oh, I see. The same. So I could pay more in the end. Yeah, so what I would do is let's wait until your home renewal next May May 16th about a month out. I'll reshop you because we work with over 20 different carriers and I'll look and see if we can get you a better rate for the home. Okay, thank you. That that means and you'll you'll be the one to reach out. Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and set a task for me right now for next year. Um, like I said, about a month before your home renewal, and I'll shop you and figure out where else we can put you. Okay, thank you so much. And what was your name? Addison. Okay, thank you, Addison. You're welcome. Have a good day.
