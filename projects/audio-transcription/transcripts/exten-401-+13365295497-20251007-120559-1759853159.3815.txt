We're holding with Heather. Hi Heather, hey this is Elizabeth Portino. I haven't called you back for forever. Hey girl. Hey, how are you? I'm doing good. How you are? I am. Okay, so when you sent me that email and I meant to call you before now and I didn't write it down, something didn't happen. I could not it would not let me it could not pull up. All my information. Okay, you're talking about the link I sent to submit your. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, I I used that link so you could get all my information to kind of compare you know all my details of my house or whatever. So what do I do now? So do I need to resend it or it just didn't it didn't work for you or what? Yeah, it just wouldn't work. It just it just wouldn't. I mean. So okay, let's say this it did work. I was able to click on it. It it would not retrieve my information. Let's put it like that. Huh? Who are you? How is your policy free? Are you a foreigner? Who who insures your policy? I wonder if it's all state. Doesn't have anything to do with. I'm doing it on my telephone. Because I I know some of that stuff is my computer's not working so. Yeah it shouldn't yeah you should be able to. So all of them are through all state. Yes, they're all with all. I'm all all my stuff is all state. Okay. So did you select all state as your carrier? I did. Okay, and then did it direct you to your policies after that? It should have. No, it should ask you. I can't remember what happened. It did not. Okay. Hook me to. I think what happened was it didn't get my pull my information up. Right, so yeah you'll have to either create a login if you can't remember. Your username and password, it's going to ask you for your credentials. Ask you select all state. Yeah, I did I did all that I did all that and I have I have an idea. Yeah, maybe I need to call all state and see if it's just not hooked up somehow to my. My sign in. I don't want to sign in. I just have nothing. Gotcha. Yeah, that's interesting. I've never had that happen before. Oh, of course it could happen to me because when you. Do you have a copy of all your policies? Um, I think I have it all in emails because they don't send paper anymore. Well, if if it's easier, I don't want you to have to call them and go through all these hoops and stuff just to do that. If you have them in an email, just forward them to me. That way, that'll be fun. Yeah, let me let me do that. Let me try something because I really I've been trying to do this. It feels like for two years or something. Well, because I remember I was dealing with that other house and you were dealing with that. And I got that all done and out of the way and I was like, all right, I'm going to move on to my stuff and it just hasn't happened yet. That's all right, girl. We'll get you fixed up eventually. All right, let me try that. Um. So is your email EJ? Is your email EJ140WSAOL is that correct? Yes, it is. It is. Why don't you try sending me that? Let me try that one more. Yeah, I'm just going to resend the link and like I said it'll ask for your carrier select from the drop down and select all state. Um and then it'll ask for credentials here login and if you if you don't know them or forgot you can always. Um, I think there's an option to to create a new one or something like that. So yeah, I mean I didn't have any trouble navigating it. It just wasn't doing it. Yeah, so. And then if you get through to the end, you can select all your policies and then it at the end it's kind of weird because some people are like, well. It's not let me submit. It's redirected me to YouTube. If you get to YouTube, the commercial on YouTube and it's done. Okay, okay. It doesn't say anything like congratulations you submitted it successfully or any. It just like redirects you to a YouTube station or YouTube station, sir. Go figure. But yeah, a lot of people get confused whenever it's that because it looks like it would say congratulations submission successful or something. But I don't think it's I think it just automatically shoots you over to YouTube. So if you get there, I've got it.
