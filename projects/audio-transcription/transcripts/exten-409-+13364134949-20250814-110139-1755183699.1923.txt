It's Corbin, may I help you? Hey Corbin, this is Mike Bailey. How are you? What's up, Mike Bailey? Hey, so you got him in it. Yeah, yeah, it sure did. So I've got a customer that I was wondering if you could work up a quote for. They went with Travelers and I think it's a good quote, but the the total payment is coming in higher than what they. Had had hoped because taxes have gone up. They were trying to see if we can cut their payment any way that we can, or else they might walk away. From this deal, I've got Travelers. Yeah, I've got Travelers binder that I could send to you. Yeah, yeah. Could you look at it and see if you can cut this any? Yeah, can I get a? I want a date of birth as well. Second. Okay. Yeah, I can put that on the email or I'll tell you now. Go ahead. I'm I'm writing it now. Okay, first of all, their name is it's a female Tony T O N I. Brown and his name is William Brown. And I'm getting to the screen that will give me their date of birth. And we had a bunch of people this morning. Sure did. I know we went over. I figured that was going to happen. Well, Corbin, my computer's frozen. Fuzzy nap. Okay. You know the address by chance or is that on different? Yeah. On my computer. I do. It's uh the number five. It says five. Marvin Boulevard. And Winston Salem two seven one zero five. All right, I my computer lost connection on that. We were having computer problems or connection problems. There, so just just kick me off. Building seventy two. One story brick. Any idea what the age of roof is on that? I don't. I know that's important now. Appraisals usually don't don't say. I mean, I can I can send you the appraisal. You can maybe look at the pictures to get an idea of how it looks. Let me get back in this file. Okay. So seventy two building seventy two. I mean, if you want, I can quote it for you real quick. Okay. All right. I got. Yeah, let me get their date of birth. For you opening the file back up and to log back in. Okay. Let's see. Okay, her date of birth is six thirteen of two thousand. And his date of birth is three six of twenty two thousand and two. Credit pretty good though. Let's see. Actually, one of Matthew's customers. I'm not familiar with him. The credit scores on the mortgage report are. And we do all three. It looks like she is in the. They're both in the mid to upper six hundreds on the mortgage report. As far as the the credit itself, let me scroll down. I don't see. I don't see any late payments at all. Two seven one zero five. Um. Okay, I can get the phone number email there. Let's me continue. I'm just going to put the phone number in there three five four four thousand. Or email. And I'm going to send you. Let's see. I'm sending your Travelers binder right now. All right. Like they haven't covered it for two forty four thousand purchase price is less, but I know that often has nothing to do with how much coverage they need. Yeah, exactly. Marvin. Boulevard. All right, let's see. Standard homeowners. Oh. They're eligible for. Eligible. That's good. That's a good start. Good start. And then. Okay. They like quoted eleven fifty eight a year. Yep. And what do you need it at? This is though we can get it. I mean, you know, their payment was going to be just barely over fourteen hundred, and then taxes went up about fifty three, and then they changed some stuff on the contract. So I'm trying to get them back into. Below fourteen hundred. Anyway, I mean, just I don't know how much you can cut it. If you get it down to like nine hundred, I know that maybe you change the. The deductible or something. Sure. All history. They're clean. I'm not sure for what they're thinking. I still need to run an analysis, but I can. They're at two forty. Two forty four. And then they gave them a thousand medpay. I don't even think they got replacement cost on this. If you look at the endorsements, they don't have homeowner replacement cost. Wow. Oh. They got it and that's a twenty five hundred dollar deductible. So even that. Travelers policy is terrible because you got to have dwelling replacement on there. They got personal property replacement on their own dwelling. Even
