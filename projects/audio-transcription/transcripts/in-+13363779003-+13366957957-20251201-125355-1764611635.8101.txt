Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, hi. Is Corbin available? Looks like Corbin. I've left a couple messages. Would you like his voice mail? No, can you? I've left a couple messages already. Can you check my account for me? I actually got a ticket. I'm not sure. I thought I'd try to get Corbin. It says my insurance is set up on automatic draft. Okay, what name is the policy in? Jermaine Lane. Okay. Take me just a second to get it logged in for you. Okay, I might ask another thing too if you could do something for me. Yes, it looks like it is on auto pay. It looks like the payment's going to draft today. Okay, okay. Let me. We can't stop that because my social security is not in there. Getting on the third. No, that I'd have to get you over to an agent for. So give me one moment and I'll see if I have an agent that can help. Okay, all right.
