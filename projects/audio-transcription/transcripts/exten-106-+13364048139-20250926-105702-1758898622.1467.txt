This is Jessica. I can help you. Hey Jessica, this is Melba. Um, I think maybe you were trying to call me. Yes, I was giving you a call regarding the River Creek. The policies are still under pending cancellation. Uh, for non payment and then the umbrella we had sent over a form for you to sign to get it reinstated. It looks like you opened it, but it was never signed. So I wasn't sure what you were trying to do there. Uh, I'm not sure either. Um. So I mean, at this point. At this point, like I'm pretty much. Like done with with River Creek, and so I saw I was I don't know what do you. So your um. Your job that I think you were working on one. That one's already done. Is that what you're going to? Okay. Well then, if you don't have any other projects, I I wouldn't see why you would keep the policies open. Buying a tell insurance policy like you did for Megami be good in case anyone comes back. Mandatory, but we recommended a previous. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So we recommended for River Creek, but in that case, then no, it doesn't make sense for you to pay. Um, the nine thousand and whatever to reinstate the umbrella as well. For a company that you're not going to be. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Here's my question. Um. Can you run over me? Run real quickly. What is a a ghost policy? The ghost workers' comp policy. Yeah, it's the policy that. You don't have any true payroll for employees, so you carry that to be able to show it to whatever contract. Or you're working with so they. Okay. Give you the job, but you don't have any. It's just basically. But you don't have any coverage. Okay. Because no coverage for the owner. Okay, because um currently I'm still owed a little bit of money through some of the companies, but I have. It's just me on payroll and um I technically I'm not doing anything and so I don't want them to start. Back charging me that for not having that insurance, but I don't want to be paying the insurance because I also don't need it. I don't know. Gotcha. Um, I could yeah because you know that makes sense. Unfortunately, we don't write ghost policies anymore, so I also wouldn't. Oh, you don't okay. Yeah, no. Gotcha. Okay. So yeah, okay. Okay, so I'll put a note here. Then the policies will go to cancel for non payment. They'll of course still reach out to do an audit for the time that you have the policy. I can. Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Do um can you cancel it? Does it like. Make a difference if it's non payment as opposed to canceling it. Um, I mean, if you cancel it now, actually, no, it's about the same because when you do the audit. Um, it'll go back like you won't show payroll as of whatever was the last date. Okay. Cancel that you. Made payroll, I guess for that company. So it's not like you would be overpaying because they're only going to charge you all for the revenue, of course, that the business made for the period that they audit and then they'll charge you for the payroll. Okay. Um, I would just let it cancel for non payment. Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much, Jessica, for giving me a hint with this. Okay, no worries. Have a great day. You do the same. Thank you. Bye bye.
