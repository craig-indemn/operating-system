Think for all day it's scary. Gary, this is Charlie Moore. I wanted to know, did you get my email? I did on the roof staff, Mr. Moore. Yeah, so I went ahead and said. Yeah, I got it this morning and I sent it on to the company. Okay, all right. Okay. Okay, I just want to make sure. Yeah, we got it. Okay, will the insurance company get in touch with me or how would they work? Well, they'll probably contact me if they need anything else, and if they do, then I'll call you. Okay, thank you, Gary. Appreciate your help. You're welcome. You're welcome. Bye bye. Have a good day. You too.
