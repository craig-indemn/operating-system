Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hi, Dana. How are you today? I'm good, Wakina. How are you doing? I'm doing pretty good. I wanted to call and make my mom's payment. For her homeowner's insurance. Sure, absolutely. Let me be logged in there. Okay, yeah, I tried to call. Before, but for I guess with the holidays, I missed you all. Or you must have closed early or something. Yeah, on Fridays we are closing early now at three thirty. Okay. And that that's probably when you called. Okay, all right. So I need to call before three thirty every Friday. Yeah, yeah, going forward, we just started that this month, so it's kind of new to us too. Okay, sounds good. I wish I would have known. I didn't know. Did you have good Christmas? Yes, I did. I did. It was it was very relaxing. I didn't do anything. I just was able to chill out and just relax. Good. Sometimes you just need that. And I needed it. Yeah. Excuse me, Dana. I can't even remember which account I used to make the last payment. For my mom's account, I'm hoping it was my Wells Fargo. Because I know I, I know I did it with a checking account. Yeah, I was gonna say I think it was a checking account. And are you gonna do you want to do it with a checking account again? Yes, ma'am. Okay. So it would be one twenty. One twenty. No, I'm sorry. One sixty eight twenty five. You show is one sixty eight. I thought it was two sixty eight. I mean it is. I'm sorry. It's two sixty eight and twenty five cents. Right. Okay, that sounds right. I take a migraine pill. Just. Need some help. No, you're fine. You're fine. I just I said I said. I was hoping it could be that amount, but I said I'm thinking Dana is two. I know you're right. You're absolutely right. Twenty five. And I would I would love for it to be one. Eight twenty five. I would love for it to be that amount. Maybe you're talking something into existence for me. Yeah, I hope I am. Maybe next year. Yes, maybe next year. Yeah, okay. So I'm ready for the routing number. Okay, the routing number is going to be. I'm thinking this one. What what what what account did I pay with it last time? Was it the Wells Fargo? I don't know if it's showing me. Let me see if I can pull up a receipt. I think the routing number is that O five three. Zero zero zero two one nine. Now the routing number I could look that up for you to find if that's the question the routing number. Yeah. I was I'm looking at the old receipt. It it doesn't tell me. It doesn't give me any kind of information on the routing number. Yeah. Does it have an account number for it? No, it just gives me like a confirmation number. Policy number. Date. Well, it says payment account type and then it says Excel seven zero three four. Does that mean anything? So okay, I thought maybe that could possibly be the ending of the account number seven zero three four, but it says Excel, so I don't know what that means. Okay, well let me give you so it doesn't have uh it doesn't have the. Let me give you my the routing number for this one. I believe is O five three. Zero zero zero two one nine. Okay. So it does. What comes up for that routing number? Uh okay, let me search it. Let's see. Or do you need the account number also? Well, I was just gonna Google it to see. Sometimes if you put um. It will say what the what bank is with that routing number. Okay. Sounds good. All right, sounds good. Thank you. It's okay. So when I when I Google that routing number, it says Wells Fargo. Sounds good, and then the account number. Are you ready for that one? Yes, ma'am. Two three eight zero nine seven two four seven seven. Okay, and give that to me one more time. Two three eight zero nine seven two four seven seven. All right, and you want to pay two hundred and sixty eight dollars and twenty five cents, right? Yes. Okay. Okay, Wakina, do you want me to send you a copy of that receipt? Yes, please. All right, I'll get that sent right over. Is that all you needed? Yep, that was it. I think everything else should be in order. Um, you don't have anything showing for me or Cortez that need to be paid. Are you? Um,
