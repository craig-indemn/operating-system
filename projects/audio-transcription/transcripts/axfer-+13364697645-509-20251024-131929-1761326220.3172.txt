I'm at one fifty one, Azalea Lane, repair insurance through our mortgage, the Carington. But my name is Linda, and also is probably under Linda or Francis Ashford. The address is one five one, Azalea Lane in Wuxford, North Carolina. Just had some questions regarding this escrow that went up. What all the details was for because our mortgage went from like nine something to twelve something. So just trying to figure out what's going on with everything. Just now got the information on it. Um, evidently, not sure if they didn't send out. If they sent a letter, we didn't read it. But I went through the mortgage account and saw the letter that was sent back. It's evidently August. I just saw today, saying it won't take effect this month. So if he could just give me a call back. My name again is Linda Ashford. My phone number is three three six four six nine seven six four five. Again, that is three three six, four six nine seven six four five. If you don't mind, it would be great if you can give me a call back after four o'clock. That way I can have a husband around me and we can go here at the same time. That would be great. Thank you.
