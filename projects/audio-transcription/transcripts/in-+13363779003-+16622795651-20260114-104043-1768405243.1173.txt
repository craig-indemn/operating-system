Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hello, ma'am. Um, I called yesterday to see they can send me an ID identification for his for my husband's insurance. And they're supposed to send it by email, and I haven't received that copy. Okay, what name was the insurance in? Parsa Samuel S. Parsa. Let's look and see here. Okay, it looks here. Insurance call requested. Okay, I think I can see where you called in and I can see where they were trying to help. But it looks like you need to speak to Cody about these policies. Okay. Let me let me get you over to him just one moment. Thank you. You're welcome.
