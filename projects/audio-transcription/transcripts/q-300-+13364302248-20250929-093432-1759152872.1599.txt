Good morning. Thank you, Golden Alliance Insurance. This is Jena. Hey Jena, um, this is Angela Dale G A Y L E Williams. And I have a um auto policy with you. I sold my car over the weekend. Okay. I will be getting another one, so I don't want there to be any. I ran into this before when I sold my car, and my mother-in-law kind of gave me hers. Um. Anyway, long story short, I dropped my coverage on on my vehicle and they penalized me with a. Um. I guess I don't. I don't know what what I got penalized with, but anyway, um, I don't want to like not have coverage because I'm going to get coverage, but I just want to discontinue it on the car that I just sold. Okay. I don't know how that works in your world. All right, give me one second here. Sure. I just went back too far. Okay, here we go. Are you in the Winston Salem office? Hi Clemens. Clemens. Okay. Yeah. Okay, let's see. Well, best computer I've worked this morning. It's Monday. Okay, on that Audi. Yes. Okay. If you want to keep that insurance going, you're going what you're going to do? Just switch the tag that you got right now to the new car that you're going to be getting. I I don't know I I guess so. Um I haven't found what I wanted yet, but I do have the tag from the one that I sold. Okay. Yeah, if you if you want to keep that active, I'll just leave it as it is, and then once you're ready to switch vehicles, we can just switch them out, and you can just take the tag and transfer it to the new vehicle. Okay. So if if nothing happened, so if anything were to happen, I wouldn't be responsible for the Audi any longer, right? Right. Okay. All right. I just want to make sure that happens because I sold it to a a young girl and she's kind of an inexperienced driver. She's like 17 or something. So I just want to make sure I'm not. Responsible. Okay. And you had the tags. I mean, the title, notarized out of your name. I did. Yeah. Yeah, you you'll be fine. Okay. All right. Perfect. Well, thank you, and I'll give you a call back once I locate my vehicle and go ahead and give you all that information. Okay. Okay. Not a problem. Sounds good. And. Thank you. Have a good day. You too. Bye bye. Bye.
