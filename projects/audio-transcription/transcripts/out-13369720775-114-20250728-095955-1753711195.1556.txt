Hi, good morning. This message is for Virginia. My name is JC and I'm calling with Alliance Insurance regarding the signed application we need to file. For National General, we are also needing proof of insurance for another driver. If you wouldn't mind just giving me a call back so we can get this figured out with National General. Currently, they have removed that full coverage from your policy because they are missing the signature and then as well as proof of insurance. Again, you can give me a call back at three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thank you.
