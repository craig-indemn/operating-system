Hello, this Jeff Edmonds, can I help you? Jeff, this is Bill Meyer. I don't know if we've talked much or not, but you might be looped into this long story. Things work out for the best, but I'm not working for Excel Construction anymore and insurance situation. Yeah, we're trying to get what. And I know I know Sean might have reached out to you guys. See, we're trying to get a final number would be refunded back to me so. He could cut me his the check based on the refund is out back to me. I think I responded back to him that we will not be able to know what that figure is until the policy cancellations are processed. We don't have way in our office to calculate that. So once those cancellations, hopefully within a few days business days, are processed, then we will know what those refunds will be for both of the policies. Okay. Yeah. So you think we don't have way to calculate that in house. No, that's fine. So you your general thinking is by the middle of next week. Hopefully again, where we got a weekend here typically. I mean we. We submit both of those cancellations requests directly to the companies, which makes it quicker than it could be otherwise. So the hope is end of next week, if not before, will those cancellations will be processed. And we'll know what that credit will end up being on both policies. Okay. Then once that is done, how how would since the this done kind of weird but whatever. So the policies are in my name, obviously, with my company name. What is what is the time frame? For the refund typically take. Depends on the company. I mean, they're they're checks that are mailed out. They won't be direct deposited back or anything like that. So just ever how long it takes. That process to happen, so you know how mail runs. It seems to be slower the last few years than it used to be. So you know I I would expect. Typically a week or two after that, once it's processed, but again, I'm kind of speaking out of my league there. It depends on individual company there. I'm not going to hold you accountable. I'm just trying to get some some ideas. So. All right, all right, thank you, sir. Anything you can do to expedite it would be greatly appreciated, but I appreciate your help. You're welcome. Thank you very much. Bye bye bye bye bye.
