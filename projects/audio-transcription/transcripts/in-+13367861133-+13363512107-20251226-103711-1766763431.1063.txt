Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number. I was trying to get in touch with Rachel Hall. Does she work there? She does. Yep, absolutely. Um, let me try to transfer you over to her extension. I'm not sure if she's working today or not. Okay. Um, then I can definitely transfer you over. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Um, if you don't reach her, you can always call me back. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Um, let me get. I'm looking up her extension here. Okay, seven and two. All right, hold on just a moment. Okay.
