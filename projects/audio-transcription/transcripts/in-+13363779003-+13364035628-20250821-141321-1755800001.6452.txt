Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Well, good afternoon, honey. This is Robin Pettit. How are you? I'm doing good. And you? I'm good. Who do I need to speak to? Because I called like five times to get someone to help me get some liability insurance on our business. Okay. Is um do you already have insurance with us now or before? I have had it before. Okay. It's under I would think Robin Pettit years ago, and I've got to get some liability policy on Island Breeze and King. Okay. Well, let me see if I have an agent available. Let me. Of course not. They've never called me back. They never. I mean, I wish I could find my notes on how many people I've asked and nobody called me back. Okay. Let let let me try another way to get an agent for you. Just one moment. All right. Thank you, honey. You're welcome. And if I can't get someone, I will come back. One moment. You're welcome. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance Services.
