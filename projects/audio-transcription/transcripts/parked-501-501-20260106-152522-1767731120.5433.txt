It's a great after middle alliance insurance. This is Jamie. Hi Jamie, this is Jocelyn Harris. I'm I'm calling about that payment I have to make. I didn't get that discount told me about. It's saying that it's it's 220 discount, but it's the same thing that I paid last year. Let me review it for you because I know that they that they did give you a discount when we removed the mortgage. But the rates, maybe let me pull up here. I'm sorry, let me look. Okay, just make sure I look at good info. One seven three hunters way in Andrew, North Carolina. That's that you wrote, Jocelyn. Okay, okay, so. Let me see here. Check, I know it pulled money off of the old policy. I want to make sure that it is not on the. For some reason it didn't. Bear with me one moment. I'm I'm gonna do this here for you. It says on the app that it supplied, but I can see it supplied and I'm paying the same thing again. Okay, I see it. Okay, so here's what happened on December 12th. I removed mortgage information off your homeowners policy. That pulled 16. 7 cents off this existing term today. It pulled 542 dollars off of this upcoming renewal term. Okay, which your homeowners policy is slated for renewal on January 11. So it did pull money off of that term. However, the crummy part about this is that on July 1st of 2025, the North Carolina Department of Insurance bumped up the base rate for all auto and all homeowners policies by seven and a half percent. So in the guts of this policy, there was a rate change by the state, and that has affected money on this policy. It's not just your policy, Miss Harris. It is literally everybody in the state, myself included. Got a bump in the rate back on July 1st. The other thing that happened is the coverage on your home is increasing. On this upcoming renewal, it's currently 222, 500 dollars. On this upcoming renewal on January 11th, the replacement cost on your home is slated to be 248, 500 dollars. So that increase in coverage is also affecting this money. They are giving you a paid-in-full discount of 222 dollars. Yeah. But shake it all out, wash it all through. It boils down to 1, 478 even. Is the renewal premium on your homeowners policy? Miss Harris, I I'm gonna say this because I'm frustrated about my own insurance, my own homeowners insurance. I don't honestly have any idea when any of this is going to settle. I am a little. I do think the auto product that would sell is going to get a little easier as time goes on. Hopefully, homeowners insurance scares me. There's no data out there anywhere that has any kind of warm and fuzzy feeling to it between the inflation that is going on in the world, steel and bad weather here in North Carolina. The homeowners product is probably slated to continue to increase through 2026 and 2027, possibly 2028 and beyond. I think before it's all said and done, the homeowners insurance is going to get it's going to get very expensive for people. As as the world changes around us, I don't have any other way to pull coverage away from your policy. I can certainly explore. Let me let me just do this with you on the phone here. Let me see January 11th is your renewal date. I can possibly look at maybe deductible changes for you and see if that see what that would do to the policy. Bear with me one moment. Let me see what we're working with. Okay, so you have a 1000 deductible currently. And don't let me talk into this if you are not comfortable with it. But in the event that you wanted to bump that to 2500 dollars, it would pull 222 dollars off of this upcoming renewal premium. It would drop the price down to 1256 dollars. And you could go up from there. Auto owners would let you carry a 5000 deductible as well if you wanted to. You say 2500. You currently have a you currently have a 1000 deductible. If you went to 2500 dollars, it would pull 222 dollars off the annual premium. 2500 dollars, 2500 dollars. That would be the beginning of the next year. January 11th is when I set that date for yes man. Miss Harris, if you want to think this, you don't have to answer me right now
