Thank you for calling, Vicky Pickard. This call is being recorded. Please hold while I try to connect you. You can see Carports is speaking. Him may help you. Hey Vicky, it's Cody. How are you? Good, how are you? I am doing all right. I just got your email about this builder's risk policy. Is this for building the NC Carports is doing and the builder? No, Schumacher home is building Dema house. Okay, so y'all are putting up a building on this new construction property. I have no idea. All they wanted was seventy five thousand dollars theft, and the house is valued at seven hundred something thousand dollars. Right, so y'all are putting up a building on this property. I would assume. I mean, I don't know. No, it's it's going to be a home for Abel and his wife. Giovanni bought like one hundred and ten acres. Okay. And they're all going to be building houses. Well, two of them, the other one somewhere else already built a house. Well, Schumacher built it. Okay. So the builder's risk policy, Abel is Giovanni's dad. Is that right? Yep, that's right. Okay. Um. So Schumacher is asking for a builder's risk. Yeah, that's the part I copied and pasted. The other thing they had attached, I didn't know if you'd need it or not. Right. So cover it's not needed. Cover the build cost and have seventy five thousand in theft coverage. Yeah, the build cost is seven hundred sixty-two three seventy-one. Yeah. Okay. So it's just okay. I just I was a little confused because I was like, well, are they putting up a building or what? What's going on? Because it says seventy five theft. So I was just trying to figure out if this is for the house or for a building on the going on the same property. No, that's a for a house. For the actual house. Okay. Yeah, Giovanni and them will be building a house too sometime. Okay, so Giovanni owns property now. Abel's building a house there. Yeah, he's going to build a house there. Yeah. Gotcha. It was one hundred and ten acres. One hundred and ten acres. That's a nice plot. Yeah. Um. Let me. Don't have any neighbors that way, but. No, you are not going to have any neighbors on that. That's for sure. Um. Let me see what all we will need to get this going, and then I will let you know. All right, darling. Thank you. How soon is he needing this? How fast? Yeah, I. He needing the builder's risk. Well, it looked like to me till the escrow thing is straightened out or something. I don't. What was it? It said, "Was it escrow?" If this policy will need to be effective as of the day the escrow is funded. Okay, so. I don't know when that is. Maybe you can find that. I don't either. I'll try to find out. Yeah, see what you can find out on that, and we'll see what we need to get information wise. The policy, the house is going to be. It looks like in Abel's name, not Giovanni's. So. The policy will go in Abel's name as well. One sixty three Salemwood was his previous address or current address. It should be one sixty three Salemwood Trail. They live right beside Giovanni. Gotcha. One sixty seven Salemwood Trail. Gotcha, and they're going to keep that dream going. It seems like. Yeah, sir, sounds like it. All right. Let me let me see what we'll need and just let me know. Did you see what Schumacher wrote? What go to Farm Bureau. Oh yeah. I want to write them back and tell them I wouldn't insure my dog with Farm Bureau unless it's a builder's risk. I wouldn't either. That's funny. All right, I will. Um, I'll see what information we need to get together and it looks like it's just going to be in Abel's name only
