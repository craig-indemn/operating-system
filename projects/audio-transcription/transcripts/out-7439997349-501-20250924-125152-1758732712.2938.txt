I think you've already spoken with him today, but I spoke with Mr. Cheek yesterday afternoon. He had literally just had the accident that stood said in the car, and he was in a bit of shock and panic yesterday. I literally just got up the phone with him. He does not feel well today and he needs to he did voice that he's got to go get checked out. He thinks he might have a concussion and some other stuff going on there. But unfortunately, his Prius was the only vehicle he has access to, and he said that he does not have any friends he could lean on for a ride. So he does need a rental car set up ASAP. If you could please give him a call at your earliest. It would be very much appreciated. Three three six two five three five three one five is John's cell phone number.

Thanks so much.
