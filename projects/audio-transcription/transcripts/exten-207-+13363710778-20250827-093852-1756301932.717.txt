Sorry, hold. Does this buddy help you? Yes, this is Oscar. Hey Oscar, how are you, sir? Good. How are you? I'm doing well. I'll help you. Well, I'm just calling to see. We've got now the interns. I'm still waiting. I submitted the quotes. I'm still waiting on to get the quotes back approved. I'm hoping to have those back today. Oh, you're still waiting. Yeah, it takes it's a process. You have to wait for the underwriter to get to them and get the quotes approved and everything. I emailed her and asked her to try to get those to me by today so we could get them issued for you. Okay. It takes a little bit of time because it's not something I just put in the system and then I can just give to you instantly. I have to wait for somebody to actually go in and approve the quotes and review it and everything like that. Yeah. So it takes a little bit of time, but hopefully I'll have it before the end of the day and we can get them issued for you and I can get a certificate over. So you're planning to load on Monday, right? Ah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, I hope to have it done by today or tomorrow morning at the absolute latest for you, Oscar. Okay. I will give you a call as soon as I get them back though. Okay, and I'll email them over to you and we can go over. All right. All right. All right. Thank you. Thank you, sir.
