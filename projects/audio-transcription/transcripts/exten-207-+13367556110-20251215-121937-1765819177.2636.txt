Sorry for a hold. This is Cody. May help you. Hey Cody, this is German. Friends to be honest, how are you? Good German. How are you, sir? Good, good. Hey, I got a quick question for you, Cody. And I wanted to know like. What do you think? Well, man, what's the best option to you know we bought a new like vehicle like SUV under the company name which is nothing for like for installation or anything like that right? Is that is that possible to be on a different policy for y'all? Like no be no be mixed it or be in the same policy whether I got other trucks for work. I don't know how it works. What? It's just an SUV. An SUV. Who is it for? It's it's we bought it under NC Steel buildings. I know you bought it under NC Steel buildings, but like who drives it and what is it used for? Oh, not like like me and my wife. It's just like a personal vehicle for y'all. Well, kind of like it is. For yeah. For personal. For the business, are you running the job sites? Are you doing other running errands for the business? Doing things with it. Yes. Yes, basically. Yep. So we, let me see one second. So we can add that to. Your policy, your commercial policy. I mean, it's it's was bought by NC Steel, so it needs to go on your commercial auto policy with them, and we can add it. Should be able to just add it as a personal auto instead of a. What are you using it for exactly? You are using for business and for personal. That's correct. Okay. Usually we can just add those to the commercial policy as a. Private passenger vehicle usually and. That's the way that you would need to go about that since you bought an NC Steel's name. Okay, because that's not that's not other way that I cannot be like in commercial policy. Well, when you buy something in a company name, it has to go on the company commercial auto policy. It can't just go on a personal auto policy anymore. Okay, so okay, because that's that's like, but what about if you have another type of policy like I mean we open another policy like totally new you know the thing it is is because you know like mostly those trucks you know man they're like they're different I get it I mean if they ended up getting like let's say accident or something I understand it's an commercial policy but this one is just going to be a little bit different so I mean that was yeah you still have to insure it through the commercial policy though. Okay, it's just because it's in a business name. Because it's in the business name, yes sir. Got it. Alright. You want to email me the the year, make, model, VIN number. And it's just going to be you and your wife. Is your wife a driver on the policy? I think she is. Yeah, I can I can do it, Cody. And I mean, if y'all give me estimated for them, I talked to another insurance like because I was trying to make it a separate basically we don't want to like be in the same policy. But this this agent has been that's what our personal uh vehicles with it they will take a little bit longer that will. That we, I guess I was not expecting it's going to take three days or so to give me some numbers. It still don't have no insurance on it. So well I say I need to go somewhere else. But that's what I am going because I want to know like if it's what would be the numbers for it. That's why. What would be the numbers for it? Yeah, basically like what would be the. Yeah, yeah, how much it would cost? You know that's why I am trying to compare it with. I am not sure exactly what made you buy it in the company. So what are you going to be doing with it for the company? Well, we're going to we're going to use it for you know I have to I have to um go basically sometimes I am not saying the full like one hundred percent is going to be like. Basically, all those dealers and everything, but I ended up like get it because I mean I don't I've been used another small um truck that I have it like personal personal to go basically to some of our dealers. It's just in a different place, like South Carolina, like Tennessee, and some of those. I say, well, man, this year I say, why not get it in? I get a two trucks this year, right? Which is doesn't want to add it to the policy. What is for a mature right here, local and one ass for those crews. So. Um, this one I She was going to get. No, she was going to straight with on the fifty-two. Okay. Top light and she said she got a green light so she was driving normal with a woman hitting well fifty-two south I think because it was going towards Monarre so she said they got a green light and another car that was trying to turn I guess left. And. She didn't have the green light. She have the she says she have the green light. What did the police report say? Well, the police report say everybody like well basically ours or insurance is going to take care of our vehicle like which our truck and the other guy that was they supposed to take their insurance which like there was nothing like I guess the way how to put it in the report that was nobody's fault. Basically. Yes. Okay. Kind of like that's what it was, but. What are you in court for? They now they're trying to get you to pay for their stuff or something. That's correct. Okay. And I guess they tried to have a court in June of this year in the quarter that was this miss. I don't know. What was the I don't know exactly what was the reason for it, but they reopened the case again and we just get a letter for the charity bring us a letter probably like a month ago. But we we talked to a lawyer and everything we never hit anything, what was going to be the next. I see, but y'all are in court now because they're just trying to get more money from you guys instead of them. Well, basically, basically it was way way way less right now. Basically, what? There was less money. That was that was requested for. Okay. That was way way way less. If I am not mistaken, the first time that was requested a very very high amount of money, which is I guess for the insurance and all stuff. This time, well the first time that was the miss the court. This time they just come with the way way way way low numbers on it. I got so. Well, I will I reach out to the underwriter and see what she says. Hopefully we can keep. See because now we have the installation and the manufacturing on your general liability now and your workers' comp. Obviously your workers' comp is separate from from this situation but. We just need to find out if if Westfield is going to let us keep all that stuff with them and just move the auto or if they're just going to not renew the whole thing. I hope that I can convince them to keep the rest of it and just drop the auto line from that package. So that would be the best situation and then we just have to look for the auto cover somewhere else. Okay. I mean I will say. Let me get over to. I want to look at your policy here. Let's see if this shows me everything. That doesn't show me. All right, so your auto. If I can get to it, here we go. All right, so right now, well, this may be a little bit different because I am just looking at an old renewal. So this right here, I think we changed some vehicles. We've got what a few trucks, a few trailers, and that's it, right. And then obviously you want to add this new SUV set. That's right. How many trucks do you think we have on there now? We've added something since this since. Three. One two three. Do we take some off and add some? No, like two, two sometimes three there from get the material from here. One is one for the installation crew. And the other one that's the one I've been using. You know sometimes I use it. Sometimes I pull the trailer with it and but when I go out with the like to the dealer that's what I use for my like an our personal. Vehicle so. I got you. Okay. I was just trying to see what kind of rates we're looking at here. So three trucks like three trucks and three trailers is what we have on there something like that. All right. Yep. And your premium for the year was only around ten. Yeah, where was it? There it is. So around this is whatever it was at at the renewal it was like ten thousand one hundred for the commercial auto for three trucks and three trailers which is pretty good these days. Okay, let me just talk to the underwriter German and see what she says. Hopefully we can just drop that the auto line of business off that policy and keep the general liability and indemnity that way that'll cover all of your and your property obviously and that'll. Keep your manufacturing and your installation GL and indemnity and and all that sort of stuff together and see if we can just find auto somewhere else. I will say. You know with your loss history, it may be a little bit difficult to find coverage and it certainly may be a
