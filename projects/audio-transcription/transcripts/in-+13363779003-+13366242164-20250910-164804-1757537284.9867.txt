Thank you so much for calling Alliance Insurance. Hey, um, I was calling to check. I just got a letter from my mortgage company that um, I guess I didn't have insurance on my home, but I thought some I thought it was fixed like two months ago, so I just need to check to make sure. Um, because I don't want to pay you too far. Of course, I understand. Give me one second. Let me get an agent for you, okay? So I can review it with you. One second.
