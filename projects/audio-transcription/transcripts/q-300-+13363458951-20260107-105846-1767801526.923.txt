It's a great morning, Alliance Insurance. This is Jamie. This is Jamie. My name is Jamie. Yes. Hi Jamie, this is Greg Bailey. I was had some water damage at one of my rentals. At seventeen oh six Grant Avenue. Let me find you here, Mister Bailey. Give me one moment. Sorry to hear about the water damage. Is Corbin in office today? He is. He is currently in a meeting. Though that I share I share space with him. He's probably on the other side of the drywall there, and that meeting is still important going on. Let's see. Okay. Have a. Attached to your name, there is Esther May Myers heirs, and there is a dwelling fire policy active there. Would that be the account that is under? Yes. Okay. One moment. Let me get this thing up. Okay. Let's see here. It's trying to load for me. I think I got it here. Well, here when Mister Bailey says, "Is going to put this on." Oh, take the time. God love technology sometimes. Let's just say, go. Let's see. Shows active in my system. It just won't let me view it. Let me search it a different way. Esther May Myers appears. Gosh, I think I would probably have to call this in for you, Mister Bailey. Let's let's talk this through and I will I can call the carrier directly and have a conversation with them and process anything that needs to happen. This system's been very difficult. So you say you had some water damage at at a rental property, was it? Yes. Yes. Have you? I guess first question would be when did you notice the water damage? Was it recent? Last day. Last week. It was like three days ago. Three days ago. Okay. That would have been the Sunday the fourth of January. January. We make it. I think it was like Friday or Saturday. Okay. Saturday the Saturday would have been the third. So we'll put we'll put January third on there. Twenty twenty six. Okay. And tell me about a little bit what happened. It was this water that came in from the outside of the structure. It come from the roof. Did it something pop inside? It was yeah, the water damage is in the bathroom from a leaking a leaking toilet. Toilet okay. And has the leak been stopped as of right now, or is it still currently leaking? It still needs to be attended. Okay. Did the water back up out of the toilet, or did it? Was there something that came from under the base? See from under base. Okay. And then have you gotten any quotes as to repairs? Any any plumbers been out to take a look at it to give you any kind of estimates as far as the damage. Not yet. Okay. All right, and then I'm going to guess that the answers no, but I probably still need to ask you any kind of injuries with this or is this just probably no injuries. Okay. How much is my deductible for seventeen oh six? Well, that's that's honestly what I was looking for there, and this thing's been difficult. It won't let me see it in my system. Downloaded in. It looks like there is a one thousand dollar deductible on the policy. Now I'll be honest with you, Mister Bailey. I'd like to verify that live on the portal before I push this forward for you. But based on information that is downloaded into my system, our software, it looks like there's a thousand dollar deductible on this policy. So I guess that does lead me to the question. You know, based on flooring and whatever else is in there, do you think this would be north of a thousand dollars in damage that that it had inflicted? Any idea? I'm not really a professional, but I would guess. Yes. Okay. Okay. The reason why I ask is because I don't work for the insurance carrier. You know, and I want to help guide you the best I can. In the event that this was a seven hundred dollar fix or eight hundred dollar fix, Mister Bailey, I would tell you not to file a claim. You know it stinks all the way around, but I would tell you to have a pocket and move on with life. If you think this would be north of a thousand dollars, then I would be comfortable pushing this forward into a claim for you. Now whether or not the claim would be covered, I don't have any kind of legal authority to tell you yes or no to that. In the event that you push this forward into a claim, the carrier would assign an adjuster. The adjuster would come out and look at it, make the determination as to whether or not coverage would be applicable, and then they would cut you a check or call a plumber. They can see you off of that. But as far you know
