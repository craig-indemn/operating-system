Hello. Hey, Callie. Hey. Hey, it's Holly at Alliance. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good. I'm just giving you a call. I've looked at our options for your renewals. I just wanted to call back if you got a minute. I do, but um, you know, the situation I'm going through, you know, with that, that lawsuit or whatever. Yeah. Well, the insurance company is giving me legal assistance. Okay. Yeah, I don't know if I need to be like, I'm thinking need to wait. Um, well, it's totally up to you. Um, usually. I mean, can I do it even after? After the fact. Yeah, we can do it anytime. Um, the auto. I have looked at all our options. It looks like it's going to be best to keep the auto in the home separate and keep the auto with progressives. Uh huh. I have another quote for the home that's going to get your deductible down and save you a little bit of money. So, um. But we can do that at any time if you want to wait until they settled. Yeah, I kind of do because yeah, while they're helping me and stuff, I don't want to yeah, you know. Yeah, yeah. That's that's. Your renewal's on the 30th, so if it gets done by then, we can do it. If you if it if it takes longer, we can do it whenever. There's no penalty for moving a homeowner. Okay. All right. Well, I will. I'll remember that and yeah, as soon as it gets over, I will be calling you. Okay. Okay, sounds good. All right, thank you, girl. Thank you. Have a good day.
