Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hi, good afternoon. This is Hershaw. I'm calling on behalf of Bank of America. He's been informed that this call will be recorded and monitored for quality and training purpose. I just wanted to verify the issue date on a reinstatement document. Would you be able to help me with that? Um, I cannot. Um, can I give you an email address for you to email that request over? Um, no, actually I don't have the access to email. Okay. Um, so hold on, let me see if I can get you over to an agent. What what's the policy number? It's five five four four one six zero. So five five four four one six zero. Isn't Michelle and Scott Milford? Yep. All right. So hold tight just a moment. Let me put you on a rephone. Okay.
