Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hi, this is Patty from AAA Insurance calling. How are you today? I'm good. How are you? Good, thank you. I'm not sure if you can help me, but I have a client, Mathis, and Hilda Mayor. They recently started their insurance policy here with AAA, and I'm trying to get a copy of his previous deck pages. And the only thing he was able to bring into me was a copy of his LPR. Are you able to send that to me or send it to him? That he could send to me. What's his name insured? It's Matt Hias and Hilda. Last name is Mayor. M A Y E R. All right. Let me get you an agent that can help with that. Okay. Okay, thank you. You're welcome.
