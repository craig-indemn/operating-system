Thank you for holding us, Jaycee. I might help you. Hi, Jaycee. My name is Mia. Um, I have a little situation. Oh yes, Mia. Yeah. Yeah, I left your voicemail. Um, I didn't know if you wanted to reinstate that auto policy. So I have an idea. I don't know if it could work. Please keep in mind that I'm literally just an 18 year old trying to figure this whole thing out. Okay. Basically, I all right now I have I'm a full time student with side working so you know there's that but I pay full my car insurance which is very high because I'm a new driver my I pay rent and I pay my phone bill so last month I remember calling the insurance company and saying hey I don't really know because there any way y'all can help me out a little bit because I will not be able to pay my car payment this month my hours are cut at work and pool starting up and that's kind of why and they're like yeah you know I thought we figured something out but in fact five which I completely understand it's kind of on me as well I wasn't paying attention I will not be able to pay last month and this month by the end of this month but I can pay the 270 or 80 I think literally this Friday and then I can pay the other one from last month which is like 320 something I'm pretty sure I will 100 be able to pay that and the next two weeks if there's any way that I can do that and then I'll track to reinstate your policy National General National General is going to require that you pay the full amount for 348 dollars and 50 cents they're not going to reinstate your policy with just partial payment they do need that full amount to reinstate it okay is there any way that we can switch it like I'll pay the how much did you say 340 or 300 348 and 50 cents okay can I pay that this Friday and then we push the this month for like both of them next month if that makes sense so I would pay the I'm pretty sure we bumped it down 200 after that got after I had to pay the other one so if I pay the 270 in the next two weeks and then the follow like for that next month the end of that month as well so two payments next month and then the 300 one this Friday you're wanting I'm just trying to make sure that I'm understanding you you said you want to pay the 348 dollars and 50 cents to well this Friday and then you want to make two payments for next month is that correct it's not okay yes just so I'm back track because I also have this month as well the 300 is from last month so I will be able to pay that Friday okay um well I don't have full access to the billing being that it is canceled okay okay so I don't know what that would look like for for next month I I really don't want to give you misinformation okay um who would I be able to go to because I know that my I don't know if it's like my personal person who helps me with this but her name is Heather she's very kind she I don't know if I go to her but normally when I go to her about anything she tells me to go to National General which every single time I do it's a robot so that doesn't really help but um I don't like how how would I be able to figure this out who would I need to go to well being that the policy is canceled there's not a lot anybody can do at the moment we would have to reinstate the policy to have access to the billing wait could I um let could I do this could I just call you guys um can I call you Friday the day that I get paid like this Friday and reinstate it by taking that out of my account Friday yeah okay um well it so it's canceled so nothing will deduct from my account unless I reinstate it so yes that payment that was supposed to go through the 18th did not go through it's canceled um yeah currently right now we just need to pay make that payment of 348 dollars and 50 cents okay um so Best Buy is calling you guys back Friday and doing that yes do you think um just by guess because I know you can't give me anything you know you can't give me straight up just by guess do you think I will be able to make this month's payment and next month's payment both next month for the beginning of next month and the end of next month do you think I would be able to do that um let me see let me see if National General can give me an answer and you're saying okay so this last payment that you made was when was the last payment
