Shane is scary. How are you? I hang up, Garrett. I'm doing well. I found that information. If you're ready for that loan number. Okay, just a second. Let me get something right with you. Go right ahead. It's zero seven five seven six eight seven six four five. And that's the customer service number. I guess, through Mr. Cooper, I said Mid America sold to basically. And then the only number I see is eight eight eight four eight zero two four three two. Two four three two. And who do you have anything on there showing the address? That needs, where the address needs to be sent. Oh, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll look. I've got to find it again. Because the most of the mortgage companies, they have a specific terminology that they want on the policy. And I was just wondering if that was shown on there anywhere. No, says please do not send mail to their Ohio PO box. I know it was in Texas, but God, I can't remember. Till I get another thing. I'm going to kind of look at right now. Well, see, we just need to be specific on where we send the billing to. Yeah. As a www dot mr cooper dot com. I can try to use that. And go online. Oh, right here to. Municipal renewal payments right here. It's got a list. Okay. Overnight delivery is Texas insurance renewal bills. Yeah, I'd see it right there. PO box seven seven two nine Springfield Ohio. Four five. Five zero one. Dash seven seven two nine. Okay. Yeah, right here shows where I send the payments Dallas Texas. Okay. Yeah, we need to send it to the insurance address. Now I just need that that address for the insurance. Because they pay it for you, correct? Yes. Yeah, see if they pay in that budget. That's where we need to send it to. Yeah, I want to send the insurance for notes and bills. Yeah. Now, next thing I need to tell you: Do you want me to go ahead and get it released? Do you mean to start it? Yes. Yeah. What did I go up from last year? Really wasn't that bad. I don't think. Three hundred dollars, something like that. Just a minute. Let's see. Think it went from like eight thirty to nine ninety six or something like that. Let me get your money. Get the account pulled up here a bit. I was working on something else here, so just spare with me just a minute. Oh, fine. Fine. Yeah, you were at eight thirty last year. And it and it went to that nine ninety six. And you just have trust me on this. That is a very it's very reasonable based on some of the ones I've been dealing with here. Because I've seen a lot of them get up three, four, five hundred dollars a year. And the coverage is a little bit better as well. I mean, you got a little more coverage too. So. Yeah, I know that. Yeah. Um. When I release this, it will produce an application for me, and I will email that to you. And it can be signed by e signature. So all you have to do is open it up, follow the directions, and click the sign, and it comes right back to me. And then once we do, yeah, once we do issue it, the company will bill. The mortgage company, so you don't have to worry about any of that. I will try to get it out today. If if not, no later than tomorrow. Just watch your email. You know over the next couple days or even the weekend. To see that, and and you should be good to go. Okay. If you have any questions on any of it, just call me back. No, I'm pretty well fine. I read through it and everything looked good to me. Good deal. But just keep in mind you can call me if you need to. Okay. Okay, I will. Thank you, friend. All right. Thank you, Garrett. Have a good weekend. Bye bye.
