Hello. Hey. Hey. Can you help me with something? I have a walk-in. Sure. Are you wanting to change the coverage on? He said just a liability on both vehicles. Can you help me change the coverage? On the. Absolutely. Before he makes his payment, he wanted to change it. Oh, okay. Let me pull it up here real quick. I think Heather's in pilot. She could be in Winston. I don't know where she's at today. Um. This morning. I know what that was yesterday. I have no idea where she's at today. No, and I was like, I can call Tracy. I think I can get Tracy to help me. Yeah, I can do that. Let's see. I think it is account to come up. Oh, cool. It's auto owners. I love when it's auto owners. Must it be easy? Yeah, exactly. A car. Looks like somebody. Did something yesterday. Yeah, Heather had done had like worked it up. That's reason I was trying to find her, but I didn't know where she was at. Okay. Um. Let's see, what are we doing here? I'm looking to what she did. I think she did it a couple different ways. Okay, and I'm going to totally ignore hers and just do my own because I don't want to do the wrong thing here. What changes does he want to make? You don't want to change anything else like the. What was it else that Heather had mentioned? Yeah. So she did the quote both ways. Okay, so you just want to take it just a liability on both vehicles. Okay. Yeah, he just said just make both vehicles. So he wants to drop the 2019 Cruz down to liability only as well as the Silverado. Okay. That will looks like that makes his premium 793. 96. It goes up. What is it now? This thing. What what amount did you just say? 793. 96. Yeah, right now it shows 71764. Is that for the whole year? No. One time payment. Looks like he pays them like annually. Yes. So there's still the 71764. So this would per. Hang on one second. Okay. Okay, sorry, my Amazon thingy was going off. Um. I'm not quite sure how it's going to impact. Yeah, it shows 71764 is due today. But the total premium drops down to 793. 96. Oh, okay. So that's for the. Yeah, so it's going to change it to 291 dollars. So I don't know what it's going to shake out to. Okay. So what do we need to do? Um. Tell him that it's got to. Go through an update on their side. Okay. And then we can see what's left to pay if anything. Okay. So we need to wait until at least Monday. Yes, it should be done by Monday. Yeah, but she said that it's not showing us what it is. It have you have to give the change time to go through. So it's not showing us the actual amount. That is due. So she said we can wait till Monday. To see what the amount's going to be or what else would even be due. It doesn't show me the installment amount. It only shows me the total amount. It's not going to cancel though. There's is not. Oh no, he's got time. You've got plenty of time with them. They're not going to cancel because of that. So come Monday, we could we can see what the payment's going to be. She said. Yeah, there's a grace period and this will update before that grace period is even over. Are you wanting to pay this full amount? She doesn't know the amount that is due though. Is what she's saying. So I don't know amount to tell you to pay. Yeah, that's the amount that's going to take it off. It's exactly what she's got. He's wanting to pay something before he leaves. Um. Well. I took the 71764 and subtracted the 291 credit, and that will leave 426. 64 cents. Not saying that that's going to be the actual amount, but that's what I come up with. You said the 426. Yep, 426. 64. He can do 426 even. They're not going to bill him for 64 cents. Okay. She said you can do 426 if you want to pay that. But we don't know the actual amount still of what it is. Okay. Yeah. Because if it if
