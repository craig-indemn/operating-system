Hello, this is Heather. Hey, Heather, this is Debbie. I'm sorry, I couldn't take your call. I was speaking with someone at the Kia. Oh, okay, please. Yeah, well, I just like a voicemail. I got yours, so yeah, what I was just saying in the voicemail was that you don't have to fool with travelers. We'll call, we'll take care of canceling that policy. When we rewrite it to PNC, we'll cancel the travelers and then they'll refund you. I know you said that PNC has already mailed the premium to them, and it's fine. It happens, we do this all the time. So that's no big deal. You'll just you can just whenever you get the refund, you can apply it back to your escrow. So it's not short, yeah, because they'll issue another check to PNC. Okay. So yeah, yeah, okay, and that'll um, yeah, okay, yeah, and the Kia gentleman is sending me an email with that information about the auto theft thing. And do you want me to send it to your email? Yes, ma'am. Yep, you can forward that right on to me. Do you have my email? I just emailed those proposals earlier, so you should have it. Yeah, okay, all right. That sounds good then. Yeah, yeah, I've got Heather's at myallianceinsurance.com. That's right. Yes, yes. Okay, all right. Well, thank you. Okay, I sure will. Debbie for joining now. Okay. Thanks. Later. Okay, not.
