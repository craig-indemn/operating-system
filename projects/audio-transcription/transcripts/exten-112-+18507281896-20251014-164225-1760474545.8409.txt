Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hey, Brandi. It's Jen Rockley. Hey, how are you? Good. How are you? Good. Let me get you pulled back up here. Did you get the email of the umbrella policy? Um. Let me see. Ah, just did. Yeah. It was actually a lot less than what I thought it was going to be, but that's because of, um, the girls being excluded from that policy, so they won't. They they're not covered under the umbrella policy. It's just you and Dan. Okay, so none of our girls get included. No, because since Ruth has the has the points and she's the one that's had that the two accidents. They can't just exclude her. They have to exclude every youthful driver on the policy under the age of. I forgot what he said. Um. I think it was twenty four. Say that again. I think it was under the age of twenty four. They'll have to exclude the youthful driver. So anybody that's in the household under twenty four will be excluded. Until those points come off, and then the umbrella policy will include them. At that point. So what does that actually mean? Like if something happens in our house, that is related to them at all. Like if they're friends or like how does I don't understand how an umbrella policy. So basically, it's um. For for them, it would really just cover them like on the auto side. Okay. Oh, gotcha. You and Dan own the home. Okay. So. That that's more of what I am worried about. Like anything that. Y'all are going to be held liable. Y'all are responsible for the kids. So either. Okay. Either way, it would land on y'all. Now if they are driving in a, you know in the car, and they cause a big accident, then it's just going to come from your auto policy and it's not going to transfer over to the umbrella policy because they are excluded. Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay, I just wasn't sure how that would work. Okay. Um. Let me look at the numbers then. So it's three ninety seven a year. Yes. Okay. All right. Yes, that sounds good. And then I did send. No, I did not send. Uh, send it to you. I just texted you about it. The home policy. I went ahead and issued. That policy because I definitely want to make sure that we have coverage on it for tomorrow. Yes, thank you. So I didn't want to miss out the auto. We can you know wait talk about we can issue that whenever but the home I want to make sure that that had coverage on ten fifteen. Okay. Now I can update the billing. Now one thing: whenever I was going through that policy before I hit the issue button, I noticed that I had a discount on there that I could not apply to it because we did not put your auto with auto owners. We did it with National General. Gotcha. That increased it a little bit more, but you would still have a paid in full discount. Um, if y'all wanted to do that, um, if not. I now that I am thinking about it, I don't think that makes sense, especially for thinking about moving. You know. Right. Yeah. So I mean, if if you have the mortgage pay for it, then it's seven thousand three hundred and ninety eight dollars, and then like you said, you move if you move in. January or February, you are going to get that reimbursement back to you. Okay. And then, so I've already got that taken care of. I would just have to change that to escrow build, so they'll send the bill to the mortgage company. Okay. And I will send it to them as well because they asked us for proof of insurance. Um, so I can send that over to them too. They'll have. They'll have thirty days to pay for that. So. Okay. You are active as of tomorrow with even with. Okay. Um. The auto policy nothing changed with it. Um. I have double checked everything. Um. There was and I don't remember if I went over this or not. National General has an app called Dynamic Drive. I use it, um, and it really doesn't bother me as much. I can turn off the notifications to it. It gives you a discount on the auto policy. Um. So every driver has to download the app onto their phone. Like I said, turn the notifications off because if not, it will drive you crazy. But just download it and put in the information and it basically tracks the driving whether you are on the phone. It'll pick that up if you are speeding, hard braking. I I do speed a lot,
