Thank you for holding me, Misses Heather. How can I help you? Hi, this is Grid Valencia. Um, I was calling because I thought that one of my cars had full coverage, but I apparently it doesn't. Um, and we talked the other day, right? Yes, yes. Okay. Hurtah is the last name. Uh, yeah, or Valencia. I'm not sure which one. You have, down. Looks like this is liability only, and has been for a while. Okay, because I thought that whenever you were like still paying for a car or you had a lender, you had to have full coverage. Yeah, I mean usually if there's a lien holder, then they do require that. So it looks like the 2019 Volkswagen. Um had coverage. And this was let me see when it was removed. Yeah, it looks like this was removed in 2024. Hmm. Because I don't remember removing that. Um, it was probably due to Jose. They never received license information. Oh okay. They would have sent a letter as well asking for that information. And if not, then they will remove physical damage. So does Jose have a license? No, but I don't. I don't know why you would need that if he doesn't drive any of my cars. Does he live in the household? No. Do we have proof that he lives somewhere else? Because this is where that would have came from. Okay. Yeah, I don't know about that. Usually it's based on household members. I was trying to see if there was. Risk alert. Yeah, I mean this all seems to stem from Jose. So anytime there's anyone in the household over 14 years old. They want to know if they're licensed, and if they are, that's fine. If they have other insurance, and we can list that on the policy. Okay. Um. Do you want me to research this a little bit and see exactly what happened, and then I can get back with you tomorrow? Hmm. Well, no, I see like kind of what happened, but. Yeah, I mean. That's fine. Yeah, because I mean we'll need to clear it up. That way we can get the coverage added back onto the Volkswagen because that's probably what has happened, right? Your lien holder is asking for coverage. Um. Well, no, because the the lady from the insurance called and she was. She was just saying that it wouldn't be covered even though it was totaled. Because it was liability only. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. I got you. Okay. All right. Um. I mean, I can look into this just to see if there's anything we can do. Just to see if they would you know possibly reverse it, more than likely not. But I mean it's worth a try since there is a totaled car situation. Okay. Um. Yeah, I guess that's fine. Okay. Give me a little bit of time and I will give you a call back probably in the morning. Well, it won't be in the morning. I have training. So let's just say after lunch tomorrow. Um. Well, is it okay if you call me like around four? Yeah, yeah, that's fine. That will work better for me as well. All right. Thank you. Bye. Sorry.
