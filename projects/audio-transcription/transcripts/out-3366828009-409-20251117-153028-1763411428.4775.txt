Hello. Hey, this is Corbin with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Hey Corbin, I'm good. Thank you for calling me back. Yeah, yeah. What can I help you with? Um, I've received two bills for my auto insurance on the same day, but I haven't received a bill about my home loan. Oh, okay. Let me look. Henry, I'm gonna go home. You're gonna stay here. I talked to a representative from Auto Insurance and they said they sent it out October 13th, but I never received it. We got the auto right, 100439. Yep. Becky paid 50620 already. Okay, perfect. And then the home. It's like eight something right. You got the fee waived. The home's coming in. Looks like a bill went out on to 7703 Antoinette Drive, Richmond, Virginia 23227. That's correct. Cancellation notice enclosed and then right there it's got the bill for. 51932. But you didn't get that. I didn't get it. Huh. And I'd rather I tell you I had so much trouble with my last insurance going online and trying to pay online. You told me to you want to put on AutoPay. Huh. You want to do AutoPay. Or do you just want to call me and make a payment? I could make it. Well, I just rather write in my check, but I send it to you. Is that right? Well, it's easier to send it, send it to them. Let let me just let me email it to you real quick and make sure you get it. Okay. That way, got everything under the same page. Looks like they waived. They waived 19 dollars off this bill, so I don't know how much to what to send yet. So let's look at um. If I went in to make a payment on my own. But to do AutoPay, I'd still have to do it on a computer, right? Well, it would just automatically draft whatever you wanted to hit every so often. However, you wanted to hit it quarterly, semi annually, annually. But I still have to. I still have to go online to do that. Is that right? To set it up. Yeah. I could probably set it up for you. Okay, I work with three and four years old. And. Yeah. Well, so um, just send it to me and then I can touch base with you tomorrow. Yeah, I'll send you this one that I have here. Oh, you know it's here. Just. Just email me back and let me know you received it. Okay. I want to make sure you got it. Thank you. I got it, Corbin. Yeah, I'm gonna send it right now. Okay. All right, I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Anytime, call me back. Call me back if you have more questions. Okay. Bye bye.
