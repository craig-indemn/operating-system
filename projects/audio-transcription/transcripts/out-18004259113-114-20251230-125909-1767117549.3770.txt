Last time you called was back in the seventeenth. Well, I have the uh, I have your December well September eleventh. Someone called in. Yeah, I've called a couple times. From that date, we sent in the pictures through the claims path. And it said that they should receive them in two weeks. And we can check back at any time. That was on the twelfth. And then I called back on the seventeenth. Just wanting to see if there's an update on this or not. Right now, this does show that it was submitted over by the dust examiner Charlotte Wolf. To go ahead and reach the management department, so it is within the management department as we're processing to have this issued out. Okay, so who is it currently with? Well, currently right now it's with a management department. So it's with Upper Management at this time, which is the final stages whenever a claim has been completed by a dust examiner. Okay, and then when they send out the check. Are they sending it to the insured? Um, I we will know exactly. Um, it could be it it could be directed over to the insured directly, or if there's a direction of pay on file, then it can be submitted from you guys. Okay, and what's the approximate time that I could give the insured? Oh, I advise at least a seven to ten business days. Before the check is sent out. Correct. Okay, so seven to ten business days for this process to be complete, and then. They're allowing time for the check to be mailed out. Is that correct? Yeah, if it's determined that there is a payment that's going to be provided, then yes, it will be mailed out. Okay, so I'll just call back in seven to ten days. Yes, um, regarding to this matter here, will there be any further information of the claim? I can advise. No, that was all. Thank you. I think it will contact Universal. Thanks.
