This is Emma Mayis, cool and speaking with. Hi Erin, this is Adina with Alliance Insurance. Do you have an account or policy number? I do. Um, let me see here. So the policy number is one two nine zero four seven four seven three two. And how can we help today? So on this one, I was looking on the website. Um, it's showing me that both the auto and the home are due January the second, two thousand twenty-six for the pay in full amount. Um, I just wanted to be sure that you know that's not a cancel pending date or anything. That's the due date, is that right? So I can only see the one. It looks like the account that you provided to me is the auto policy. This one is not due until the second of January. That is their due date. Okay, all right, very good. Um, it just kind of threw me off because the effective dates were in November. So I was like, "Why in the world would it be due in January?" But as long as you are confirming, that's good. Then then I'm good. Yeah, it does confuse people a wee bit because we don't bill we uh we don't bill in advance like everybody else does. So essentially, they they have their months and then we don't bill until the following depending on when the billing dates fall. Because essentially we're we're they're paying for the coverage they already got if that makes sense. Does that kind of, um, break it down a little bit easier? Okay, and that's fine. That that's why I called. I just wanted to you know double check. Um, and I think the the home if you want to look it up real fast, I'm pretty sure that it says the same. Um, the policy number for it is five five nine zero three three four two one four. That is correct. Okay, all right, fantastic. That's all I needed. Thank you for your help. Anytime, I hope you have a great rest of your day. You too. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye bye.
