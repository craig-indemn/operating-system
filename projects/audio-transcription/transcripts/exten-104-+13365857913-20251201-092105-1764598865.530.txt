Brian. Hey Brian, this is Isabella Colin from Salesforce. How are you doing today? Good Isabella, how are you? Good. I wanted to give you a call on behalf of David and your team over here. Saw you were kind of checking out some demos. Wanted to check in before the end of the year. I think we're in a pretty good spot, Isabella. You know I think we have a. Meeting schedule with somebody this week at Salesforce to kind of go over the renewal for the upcoming year. In January, but I think we're okay right now. Okay, all right. Nothing else you guys kind of want me to pass along to David in terms of like things you maybe kind of wanted to talk about just so we were fully informed. No, not that I'm aware of. We just kind of want to go through the renewal and make sure that what we're you know what we're paying for we're actually utilizing and if not, there's something else that we should be. But I don't have any specifics right now. Okay, all right. Well, I will pass that info along to David and we will see. I believe tomorrow or not tomorrow, December 11th. December 11th. Yep. That's it. All right. Well, thanks so much. I will go ahead and write that down. Thanks so much. Okay, sounds good. Thank you.
