Hey Miss Simmons, this is Gary at Alliance Insurance. Sorry, I didn't get back with you yesterday, but I did some research on this prior to your call. And that particular policy that you have, that policy form does not include theft. Now I think it does include vandalism, but it does not include the theft. So you just give me a call back and let me know what you want me to do. I can file a claim for you if you want me to do that. But I do not think that there's going to be any coverage on there for theft based on the policy form that that you have. Just call me back and let me know. Thank you.
