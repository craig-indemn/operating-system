It's a great afternoon alliance insurance. This is Jamie. Hey, this is Jerry Hoping. Um, so I filed a claim on a camper that's insured through Utica. Okay. And they're saying that I don't have an active policy, and they're denying the claim. Um, this has been insured through Utica for years, and I can see where I paid the money. In January of this year, just like normal, but they say they can't find a policy. So I don't I'm I'm I don't know where it goes. Sounds awful, Jerry. I'm sorry you go into that. Um, I am looking here in the system. Okay. It says. It says. Yeah, it's the five two two policy. Whatever that one is. That's the one. It's five two two five zero six zero. That's what I've got here. Yeah. Um. Okay, so it looks like there is. There wasn't. Let me see. Oh my goodness, there is a bunch of notes on this. Okay, so it looks like. I know we've been going back and forth with this for weeks. Yeah, October seventh I think is when this thing first started. Okay. Um. It may have been about right because I tried to file online a couple of times and I kept getting the something went wrong message. So I thought, well, maybe it's a computer glitch. So I waited a few days and then a weekend came. And we used the camper in the meantime, and I was so I was out of town with it. And so anyway, it was. Yeah. Um Jerry, so so there there's it's so my team I'm Jamie. Okay, I am a personal line service agent. Uh, it looks like my teammate Tracy has been working on this for you. Yeah. Uh, my teammate JC has been working on this. My team Heather is also chimed in on this. Um. If you don't mind. I hear from you guys. Oh yeah, we we found it and we sent the information to Utica, but then Utica keeps sending me stuff back saying. No. So the last note in this sitting out, Jerry. Hear me when I say this. I don't have the end all be all answer to this. Okay. Uh, there is a note here in the system. That says. Uh, policy was issued manually. We do have documents on file. Insured does have covers. That's from William Bond, a senior personal lines underwriter at Utica National Insurance. Here that message got sent over on October seventeenth at eight twenty four a.m. And then Tracy and JC have been going back and forth. JC logged the call four hours ago. It says they stated the claim is still under review of the supervisor. They have not yet made contact with the insured. Uh, supervisor indicated that they would place coverage back as of Friday, October seventeenth. But what I'm saying is, there's notes back and forth on all this, and I don't know where it's currently at. So I'm going to have to put you on hold and let me get. That's. That's. That's. That's. That's. That's
