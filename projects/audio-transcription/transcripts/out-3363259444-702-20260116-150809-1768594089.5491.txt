Yellow. Lamb. Yeah. This is Rachel at Alliance here in Pollock. Yeah. Has Kathy paid that premium of twelve fourteen? Yeah, yeah, she she but she sent it in where they, where they turn around send a check out. I don't know what you call it through the bank, but that's what you did. Well, the company whenever I go into Cincinnati, it says it's in cancellation status. Effective two dollars. For twelve fourteen. So that's what I'm confused about. Well, it's paid. It's all I can tell you is the checks in the mail. Checks in the mail to the company, right? Yep. Okay, when what did you mail it? When did you mail it? Probably Sunday. Like Sunday the eleventh. Yeah. One eleven twenty six. Okay, because they they haven't got it yet. So okay, all right, that's what I need to know. Okay. All right, the Hollis you don't get it in a day or two. Thank you, Rachel. All right, thanks. Have a good weekend. You too. Bye.
