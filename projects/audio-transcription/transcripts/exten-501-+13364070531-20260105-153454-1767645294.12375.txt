They're data lines insurance Jamie. Jamie, it's Andrea Miller. How are you? I'm good, Miss Miller. How about yourself? Doing okay. I spoke on earlier today, and they, what was your name? Um. Holly. And then she left me a message and said that you guys were had questions and you were trying to reach us and or maybe you needed Jamie Nesbit. I'm not sure. Maybe. Um, well, I think the Holly had message to me. So you and I spoke on Friday, if I remember correctly. Yeah. And new home purchase. I thought you told me it was next Friday. Um. Holly told me that it was actually last Friday, and then she went into the Secco system and verified the quote, but there was some information that. Really just wanted to talk through with you. Okay, we close on this upcoming Friday, like in a couple of days. Okay. They need the insurance by tomorrow one PM. Okay, that's doable. Thank God, because I was I told Holly I was like, oh my god, this thing's already closed and they'll have protection in place. It's probably going to fall through. Give me one moment. I'm trying to get logged in to Secco right now. Thank you so much. Okay, in her notes, Joel Lang is he your husband, Andrea? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I think we have him. Reason is pulling you in as single. That makes no sense. That makes no sense. I'm gonna get Joel on here too. It'll be a marriage discounting too. Oh yeah, no, that's silly. Can lay him out. All right, so Joel Lang. What is Joel's date of birth? February 11, 1993. I hear you, sweetheart. I don't want to talk about insurance, Mom. Trying to take me a nap today. Jamie, I tell you, oh, what a day. I know, well, I literally just made myself a second, well, third cup of coffee about 40 minutes ago. So yeah. Okay, single family dwelling, built in 2004. Briton near Andrea. Do you know if this place has a craw space in it? Or is it like? Yeah. Craw space. Okay. We're going to get an idea. She'll be crazy. How old is um? How old is your little partner there? He's eight months. Oh wow, congratulations. Thank you. Yeah, she's. What else to say? I hope it stays that way. Boy, you may you may not, but you know I I think it's. I'm raising a strong opinionated woman. I'm happy to do it. That's right. And then of that. Architectural shingles, garage. Is it two car attached garage? I think that's what I saw in the pictures. I just want to make sure. Do you remember? There's there's two different garages. They're both attached: one to one car and one to two car. I'm gonna change that to three car then, just to be on the safe side. All right, standard kitchen. We're gonna change this. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay, so looking back in my notes here. Looks like you were paying 1.35 at closing, and the RCE, the replacement cost estimator, is currently coming in at 1, 000, 15, 000 400. So. I guess they're not accounting for the land, babe. Yeah. Correct. Yeah, yeah. So obviously in the event that the house was to burn down, blow away, right? We don't insure land because you guys still own the lot and you could rebuild or sell it or whatever. So the reason I'm pointing this out to Andrea is because I've seen it happen where the insurance side of the part of the of this paper trail here comes in below the loan amount. And the bank will give the client issues. So what I think I want to do here is just email you this quote, and I want you to show it to your mortgage lender. And make sure they're comfortable with this. In the event that they're not, call him right now. If you're comfortable staying on the line and talking to him through it, I think he may at least know what they think of it. So should I just give him Jamie too? Can I give him a quick call? Sure. Okay, one second. Hang on a second. Okay. And the other question I have for you. He's putting me on. He's putting me to voicemail, so sorry I couldn't hear him. It's okay. It's okay. I'm still I can still email you this. You can show it to him. Just so you don't have a headache.
