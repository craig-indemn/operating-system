Hi, you reached my voicemail. This is Teresa Taylor. Just leave a message, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you. Good morning, Teresa. This is Jamie flipping here with Alliance Insurance. I was calling you this morning just because I got a note from you regarding collision. I think on the Chrysler Town and Country and a couple other policy changes that you needed and I just want to talk that through with you on the phone to make sure that I guess you know me and us and you were all on the same page. I can confirm for you right now. I am looking at it live in front of me. The 2016 Chrysler Town and Country does have full coverage on it. You have comp and collision. Both of those coverages have a 500 deductible. Towing and rental reimbursement is also on that vehicle. But I still want to talk this through with you and just make sure that everything is up to date. So I'm in office all week this week, every day till 5 p.m. You can give me a callback at your leisure. 336-3779 zero zero three is our direct office number. My name is Jamie. Thanks so much.
