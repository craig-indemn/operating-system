You have reached Auto Owners Insurance in Lansing, Michigan. Please listen carefully. Please enter your party's five digit extension. Auto owners, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny, good morning. This is Jamie Flippin here with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Good, how are you? I am hanging in there. I have a rookie question that I am about to ask you. I am not a rookie here, but I got a weird answer the other day from another carrier and then I just got myself in a conversation with one of our insurers and I am questioning everything I know. So policy number, if you want to look at it, is okay. Hold on one second. Get there because this is a coverage question. This is a coverage question too. It's five zero eight four two three three six zero zero. Sir Jane and Gary Moore. Okay. Long story short, I just got off the phone with Jane. She's a sort of older. She told me that both her and Gary are not in good health, and their adult son Leviticus lives in with his girlfriend. He's got an active policy with Progressive. He drives the twenty nineteen Buick Encore, which is also insured with Progressive. I do need to email you proof of coverage to get that backdated and removed. He bought a policy with Progressive in October of twenty four. But here is my rookie question: Jane is in not great health, and Jerry does not drive. Leviticus will sometimes drive the vehicle will drive their vehicle to take them to run errands and stuff, and Jane is concerned about coverage following if he had a loss while driving her car. And weirdly enough, I had National General tell me the other day that in that situation that adult kid should be listed on the policy in order for buy coverage. Would a o do that? Would y'all believe Leviticus was still there? My initial thought is permitted use. I guess I am going to have to ask because it probably would depend how much they're he's using it. Yeah. But let me ask real quick here and let you know for sure. Well, I appreciate it. Hi Jamie, you still here? I am here. So you said he has his own vehicle, right? Which is weirdly enough still listed on their policy. It looks like we removed Leviticus back in October of twenty four. But we didn't remove his vehicle for some reason. Okay. And so he lives with his girlfriend. You said he moved out. Yeah, yeah, I am looking now. It's with Progressive Direct, so I have access to make sure that it's currently active. I am going to call him and verify that. But he's got a mailing address of one two seven little no place in Supply, North Carolina, which is different from Jane and Gary. But he purchased a policy with Progressive Direct on October fourteenth of twenty four for him and the twenty nineteen Buick Encore. And so what I think happened was we probably should remove Leviticus and the Buick Encore. Yeah, yeah. But they thought we didn't. We just removed Leviticus and I just got off the phone with Jane. Called me to ask questions about the homeowners policy and when we I thought I was off the phone with her but she asked me about the auto and when I went through what's on there. She got confused and then started asking me coverage questions and again I've always thought that as long as it's incidental usage. Right, and I am in. Yeah, that would be right. Somebody driving it. Yeah, like that. Is she using it a lot or is taking them places or now then yeah that would be. No, she she she said he he comes up maybe once every five or six weeks or something just to run errands with them in the car drive her to a doctor's appointment or something. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I have honestly as an agent I've had this question a hundred times. I've never thought anything about it, but National General, which is another one of my point carriers, gave me grief about it last week. Honestly, and they insisted that the adult son that doesn't live in the house be listed on the policy as a caregiver and driver of the auto. So I guess I've just now questioned myself. No, I mean in the scenario if he's not if he's not driving it, oh like all the time that's fine if it's just occasional and they you know. Okay, I would think so too. That that would be my that would be my understanding of the coverage and my assumption. I am going to stress the fact that if this increases in frequency, then we do need to have Leviticus back to the policy. Absolutely. Yep. Okay, okay, okay. Good, you've answered my question. I appreciate it. I do need to get the Buick Encore removed. I am going to push that into the Charlotte driving. Yeah, yeah
