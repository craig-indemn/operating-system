Thank you for holding. This is on, and I can help you. Yes, man. This is David Samuel, and I was holding on uh someone to tell me what my homeowners and my farm policy is going to be. So I can make the payment today. Okay, I sent you a text message back. Did you receive it? Oh, let's see. What phone number had you got for me? Um, it was to the same one that you texted us, and we responded back to you. Give me one second. Oh, okay, okay, okay. It should be. Uh no, I haven't. It's seven eight six. Uh one one three three. Is that what I've texted you? At I haven't gotten anything back yet anyway. I see. Okay, um, I'm not sure. I just responded back to the text message that you sent us. Um, but since the policy has already canceled, we can't make a payment right now. I do have to. I reached out to the underwriter. They have to approve a reinstatement first before we're able to make a payment. Okay, well, can you do that, please? Yeah, that's why I just said I've already reached out to them. I have to wait for them to respond. Okay, well, there's no claim, so I don't know why they wouldn't want to do that. It is uh, it is eleven acres smaller than it used to be. I don't know if that will help me get any cheaper. But there's eleven less acres on the farm than there was last time. But anyway, we can pay it like it was the same and take that off afterwards if you want to do that if something comes off. Okay, yeah. The only thing they're going to review is the reason why it was the payment was not made on time. Oh, well, just because I got late, I'm sorry. I'm almost a month late. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry about that. I haven't been before. You know. And that's that's just what they'll have to review. So unfortunately, right now I can't do anything until they approve the reinstatement. Um, so I've already reached out to them. I'm just waiting on a response. Do you think that deny me or something? I I don't know. Unfortunately, I can't make that call. Um, I just have to wait to see what they say. Right, do I deal with them a lot? I mean, have they denied you a lot lately? I'm just curious. Every case is different. Um, they just review each case separately. Um, if you haven't had any missed payments before, they could. You should be good to go. Like I said, I just can't tell you until they they're the ones have to review it. Yeah, I don't even make payments. I'm paying it all in one pot. So. Okay, yeah, like I said, they just have to review. Unfortunately, I don't have any access to it since it's already canceled. Um, but typically they are quick on responding. So once I hear back from them, I will reach back out to you. Okay. Yes, yes, man. I didn't ever get a text from you. By the way, so if you want to write my number down and call me, it looks like that might work better. Okay, yeah. What's the number? Three three six four zero two two two three nine. Okay. All right. Once I hear back from the from the carrier, I will keep you a call and let you know. Okay. Yes, thank you very much. Like I say, I'm ready to pay it. So I just need the no number. Yes, no worries. I will let you know once I have an update. Okay. Yes, man. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Bye.
