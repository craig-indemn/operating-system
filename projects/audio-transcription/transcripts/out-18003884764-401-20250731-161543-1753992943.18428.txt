Transferring your call to Turner Karen. This is Karen to help you. Hey Karen, it's Heather. How are you? Oh hi, I'm good. How are you today? Oh, I'm just you know I'm doing good. That's crazy. Yeah. I feel the same way. Clear it. I felt like it's been a full man for a while now. It just won't go away. Um girl, I have got. I don't know if you saw my email yet or not. I haven't. Well, it is. It's I can give you the policy number—the one I'm looking at. Okay. Her name is weird, but it's one two nine, zero four six eight three five four. Name um name um, I don't know how to pronounce her name. Okay, I got it. She's given us it. Um. So I went to remove the Honda Accord. When I did that, it has made her premium more than what. And I explained her about the you're living the multi vehicle discount, but she is having a hard time. And I get it like. I know specific would be more, but do you see anything else going on? That would help me explain why it's more with one vehicle than it is for two, other than the multi vehicle discount. That's the main thing. You know there's seven points on the policy. Okay. So that's seven points. You know the the way. Did that now? They were split between the two vehicles, but now it's all applied on that higher rated. So that's another thing. Okay, seven points. Now what's that for? Is that on her daughter or her? That is on combined. I know there were several incidents on there. Yeah. And when she when I asked, she's just a she's a peach Karen. I'm really just by this one qualified. I was looking at it. Whenever I I know whenever I went in there I'm like. That's what I was wondering. Did some of those come up while? During the time this was written, like the term or something. Did those pop up then or? I was surprised too. Let me see. Because I didn't really pay attention to it whenever I wrote the policy, but then whenever I went to remove this, I'm trying to look and see. Well, did they get another point or anything happen? You know. Yeah, because I was doing the first term. So it looks like it was a speeding four twenty-one twenty-two. And what do I? That's a one point. She has a one point speeding four twenty-one twenty-two, and this is for. The driver to the twenty-two year old. All of it's on her. And then there was an at fault accident one four of twenty-four. That's a three point. Okay. Um. Let me see. One four twenty-four. They paid. It's like thirty thousand bodily injury. On that. Thirty thousand on the yes. Yes. This one. Oh my gosh! Yeah. I'm just I'm just so yeah. If there's anything new, I will be coming off. You know, seeding it and canceling physical damage. I just like I said. I'm shocked it was eligible. But um. Let's see. Then there's another three point accident nine twenty six twenty four. Nine twenty twenty four. Okay. Yeah, nine twenty six twenty four, and that was. Collision six thousand. Two eighty seven paid out, and then property damage was twenty seven fifteen. Okay. So that's the seven points. I'm just gonna I'm not even gonna try and. Argue with her. This is what and I'm I'm so thankful you pulled this up because I was like I don't know. It's hard to explain just the multi vehicle discount and that's I was like. Maybe a point has came up since we wrote the policy and it's pulling it again. Maybe the I don't know but. Oh my! I saw the report. I'm like, well, there's a lot of a lot of stuff on there, but. Yes, it is. I mean, I didn't go into detail. Maybe I just looked and saw like there were like seven or eight different little things. So I'm like, boy, crap. I was thinking the same thing. How in the world did we even write it to begin with? Right, right. I'm like, oh, you know. Oh no. Yeah, this one looks like it's definitely substandard. You know because of that. Those
