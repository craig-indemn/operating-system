Hello. Hey James, this is Gary at Alliance Insurance. How you doing? Good, I got you now. And I don't know what happened on that first call. Yes, weird. I'm out driving in the middle of nowhere between Greenville and Raleigh. Well, Corbin, let us know that you're you're getting at Morano. Yes. And I need to get the VIN number before we can add it on there. I'll send him a picture of it. Well, he did not send that to me. Tell him I said he's a big dunny. I can send you a picture of it if you. If you want to text me, I'll text you back the picture of the bill of sale here or something with the number on it. I'll do that here in just a minute. Okay. Yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you.
