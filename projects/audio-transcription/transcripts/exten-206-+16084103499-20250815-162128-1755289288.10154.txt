Hello, this Jeff, can I help you? Hi Jeff, my name is Janice Star. I'm calling with West Bend Specialty. How you doing? Doing well, hope you are. What was your name? I'm sorry. Janice, Janice with West Bend Specialty. Hey Janice, yeah. I got the West Bend. I just didn't get the Janice. I'm sorry. Oh, that's all right. Yeah. We got your application on Gladys Memorial Cemetery. Yes. So here's the kicker: it came in two minutes after another agent sent in a special event app already for this risk. Really. And we actually yeah and we actually declined it with that agent so we have to decline it with you guys as well. It doesn't fit our special event program since they're not organizing an actual special event and I know you said vendor but with our special event short term vendors actually have to be selling a product like at a booth. With some just offering parking and parking attendant services. Yeah, that's what they're for us. That's what you're doing. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So really sorry we can help you with this one. We'll send you email so you have documentation. Yeah, I would appreciate that. And and they had they had also. You had heard from another agency on them. Yeah, they literally so they must have called both of you guys around the same time because he sent it in two minutes before your your email. And you know we had that one for a while. Before we actually I and I say a while we had it a few days and I was just getting. Some stuff from the producer and getting it ready to send in and that's why we sent it in when we did so it's. Oh god. Yeah. And it wasn't at all. You're sure it wasn't. No. Yeah, it was definitely different agent. I was like, well, that's weird. Like two minutes difference on the same day. Okay, all right. Well, Janice, I appreciate the info and yeah, if you don't mind, just shoot an email and that way I'll have it and put it with the file. We'll do. All right. Have a good weekend. You too. Appreciate it. Bye bye.
