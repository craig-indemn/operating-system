Thank you for holding, Heather. I'm sorry, hello, this is Heather. Hey, Heather, this is Tim Smith. Happy New Year, too. How you doing? Doing good. Happy New Year. I have a question for you. I started a ticket at the last hour of the on a Friday, but I wanted to. Sorry about that. I wanted to give you another vehicle VIN number for our for the said auto policy for Timothy and Albonia Smith. And I can give you that policy number. Okay, I got your policy. What's the VIN number? All right, so I'm going to sell. I'm going to sell the. I'm possibly going to sell the 2015 Lexus. And I'm going to replace it with a 2023 Lexus, and that VIN number is going to be. Let's see here. It's going to be. Maybe I shouldn't buy it. Let's see here. It's going to be 58AFZ1B10PU160155. Wanted to see what the impact would be. Okay, so I have 58 Alpha Fox Trot Zebra One Bravo One Zero Paul Umbrella One Six Zero One Five Five. Yes, ma'am. Okay, and it's you're going to do your replacement with the 15, same coverages, keep the same coverages. Okay. Whatever you recommend, if you the same coverage is what you recommend, that's what we'll go with. Is there going to be a? Are you financing this vehicle? Is there a lien holder? Yes, probably going to be a lien holder. Let me. So is there a difference in insurance if I if I buy it? Would it be a reduction? Oh, no, versus financing. It's not. No, it's not. No, it's not going to be. Let's see. Are we we have you with Cincinnati? Is that right? I know we have you with Cincinnati. I think pretty sure. Let me see here. Let me see. Yes, I'm pretty sure. Let me see here. I'm pretty sure it's a. Cincinnati Insurance Company. Yes, ma'am. So that's that's both looks like both home and auto because it gave the best rate at the time. That's right. I'm hoping it doesn't hit me too bad. Let's see. About the 2015 Lexus that we're removing. That you're trading. You're going to trade it in. Yes, ma'am. Are you at the dealership now? Oh, I'm not. I'm just. We can't come to a number as of yet. Oh, but I'm just. I'm just checking everything to see what my impact if I if I. We're about 1700 off right now, and I'm trying to resolve that. But I just wanted to see what my insurance impact would be. Okay, so we're not actually doing it. You're just you're just wanting to see it. I'm not going to endorse the policy yet. Okay. Right, is that is that what you're saying? Yes, ma'am. That's correct. I just want to see what my impact would be. All right, and this is pulling up a 2023 Lexus ES350 Ultra Luxury. Yes, ma'am. All right. So is this vehicle going to be? Is it going to be driving at primary? Like a primary driver, or is this going to be a pleasure vehicle? That's just going to be the pleasure. Okay. I still drive that truck. Okay. Yeah, so I have your deductible 250 for both comp and collision. And then we've got the roadside assistance and rental transportation on there. So I'm just going to leave that the same. That's what I recommend keeping it the same across the board. And you've got the higher liability limits, which is good. So you've got 250, 500 liability. I'm just waiting to populate the premium difference. So it's it's going to be pro-rated from now through April because that's when your your term renewed in April. Yes, ma'am. Let's not give me like a breakdown, but it is it's going to be more. Your premium from now till April is. It's 2237. See, you know what your premium was before. I can go back and look. I think that's a lot more. Yeah, 2237. Well, that's not too bad. I think that's was about 10 more. Let me see here. I still less than 200 a month. Right. What's your what's your monthly payment now? 181. So that puts me about 191. Let's see. 2150.
