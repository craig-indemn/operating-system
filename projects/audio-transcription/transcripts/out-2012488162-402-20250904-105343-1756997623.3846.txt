Oh, kid. Hello. I got it. Am I speaking with Nicole or Gabriel Sorico? This is their mom. This is a call from Alliance Insurance Services regarding something we have for you guys. It was returned to us again. I just want to confirm the address with you guys, or if maybe you guys did live in an apartment with either a unit number or a letter. Regarding it, the address we have here is one five one Kimberly Drive Boone, North Carolina two eight six zero seven. But there is an apartment number. Hold on. Okay. Let me. I'm looking it up. Um. Wait a minute. I just had it a minute ago. Let me see if it's here. I'm sorry, we're moving. Follow me, guys. Um. Taking a minute to load. I thought it was number seven, but I have to make sure. Okay. Address. Yes, apartment seven. Alrighty, thank you so much. We'll go ahead and get that updated in our system and get this note sent out to you. Thank you. You have a good day. Bye bye.
