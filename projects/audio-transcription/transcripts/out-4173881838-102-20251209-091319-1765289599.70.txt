Hello. Hey good, good morning. This is Glory. I'm calling from Alliance Insurance. How are you doing today? I'm doing fine. How are you? I'm doing great. Thank you for asking, sir. We have been trying to reach out to you because the carrier is requesting documentation for your sprinkler system. If it has been serviced this year or last year, we'd like a current the most current documentation. Yes, and in fact, I think someone came out and did an inspection from Alliance. I'm trying to remember her name, and she wrote a report on the sprinkler system. I think we're set to have the sprinkler system inspected in January of this year. Okay. Um, do you happen to have any kind of documentation so I can forward it to the carrier? So I I don't have it with me. I'm traveling right now, but the um. There was someone that wrote a report from your company. Okay, because we do not have any kind of current documentation right here, but I can um what I'll do is I'll ask. Let me reach out to Christopher and ask and let him know of this information and see how we could obtain them because we do not have any documentation and we've been trying to reach out to you since December. Since November 21st. Let's see. I'm trying to find the the gal that actually did this inspection because I took her around and it was in October. In most cases, if any kind of servicing, you'll have to call the servicing people to do that. And they write the date they have serviced and like leave you with a documentation. Okay, so this person actually was I think hired by Alliance. For the the underwriter to not just check the sprinklers but to check all of the condo and the grounds. And she did that, and she said she wrote a report. I didn't get a copy of the report, but my guess is that Chris should have had the the copy of the report. I mean, I would imagine it would have gone to Alliance. So it could be Arona sent the underwriting team to just do a survey on the property. But she but she went through and looked at all the sprinklers. In fact, she asked me she had a question about our dry system. And she took pictures of all the tags of all the inspection of all the sprinklers. I mean she she was she was pretty pretty thorough. Because here um the sprinkler servicing is done by specialized fire protection companies. No, no, no. I yes, I that's exactly right. If if you're asking me if we have, we can give you documentation of the last sprinkler inspection that we had. I mean we can I can I can get that to you. But I think there is going to be another one in January. So I I guess the question is, should we just wait until January? It'll be an up to a complete up to date inspection. So the underwriter said the only report they have is from a while ago. Let me try and see if I can pull up the information because they need a they need a fire extinguisher and sprinkler system inspection documentation. The only one they could find was from back in February of 2024. Is that the current the most current one you have? I think that may be the in this year. I think I think that may be the the most current one and it was scheduled it was originally scheduled to be done in December and the fire inspection company asked that they do it in January. Okay. Okay. So I guess I and I don't know honestly I don't know that we could get it done by December. If that's what the underwriters require, I don't know that we could get someone in here to inspect it that quick. That's why I mean we tried to do it in November, but they push it until this until January. So yeah, I don't know. I I could send you that 24, but I don't have anything newer than that right now. Okay, let me communicate this to Christopher and see what he will advise because I believe do you do the inspection on a yearly base because this one looks like it's since it's been. It's normally it's done on a in in the calendar year yes. Now may not be. It must be expired, so that's the reason why they're reaching out to request for new. It could be and and that's what I'm saying. I mean, so we we are on the docket to get a new inspection. It's just it got pushed out of the calendar year into 2026 into January 26. Okay, let me communicate that information to both Christopher and the carrier. And then if any update I should any kind of communication they give me to relay to you I will do so. It's just a good phone number to reach you because we are
