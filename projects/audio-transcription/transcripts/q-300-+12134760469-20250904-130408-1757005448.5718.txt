Thank you for holding. This is JC. How may I help you? Hello, my name is Cassandra, and I am calling on behalf of the lender, One Main Financial Services, on a recorded line for Claudia Schulte and training purposes. I wonder if I can verify insurance coverage for a mutual client. Okay, what's that policy number? It's with Progressive, and the policy number is nine five one, seven two seven eight seven two. Did you say name was Jessica? No, JC. JC. Okay, kind of sounded the same. So, forgive me. You're fine. Let's see. For Crystal and Brandon Evans, is that correct? Yes, that's the name I have on the loan. I'm looking at a 2011 Dodge Nitro VIN into nine zero five two zero. I wasn't able to locate it on the website, so I'm wondering if it was removed. Yeah, let me take a look. So it doesn't look like that policy is currently active. Okay. Okay, when did it cancel? Expired and was the vehicle listed on the policy? It's not giving me any information. Let me see. Okay, so it was canceled on the 21st. Actually, August 21st, 2023. Okay, it does, and you it have and since August 21st, 2023, they no longer with your agency. Correct. Okay, thank you for your help. I hope you have a wonderful day and a great week. Thank you. You do too. I appreciate it. Thanks. Bye. Thanks. Bye.
