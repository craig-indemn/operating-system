Hey, no problem, no problem. Sorry, I missed your call. Time at the bank. The car is the phone is in the car. So. Ah. Not a problem. Not a problem at all. So, yeah, I just had a couple of questions about the property there. Do you guys have an office yourself in that office? Yes. Okay. Not for the office for sale it for the lease. I mean, one of the two suits are empty. So we are going to give for the lease. Okay, so there's no. What I did notice is there's not really any contents coverage. On that policy currently that you sent and the policy you sent me was one that expired January of 2025. I don't know. No, the policy is going to expire this month ending. I have the policy that I missed somewhere. I need to find my current insurance. It's going to be expired this month ending one twenty eight is going to expire. I realize I have sent you the previous one. After I sent you realize. So, I'm looking my old another from the one who took care of my insurance. I need to contact for my current insurance. Hopefully she has my current one. Okay, okay, yeah, because that'll. If you need a current one, I need to need to contact her and I'll get back to you. Yeah, and that'll be fine. You can email that to me the current one later. After you spoke with her, but I need to see. Can you send me a copy of your rent roll? What do you need exactly? Your rent roll. So you lease out the tenants in the building, correct? Yes. Yes. Okay. So yeah, basically it's going to be the names of those businesses. Is normally you've got a list that basically says the name of the businesses, how many square feet they're in, and what their. What their their monthly rent is, and I can use that. And then I need to know. Wait a second. Before I go further, does that make sense to you? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah, can you email me regarding the list that you need so that I can question you exactly what you need. Okay. Do you require your tenants? Do you require your tenants to maintain their own liability? Policy and do they have you listed as an additional insured? Yeah, they have their own liability. And do they have do they have Oak Ridge Falls Realty listed as an additional insured? Yes. Okay, okay, good. So when I said rent roll, I'll explain what that is basically that you need.

And the carriers that we're going to deal with. Are going to look at that, and it may be a thing where it would not be the cost that they would reimburse you would would be willing to pay if the roof had a claim.
