Hello, Steve Adams. Hey, Steve, it's Mike Henshu here. Hey, how are you, Mike? Good. Is it cold enough for you? It is definitely cold enough for me. Yes. Yeah. I don't have to think too hard on that one. Put the chud on that. I'll tell you. Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing all kinds of stuff in this mess. The reason that I'm calling Steve, I got a packet in the mail from Signa Insurance. For health insurance. I thought we had canceled all that. I didn't want to deal with them this year. I did cancel that. Yeah, so I don't know why that's there. It's got all our names listed and. And this is recent. Yeah, I just got it in the mail. It said the policy goes into effect January the first and. Oh yes. All right, I'll I'll do a little research on it, Mike. But I know I I canceled that in December. You know I I sent it in in early. In early December or early to mid December and for the cancellation date to be December 31st, you know. So I don't know that that's kind of crazy. So but anyway, I'll research it and let you know what I can find out. It may just be something that they're. Melting out, but if they I mean, did they mail pocket cards and stuff like that too? No, the cards weren't in. It was a large envelope, a great big white envelope with about 20 pages in there. All right. So let me let me research it for you because I don't I don't add up with what we've done, but I'll research it and let you know. Okay, thank you, Steve. All right, buddy. No problem. You have a good day, Mike. So bye bye.
