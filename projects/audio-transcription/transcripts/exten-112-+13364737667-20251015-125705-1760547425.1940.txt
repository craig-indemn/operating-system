Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Thank you. Good afternoon, Brandi. This is Roxana. Yes, I was getting ready to get in touch with you. Oh, perfect. So we are able to just do your home. Okay. That's not a problem. I, they, NC Grange is okay with that. Would just do in your home. You can get a separate policy, for that other home. Since all three of y'all, on both, houses. It is up to you whether you want to ensure that other home. Okay. If we just want to focus on yours, your main house right now, and then I can work on that other one. Yes, please. Yeah. Now, let me see if NC Grange is working because this morning it was not working. I think they were doing an update to the system. Let me see if I. Oh no. Yeah, I was just calling just to make sure since today's basically you know today is the last day. I wanted to make sure if it's within the work in progress or if there's you know. Something you know written. Yeah. Processing. Yeah. So the only thing that the underwriter did say is that we will have to put some kind of label on which house is which. And it looks like on the tax card they're using. The same exact address for both homes. So do y'all like only have one mailbox or do y'all have two? Is there like an AD situation? Yeah, you could do that. I mean, it's just. It was 102, went back to 104. So it it doesn't matter. We could just you know, it could the the mail clerk write to the same address and we'll just know for what house. Yeah. Okay. So if we're if we're going to write both homes. On yours, I'm going to put 104A and then the other one 104B. That way we know which house is is which. Okay. So let me because I think there was a few more questions on here regarding the home that I needed. So bear with me just one second while I get this pulled up. Yeah, no worries. Or if you want to call me back whenever you have everything you know aligned and everything settled, I just I just called because it relates the time. And I know because today is a deadline. I just it's just like I just need to know something is being worked or you know. Go from there. Yeah, no, it's no problem. I'm getting it pulled up now. Okay, perfect. Because we don't have a lot of access to Main Street America anymore, so we can't dig up details. Of the home that might have been in there. So. Gotcha. Gotcha. Do you know how old the roof is on the on your home? How long ago did we do the roof? The roof is honestly pretty new. Hold on, let me ask real quick. I would say it's less than five years old, or five max. All right. And. Have you had any claims on that home in the past five years? No. Okay. And what type of heating system do you have? Um, air unit central. Heating. Do you know how old the heating and air conditioning is? Um. The unit. It's pretty new too. Um, let me say probably. How long have I had this house? Right after we moved in. Five years or less, maybe about five years give or take. We were definitely remodeling. Is you know, for that. All right. Let me see when you bought the house. Okay, you bought it in 2018. Hmm. 1819. So if it was done in 19. Six years. Okay. And what about electrical? Have you done any updating with that? No, ma'am. No, okay. And the plumbing systems are they PVC or copper or? For my understanding, they're PVC. Okay. Yeah. All right. I think that's all I needed to continue. So I'm going to just finalize a few things, make sure that I have everything correct, and then I will email you. Over the final quote of everything, and I think yesterday I confirmed your email address in. NC Roxy Two at gmail dot com. Yes, ma'am. That's correct. Okay, I will send you here just shortly a finalized copy of the. The application or the quote, and if you can, I'm going to text you if you can get. The driver's license for your husband and your sister. Because I'll add them to the policy as well. Okay, no problem. I could do that as well. Okay, all right. Well, I will send everything ever seen. Okay. Okay. Thank you. You're
