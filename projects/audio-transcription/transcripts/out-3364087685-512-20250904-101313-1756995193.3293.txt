Hello, Tracie. Yes, sir. Hey, sir, it's Joe with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm doing well, Joe. How are you, buddy? I'm doing great. Just want to try to catch you again and follow up where we left off. All right. I don't know if you got my email on my voicemail, but I didn't forget about you. I tried to reach out to you the other day. Hang on just a second, Tracie. Okay. I've got my notebook. Sorry about that. You there? Yes, sir. Oh, sorry about that. Yeah, I didn't forget about you. I reached out to you. I guess it was probably last week. I didn't get you. Wanted to follow up again this week. About you know you want to know about that increase. I think you increased about 10. Y'all want to know you and Rocky want to know about the increase on the policy. The only or the clearest response I got from our underwriting team, the carrier, is that the ISO rating had increased. The ISO I'm not sure if you're familiar with the ISO. This is the insurance rating for your area. Insurance service office. We all have one. Everybody has one. So fire protection class code. And what it means for insurance purposes, how well does that area in that community? Are set up to respond to fire fire calls. So how well does the fire department, whether it's volunteer, paid for the local government or whatever, how well are they equipped to respond to? Community fire calls. The rating goes from one to ten. One is the highest level that's the best fire protection you can have. Ten in the case that's the lowest that's that's the worst category. Every every property household, commercial building whatever we all have an ISO rating. So anyway, so what they explained to us was that your region your area's ISO rating had increased. So which means it's it's gotten worse on the fire protection response. Now what I can't tell you is why that is. I don't have that data to tell you. Did a fire department close? Did they volunteer manning go down? Did they lose a water source? Or a variety of those related things to fire protection. I don't, Joe. I'm I'm I'm dead in the middle of the city, with with two fire engines for the city of Winston Salem, less than less than four miles from my business. How can my rating get worse? Well, and that's just I don't we don't have that data. We as the agency don't don't have that data. What I have seen in the past, Tracie, and this is dealing more with our residential customers. What I've seen in the past is: did a fire department close down? Did they consolidate or merge their services with another joining region? Did they lose a water source? Hiring personnel? Did they lose manning? Some of those key factors drive that. Now I've asked the question and I haven't gotten a good response yet. Hey, to that point, what has determined that increase? What has determined that change? I just I don't have that data for you yet. We don't we don't collect that. That's a state government. The fire department's volunteer and local government paid staffing. They report those numbers to the state. The state in turns gives it to the Department of Insurance. Department of Insurance gives it to the carriers in our state, and then that's a rating factor. So that's the best I have for you at this point, Tracie. I just don't have anything more than other than. Hey, what's the cost to live in? It wasn't you know volume on your revenues increased. It was the ISO rating has increased in your area. So okay. I'll keep digging. I know we're about four weeks from renewal. I didn't want you I didn't want you to think I neglected you because I hadn't. It's just that's as far as that's as far as I've gotten it. Okay. Now I'll I'll tell you this and it's it's insulting to me to have to tell you this, but I'm going to tell you anyway. So we asked for credit on the account. We asked, hey, is there any consideration? We plan our case long time customers, good customers. No client. I mean, just a good account. Tracie. And I'm sorry to tell you this. Their response was, we can credit you 125. You gotta be kidding me. No, that's as flexible as they're going to be with an increase in ISO rating. So two things. Probably now and that sucks from a human level, on a professional level. That's embarrassing. That's insulting. And I'm I I apologize for that. Just it ain't my money.
