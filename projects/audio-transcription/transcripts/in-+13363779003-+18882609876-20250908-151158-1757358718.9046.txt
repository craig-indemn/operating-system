Good afternoon, thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Very good afternoon, ma'am. My name is Ashwini Parveen. I'm calling on behalf of Mister Cooper to obtain renewal information on Hazad Homeowners Policy. So this call may be monitored and recorded for quality customer services, and I'm sorry it's a Hazad Fire Policy. Will you be able to assist me with the renewal information, ma'am? So in order to um to obtain renewal information, we do ask if you request it to our support email. Is that something you can do at this time? Um, sure, ma'am. Before that, can you please spell out your first name and the initial of your last name for record purpose. A S H L E Y P S and Peter. Thank you so much, Ashley. Ah, is it a good email? Yes, support s u p p o r t. Uh huh. My M Y. Alliance A L L I A N C E. Insurance all spelled out. Dot com. All right, that is support at myallianceinsurance dot com. Right. Correct.
