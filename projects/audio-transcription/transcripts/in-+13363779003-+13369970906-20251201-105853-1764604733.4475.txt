Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hey, you know I need to um I need to do two things, I need to um I guess check and see if my payments come out automatic draft, and I need to check on my claim to see what's going on. Okay, is this John? It is. All right, John. Which policy are you checking on the draft for? The draft. It'll be wait, say it again. Which one am I looking for the draft on? I am looking for the claim. The claim. Now um so the billing question um is it on the TCJ smart or is it on the home policy with Universal? I thought it was the same. It will be the TCJ. I think has a mole on there. Okay, all right. Um yeah, so let me let me look here and I can see if it's what the billing is showing. It's going to take me just a second to get logged in there, and then as for the claim, I can pass you over to an agent to help you out with that. Okay. Is it um has? Let me see here. Have you already been talking to someone about the claim? Yes, long story short, I want to say I talked to y'all, did made the claim. After that, I talked to my adjuster and he act like he was coming out. Ted Dyer said he was coming out to I guess assess everything and assess the damages or whatever. And that was last Monday. I think he was supposed to come by. He never came by and I reached out to him. I think Wednesday, and he was acting like something wasn't done to why I guess he didn't come out. Because when I asked him about it, he was acting like something wasn't done to why I guess his his side wasn't done. Okay, okay. So um so what I can do um let me see here let me see, it looks like Jamie's on the phone so let me put you on hold by logging in looking at the billing maybe he'll be off the phone by then okay.
