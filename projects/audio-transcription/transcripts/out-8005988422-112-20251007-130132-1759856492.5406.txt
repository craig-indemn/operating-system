Hey Jasmine, this is Brandy with Alliance Insurance, and I was calling on a policy that we have no access to online. There's actually been a claim that's been filed, and the claims, I guess, adjuster or team is needing a declarations page for this policy. And we have called in several times. There's been a ticket number that we have. We just I mean the claim is on hold because they don't have a declarations page, a current one. So I'm just trying to figure out what's going on. So you just need a declaration page sent to you. What's the policy number? Five two two five zero six zero. The last time I called and tried to get one, y'all couldn't see it either. But it was paid in full. But for some reason, on that on y'all's end, ours end, we can't access the policy. Yeah, I'm still unable to get into this policy. I have a ticket number that they gave us the last time. But this I mean we're going on week number two now. We have not heard anything. And claims department keeps calling us trying to get a deck page, but we can't get it. Okay, what's the ticket number that you have? Inc. Zero seven one nine zero nine seven. So claims submitted a declaration or sorry, they submitted a ticket for you. Not claim for the declaration. I guess it's underwriting or whoever. I guess the initial person like you that I talked to to try to get one. They did something. And gave me a. Do you recall? You recall who you spoke with. No, I would have to go back through our recording calls. Like I said, this was September. 29. Okay. Um, because from the billing aspect of the policy, I cannot pull up. There are no notes pertaining to this ticket number or how far along they are in the process. Um. Well, the insured is calling us every other day, trying to figure out what's going on if he's going to be able to get the vehicle fixed anything like that. And claims won't talk to him because they don't have. A deck page, so now he's just getting. I mean, he's frustrated. He's irritated, but there's nothing I can do about it. But just to check in, and I get told same thing every time. So. I don't know what we need to do or what happened on in the in Utica system, but. Um. I don't. I don't know what else to do. Okay. All right. You need one moment, please. Okay. All right. So what I did was I did submit another ticket. I'll give the our ticket number together. I'll keep an eye on this one, and I'll take your callback number, and I will reach out to you directly. Once I get an update, because the issue here is that I don't I don't have access to that ticket number that you provided. That was submitted with the other representative, so I don't know how far along they are in the process with that. And without a name, unfortunately, I don't know who to reach out to. So I did expedite this one. And let them know that there is a current ticket out there. We can't pull the declaration page for this policy. I don't even have a policy in a system that we use to pull the declaration page. So. I'll reach out to you once I get a response. Hopefully, you should hear something from me before end of day, if not by tomorrow. Okay, and what is that new ticket number and your name? So my name is Jasmine. Ticket number is Inc. Zero seven two zero five three
