Just make sure you complete any audits or anything that you receive for your policies. Okay. Uh huh. Does that make sense? Uh, what do you mean, lady? Like audits, so just like you do your audits at the end of the year. You know how you do an audit at the end of every year. No. Okay. Oh, is it not needed? I would. Yeah, so whenever you cancel a policy, even if you cancel it in the middle of your term, you still have to complete an audit. Okay. To report all of your payroll and stuff. Yeah, it looks like your audit for last year never got done either. The one that ended back in June. Um. But the one that you had that ended. In 2024, it looks like you did that audit or somebody did it for you. Uh huh. So yeah, you you got to make sure you comply with your audits because if you don't, then you're going to end up having a bunch of money owed and go to collections and stuff like that. Oh, well, what we we do everything but nobody answer me. Uh huh. Because I I send the papers and everything to the audit and nobody, tell me nothing back. Okay. Um. Just whatever you get your audit information back on, you know whenever they send you information about your audit, just make sure you comply with that and you complete it. Okay. Mhm. But I will email you the cancellation forms this afternoon and get the policies canceled for you. And if you go back to in you know installing again, just let me know. We'll try to get you new coverage. All right. All right. All right. All right. Thank you, Juan. All right. Thank you. Yes, sir. Bye. Bye.
