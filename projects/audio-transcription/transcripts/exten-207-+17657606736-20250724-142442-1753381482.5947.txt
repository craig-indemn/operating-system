Sorry for your hold. This is Cody to help you. Hey Cody, it's Fabian. Hey Fabian, how are you? Pretty good. How you doing? Doing pretty good. That's good. That's good. Now I just had a quick question for you. I know I think on that paper you sent me. I think it says my payment due on the twenty seventh of this month. Okay. If I'm not mistaken, I was just going to see. Is there any way you can run it today? Yeah. Or do I have to wait for like the actual date? No, you don't ever have to wait. Give me just a second here, Fabian. You've been doing good, buddy. Yeah, man, we've been staying so busy right now. Well, busy is a good thing, man. Yeah, that's a good thing. Yeah, we need a from here. We got from here to December to take everything up. Yeah. It gets really bad for us up here. Probably gets slow around December, January, February, March up there. I imagine. January and February are like our worst month. Yeah, you're probably not doing too much up that way. No man, it's the weather. It's just so cold. Snow and snowdrifts and all kinds of crazy stuff. Yeah, it gets pretty cold up here. Yeah, that's one thing about being that far north. You kind of get. The worst months of working up there. Yeah, the worst. The worst quarter we've had was one year was like negative twenty five up here. Holy crap. So it was yeah it was it was bad. That's terrible. I believe we set your policies up on EFT, so they should automatically draft for you. Yeah, I I have the money in there. Um, and if it's due the twenty seventh, I just I really hate for another payment to come out. And that's how I just found like it. Let me double check here. Okay. If not, it's fine. I I just wait it out. I was just going to see if it was possible to to run it. But if if you can, it's okay. Yeah, I think they're going to auto draft in the next like three days. Just double check here. Yeah, so the you know I combine the billing accounts into one billing account. So you have a payment for nine. Looks like nine ninety three thirty seven. That's going to draft in the next two or three days or so. Two or three days. Yeah. Okay. So we don't have to do anything. So that you know we paid like the half you know. With this company, they don't set up the billing account as soon as we issue the policy for us to be able to make like the payment and everything. So we made it on the second of July. For each of the policies. And then so that was half of the the bill that was due. The bill. So nine ninety three thirty seven is going to draft, which is for both of your policies. Right around the twenty seventh, three days. And then the twenty seventh of August, September all the way through May of next year on the twenty seventh. So it's one. Yeah. Yeah, it's one payment for both policies since I combine those billing accounts and it's going to be right around the twenty seventh of every of every month. So yeah, we make it. We don't need to make a a manual payment. Okay. For these. Okay. Okay, okay. That sounds good, Cody. So I oh so you send them maybe the next three days or so. Yeah, so. The draft days the twenty seventh. That's a Sunday. It may be the twenty eighth. I mean, most of the time it's within a day or two of your draft day. So. Okay. It could be as late as Monday, I guess possibly Tuesday, but usually it's going to draft right on or within a day typically of your draft day. Okay. All right, Cody. No problem. If for some reason you don't see it by Monday or Tuesday, you know just just give me a call. We can take a look at it or whatever. Okay, you should be good to go from here on out. Yes, sir. Okay. All right, I appreciate it, man. Thank you. Yes, sir. No problem. Let me do something else. Okay. Yes, sir. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
