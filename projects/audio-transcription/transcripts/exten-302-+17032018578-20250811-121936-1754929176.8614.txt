Hello. Hello, is this Anna? I think. Yes, it is. Okay, yeah, my name is Joseph Vagagenny. I was calling to speak with Eddie Nunez. He was my agent, but they told him he's not with with you guys anymore. So, the person sent me over to you. Correct. Okay, so you want the policy number. This way. Okay, so it's two two four six four five. I'm so sorry. Dash. Can you get that one more time? I apologize. Yeah, yeah, two two four six four five dash three five eight eight eight six eight zero dash two five. What's the name on the account? It would be my name, Joseph Paul Vagagenny. Okay, this is for your commercial package as auto owners. Yeah, it's for my. I've got a late late property. It's not home. It's just property with a dock and boat. I got that pulled up. And so how can I help you? Okay, a couple of things. I'm working through a claim right now. Tree fell on the dock, so being kind of redone. But I've got a question. I got to call into my adjuster too. They had a demo part of it. You know, or you know, to do the work, and that was. So that that was itemized as a as a part of the work. I know my coverage was for fifty thousand. Okay, for the building, but I also see on the on the insurance there's a demolition limit also. Would that cover the demolition that had to be done? I'm not 100 sure on that. I would have to reach out to the adjuster. Yeah, and I left a message for Dalton Dalton Biggs. I've been working with him. And. Yeah, well, just yeah, I just left it just a couple hours ago, so hopefully you'll you'll respond. I was going to ask him about that because the cost is over fifty thousand and. So I wanted to see if you know demolition costs could be, you know, covered also because under the coverage that's what it says. So. I'll talk to him about that. But since I got you on the line, the other thing is now that I found out that it's going to. I mean, for me to replace that dock, if anything, and if it were to completely get destroyed, it would probably be about one hundred thousand dollars. So I'd like to increase the limit. On my policy to one hundred thousand dollars, and I and I thought that's what it was originally. But looks like that's not the case. Okay, so I'm looking at the. I'm looking at the property. It says property in the open. The limit was fifty thousand, but I know when I talked with Eddie, I told him, "Yeah, it's probably probably cost about a hundred because that's what I that's what the folks out there told me to replace it." Yeah, I thought that's what the limit was, but I guess it was set at fifty thousand. So. I think just to be safe, I want to see something happens in the future. I want to I want to get that up to to one hundred thousand. Okay. Gotcha. Okay, I can definitely send that request into the carrier to get that changed. Okay. Okay, and then you'll just send me an email or. Yeah, once they um, auto owners take a little bit a little bit for them to update the documents for us to be able to. To look at, so I'll send in the request today to get that bumped up, and once they do complete it, they'll let us know, and then I can forward that document over to you. Okay. Okay, and you have my email address, right? Correct. Yeah. Okay. Okay, and then I'll I'll just talk to Dalton about the the other stuff then. Yeah, just like it really depends on if they have a lot of reasons if it does qualify under or not. And I said I don't want to give you the wrong answer. Right, right. Okay, that sounds good. Okay. Well, then I'll just sit tight. Get back from you. I guess it'll be in an email then. Right, you said. Correct. Yeah, I'll send you an email once they get that completed. Okay, okay, that sounds good. Okay, and so you're going to be my agent going forward then, right? Correct, as long as it's on the commercial. Now, if it's for your personal income, like your personal lines, if you have any of those with us, it would be a different agent. Okay, I guess it's I don't I don't know if this is really commercial, but they have it coded as commercial package is the reason it was
