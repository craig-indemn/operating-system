Good afternoon. This is Renee. Hey Renee, it's Gary at Alliance. I don't I don't know how you got filed up on this, but the the homeowner's policy it was switched over to us apparently by signature on your part. On an agent of record change, but the auto for auto owners that you had was not done as an AOR. So the only thing that I'm going to be able to do for you is get you or get you a copy of your current coverage. And you will have to take that to the agent that you had with the auto owners and give that to them showing that you've got coverage and they should be able to backdate that policy for you. Okay, I talked to her this morning and she said she could only do 20 days. On on the auto. Backdated 20 days on the auto owners. Yeah. Yeah, see I I don't know for sure on that. I would think probably no more than 30 days. But even at that, if you do that, you're still not going to show a lapse on anything, even if that policy cancels. Because you've got the new one with us that went in effect on the 21st of November. It looks like. Right, it's just that the reason I switched is because it was so expensive and now I'm being charged 400 almost 500 dollars a month for. For two months, almost three months now with them, so I won't be able to recover that money. It's my problem. If if if all of if if both of the policies had been done by agent of record over to us, then we could have gotten that canceled for you at the time the new one was issued. But as I told you before, we don't normally unless it's an in house policy that we already have, then we don't have the authority to cancel those for you. I wonder why they told me they could. That's weird. Okay. Um. Well, I've already sent her a copy of the declaration page of the insurance. So um. I guess we'll just see what happens. But now I was told that the that the homeowner would not take effect until April. That you would not be able to take that until April this year. It's showing on it's showing on our system. That it has been transferred. Um. Let me just confirm that real quick for you. Yeah, we have that one on our system. That shows it was April the 14th. And then of course we've got the National General policy that was issued on November the 21st of last year. Okay. All right. Those are the two we have on record for you, but but I don't have any records of the old auto policy or the one that you've. Replaced in November. I don't have any records on that at all. Okay. All right, all right. Well, I appreciate your help. All right, thank you. Okay, thank you. Bye bye.
