Thanks, Heather. How can I help you? Hey, guys, man. I'm calling kind of over half my wife here. Just checking, she had a situation. We have Main Street America through you guys, and y'all are shopping and around for us right now. We didn't really lose it. Anyway, about a month ago, she was driving over on Highways Boulevard in Greensboro, by Target on that side street. And coming from Fresh Market on the side street, going straight and had a stop sign. A lady sitting on a stop sign pulled out and hit her, causing pretty extensive damage on the passenger side front door. And they took both their cars, pulled them around the block, and parked them. The lady immediately came out apologizing, her kids are crying. Lady was apologizing. They called 911, non emergency. Police officer came and the police officer showed up and started getting the story. She denied hitting my wife. She's what I'm talking about anyway. He did a report. I think he says my wife. I talked to the officer since he said she did get a ticket for. You know, procedure failure to proceed with caution or something like that. There are no witnesses. I know there was people behind, but you know they when they pulled their cars around they left. Anyway, bottom line is she has Progressive. And they're denying to pay for it because she says it's her word against my wife. I don't know if you had any advice. We're going to talk. Is up with my wife. I told the police officer once. He told her that they would usually. I don't know how it works. I mean, is it because it was literally he wasn't there to witness it or what? The my wife's car was damaged on the front, you know, very bad. It was banged in. The whole passenger side front door was pushed in, and she had damage to her front corner where she was pulling out. I don't know if you have any advice. I'm just calling the safe. We have Main Street America through you guys. Right. I'm sorry that was a lot of information. I apologize. No, you're fine. So Ralph Kitley, right? Yes, Ralph and my wife for Redd. She's right beside me. Okay. So I would say, do we have information for the other person's insurance? We do. The Progressive. It's nothing that's kind of you know we called y'all right away at Main Street America and they told us just to talk to Progressive and they would deal with Progressive. So Redd told we told she called Progressive three at least two or three times in the meantime and they. They said that the message today said it was her word against their their her word against my wife's word and the reason they said it was their police report where there was a police report we got the copy of it. It was an event number or whatever it got in anyway. To answer your question, Progressive. Okay. So she says the lady like she says the immediately got out and apologizing for for dehitting her, but then she called her husband and then soon she told her husband she started denying it. And you guys have pictures as well of the vehicles. I don't think she got. You don't need pictures. Did you? I don't forget a picture. He was looking around at stuff. I thought he he saw the day in his report, whatever kind of reporter was. He said that he talked about the damage to both vehicles. Okay, so I mean we can file this on your auto policy. Because I mean usually we would want to go through the at fault party, but if they're saying that it's basically 50 50 like you take care of yours. And you know the other party takes care of theirs, then there's nothing really that we can do but file a claim on your policy. Yeah, I don't understand. How can I? I mean, my gosh, I just you know my car got side slaps at Walbard, a hit and run. I had to you know pay for that myself. Because I want my premiums to go up. How can it be when the person just filed lies and the police officers there? I just don't get that. Yeah, I mean Progressive is saying that they're you know that it's basically a 50 50. Your word against their word. Yeah, I mean I'm not sure that there's a lot that we can do besides filing it on your own. I can get Tracy. Let me see if Tracy's on the phone. Because she might be able to, she's usually the one that has more insight on some of these claim situations. I'll tell you what. I'm getting ready to go traveling up to Christiansburg, Virginia. I'm going to be in a bad spot here. Can I
