Thank you so much for calling Alliance Insurance. Hey, this is Cassandra Bennett. I wanted to pay my insurance, please. Sure. One second, I'll pull up your information, please. Looks like it's National General. Yeah. Second. Let me just pull it up here. See if we have a credit card number for you, and where we can process the payment. Hey. One hundred and eighty dollars and forty cents is the amount in a credit card. Thirty eight seventy nine. Do you want to use this? That is it. Perfect. One second more, and we're almost done. Just waiting for the confirmation. Perfect. The payment was successfully. You will get an email from National General letting you know that the payment is processed, and I'll put it here in our records that the payment was taken. Okay. Anything else I can help you with? That is it. Happy holiday. Thank you.
