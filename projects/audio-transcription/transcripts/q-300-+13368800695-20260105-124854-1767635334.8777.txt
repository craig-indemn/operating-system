Thanks for holding, Miss Gary. Yes, hi Gary. My name is Rhonda Murphy. Uh huh. And I have insurance with Alliance Well Progressive. Uh huh. And I recently I had three vehicles insured, but I took the I had to take the insurance off of the Jaguar because the engine blew in it. Okay. And they had me with a six month premium of six hundred and ninety nine dollars and fifty cents. But when I subtract the amount that I was being charged for the jag, it came up to be. Put it down somewhere. Four hundred and seventy nine dollars for the six months, but the lady just told me that it's five hundred and forty two dollars and twenty cents, and I was just trying to figure out what the difference was, what was going on with it. Well now if you if you took the car off in the middle of the of the term. No. I just took it off last week and they gave me a. No, no, it wasn't. It well the renewal is coming up to fourteenth of this month. I took it off and they gave me a ten dollar and seventy some cent credit to my my bank account. Yeah, a pro rated amount that's correct. Yeah, so this jag is not going to be insured on January the fourteenth. Right. So I deducted what they were saying it will cost me to insure two hundred and fifty four dollars. Okay. So I subtracted that from the six ninety nine fifty, and I'm pretty sure that it came up to be four hundred and seventy nine dollars. But then I was told that I owe five hundred and forty two dollars and twenty cents for my renewal. Let me see here. Let me get it pulled up here. Now how many cars did you have on there before that Miss Murphy? It was three. Three cars and now you just have two, right? Correct. Okay, so you lose some multi car discounts as well. Because the more vehicles you have on there, the less expensive the insurance is. Well, I'm just going to try to pull it up here and see if I can get some current numbers for you. Did you speak to somebody today? Yes, she actually transferred me to you. Okay. Okay. I can give you the policy number if you need it. Yeah, I've got the policy number here. I just have to get in into the right. Right place here. Spare with me just a minute. Okay. To make sure we're on the on the right page here. One fourteen. Yeah, the premium that I'm showing for the renewal on the fourteenth is five hundred and forty seven dollars and sixty cents. Now the only the only thing I can do is to try to explain to you. I know in October that the state took some increases again, and you would not see those until your renewal this month. That along with the the pro rated amount of coming that car coming off and losing your discounts from having three on there instead of two. Is probably why your rate is not what you're calculating it at. Now I can give you some individual numbers if you'd like. Well, that's not what she told me. She said five forty two and you just said five forty seven. Five forty. I'm showing five forty seven sixty, but that may not include any of the money that they gave back to you. Well, she just told me five forty two twenty. Coming up, guess between the transfer of the car. I'm showing the total policy premium at five forty seven sixty. So I don't know where the five dollar difference comes in. Let's see. Do you have something to write some numbers down with? I'll write them as you talk. Okay. On the Jeep Wrangler, I'm looking at a vehicle premium of one sixty four twenty three. One sixty four, where it was one sixty four twenty three cents. Yes, man. One forty four. Okay. And on the Honda truck, I'm looking at two eighty three thirty seven. I'll call it the two thirty five. Correct. I don't get any discounts at all about being two vehicles. Well, you do get discounts for having two, but you lose some when you took that third one off there. Well, I can't do it because the motor blew up in it. So I just can't because the motor blew up. Okay. Well, if you take it off the coverage, if you take it off your policy, you do. And then you've got. Let's see the uninsured motorists and uninsured motorists on here. So how much is that? Eighty five dollars. Yeah, that stayed the same. And that's all of the individual information on here. Is that you? The work is done. Do you pay by the month or do you pay it? No, I normally pay it in full. Okay, that's where the five forty two comes in. Because if you pay it in full, it's five forty
