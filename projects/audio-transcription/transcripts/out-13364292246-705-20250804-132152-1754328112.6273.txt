Correct. Okay, when did you purchase that? Because I don't have that property. March of twenty three is that the one that Terry Hawk is holding? I don't know what all he's holding. I don't know. Well, I remember like you took you got all my insurance at Case, which is a totally separate. Yeah, yeah. LLC. So yeah, we took the the mortgage started in March of twenty three. Yeah, so Jean owned that building, right? Was it Jean's building? Okay, maybe I'm. He don't sell anything. Yeah, no kidding. Misremembered. So only thing we have right now for for me custom made Katy Co is Workers Comp. I do remember you left something with. Terry's office. I just don't remember what all that something is. That would be it. Whatever. Yeah. So if if that's it, I I can do two things for you. You go you go over there with him and adjust that if you want. Okay, good. So I can cancel the Workers Comp because you're not going to have any employees under Katy Co. No, no, no, no, no, not yet. But you you tell me when and we can get rid of that. Yeah. Policy for nineteen hundred bucks a year. You'll do an audit when we cancel, but we can cancel that one and then on this one now. I just need some information. Of do you have any idea and I'll pull a tax card. Do you have any idea year built or any updates at all to the property since? It's on the tax card, my friend. Say it one more time. That stuff is on the tax card. Yeah, I'm gonna pull. I'm gonna pull the tax card. All the updates HVAC plumbing twenty nineteen. About roof. Before then, but I don't know when, but it's in good shape. I've looked at. I've had to look at. I don't know, just making. I sorry, that's probably not the right answer. No, we're going to estimate. Yeah, we're going to make the twenty fifteen. I don't know. Is it rubber roof? Do you know what kind of is? I think so. Yeah. I pull. It's not shingled. I pull some pictures. I'm pretty sure it's rubber. Like when I looked at it with Jean, he looked at it with me, or I looked at it with an inspector looking at something else, and he said, "That's what you want." So whatever high quality commercial roofing is, he said, "That's what you want." Any any other operation besides me customing the whole building? Is there anything any other use for the building? Not at the moment, no. Okay. And time soon. Okay, all right. I'm on it. Thanks. Yeah, appreciate.
