See you, question. Hello. What's up, Joe Joe? Hello. What's happening? You are my man. We don't. Wide open. What you doing? Yeah, man, just trying to follow up on some emails and clarify, get some dates on the calendar. You sent me an email from Fowler about lunch. Is that something you want to try to participate in? You want me to coordinate that with some other teammates? What do you want to do there? Yeah, I just hadn't slowed down long enough to respond to you. I saw you text this morning. I don't normally have appointments on Mondays, but I've had a couple. Oh, I forgot the gentleman's name, Daniel maybe. Anyway. Yeah, he reached out new rep. I don't know if you saw that rep. New rep wanted to come in about construction side of things and meet with me, which I don't think is anything particular to me, but. No, I think it's just more about getting to know the guy. What I love to do, Joe. Yeah. Maybe coordinate with you and hopefully fix and let him come and talk to you. I mean, you guys are doing the construction business around here, and Chase doesn't really do much of that, neither does anybody else. So. Yeah, the only reason why I'm trying to pivot, Aprio, the accounting folks up in Malary. As for a follow up meeting with us, networking, bonding that kind of stuff, trying to be a resource partner on the same day. Yeah. Otherwise, I wouldn't ask you to. I wouldn't ask you to take it off my plate, but if we can, if we can reschedule, I'll be glad to reschedule with the gym. I don't know what what is calendar looks like, but get it all included. I wouldn't mind that at all, but I missed a you know Aprio up in Malary at all. Barely. I know the name. That's about it. Yeah, I missed the last appointment we had with Christopher and Jeff, and it's about bonds and you know referral partnerships and. I don't want to miss another one. But yeah, let me reach out to Daniel just tell him hey man, if we can pivot maybe we can bring more more. You know team members to the table if that's all right with him, and if not, if if not plan B I guess would. Would be okay. Well, let's let's see if Rick can fix can fix can meet with. Well, that's a Monday. I'm just I'm gonna see if he can maybe if he can pivot to Tuesday the following day. And you know, see what he says. So let me let me just send him that note. How about the 21st? Would you that's Tuesday? Can you can you know what your calendar now is like? You need to look and see. Let me look right quick. That morning, that morning, the best I could do, we got a red book account review that afternoon, Jeff and I do. Yeah. That after. All right. Well, that's not going to work for you then. One about the 22nd. Just the 21st would hang on. I'm gonna pull over. Hang on. Yeah, the 20. Let's see here. The same thing. Another policy review. Sit down with the guy. That's that big a big multi million dollar house we just did. Yeah. 16 million dollar house after the 22nd. Well, let me let me see. Yeah. Or 23rd is a man. They don't and I don't now it doesn't work for me. Oh, that's right. Never mind. All right. Well, look, I'm I'm gonna send him an email. I'm gonna tell him that that look and we can find some people that you guys can take to lunch, but that that your schedule is not going to let it work with Joe Jessup this morning. And and I can I can invite Fix, you know I just like to have at least one producer there that was actually sending in some construction submissions that you know that these guys want to talk to. And I can't tell if it's Daniel and you Travis and any other guys that want to come as well. It looks like it was just Daniel Greer. If he wants to bring his whole team in here, we need to probably you know a little more a little more time to coordinate that. So let me let me talk to Daniel. I'll figure out what it is he wants to do. I'll keep you on the loop just so you know. But otherwise, I think just let me see if I can handle it and let him come and get his agency visit quota out of the way if that's what he's trying to do. Okay, that's fine
