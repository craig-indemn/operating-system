Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Hi Brandy, this is Ingrid Medlock. I am trying to add a new car to my car insurance. Wanted to get a quote from you. Of course, I want to take one the old vehicle off and put the new car on. Okay, have you already purchased the vehicle? It's going to be officially purchased this evening. I have the VIN. I have the VIN number and everything if you need it. Okay, and which vehicle will you be trading in? The Mercedes. Okay, and what's the new the VIN number to the new vehicle? Five Y J three E as an Edward one E. A O T is in Tom F one two one four seven six. Can you repeat that VIN number to me one more time? The number five, Y as in yellow J John three Edward one Edward Apple. Onion Thomas Frank one two one four seven six. Okay, is this possibly a Tesla? Another Tesla model Y. Model three. Model three. Okay. Is it a newer one? Yeah, I guess so. Okay, my system's not liking the VIN number. Okay, hang on. I'm texting now to see if the number is correct. I think that O is actually a zero. Oh. I do know that, but I'm not sure about the rest of them because it it brought it up as a possibility and then whenever I clicked on it it gave me nothing. Maybe it isn't O. You want me to say it again? Yes, please. Okay, five yellow John three E one Edward Apple zero Thomas Frank one two one four seven six. Five Y J three E one E A zero T F one two one four seven six. Okay. I think that one's it, and that O is actually a zero. It's not giving me the year, but it is saying Tesla model three. Okay. Um, do you know the year of the vehicle? Trying to find out now. Okay. Bye. All right, it's a twenty twenty six. That's why. That's why I asked if it was new because some of the VIN number is not in the system yet. All right, and will you be financing this vehicle? Yes. Do you know who it's going to be through yet? Hang on a second. Yeah. And then it looks like on your current coverage you have comprehensive at a hundred dollar deductible collision at five hundred and towing at a hundred dollars reimbursement. Are you wanting the same exact coverage on the new Tesla? Exact coverage and it's leased through JP Morgan Chase. Okay. All right, so by taking off the 2016 Mercedes and added on a 2026 Tesla model with the same exact coverage. This will increase your premium roughly around 426 dollars from now until the end of your term, which will be April. And if you're paying monthly, that'll just be divided by however many payments you have left. Can you give me that amount? I won't know that amount until billing is updated. Oh okay. That takes about since it's Friday. I would say by Tuesday it might be updated. But I can add it today if I pick up the vehicle today, right? Yeah, so I've what I've done is taken off the 2016 Mercedes and added on the Tesla. Got it. I'll be able to give you proof of insurance sent to your email address. That way, just in case they need it. Yes, I need that. Okay. Um. Are you sending that mail? Yes, after I type it all up, I'll send it over. Got it. Thank you so much. I appreciate you both. You said it increased a 400 and that'll be spread across my payments, but right. Correct. Yes, if you're paying monthly, yeah. You're not saying an increase of 400 dollars a month. Got it. Okay. No, no, no, no, no. That's girl. If you're if you're paying like. No, if you're paying monthly, that 400 dollars will be divided in how many months you have left in your policy. So if you've already made a payment this month, you cannot well you'll have to count this month, but that'll be towards next month. So your next month bill might be a little bit higher than usual. Thank you. If you've already paid this month. Okay. All right, sounds good. Thank you so much. Yes, you're welcome. If you have any other questions, just let us know. Okay. We'll do. Thank you so much. Take care. Thanks and you do the same. Okay. Bye bye.
