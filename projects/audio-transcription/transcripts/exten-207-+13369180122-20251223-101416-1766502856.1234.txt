Hey brother, what's going on, man? How you doing? Good, good. So, from Spain this morning. I hear that. Yeah, let's go ahead and get this thing set up and paid for. All right, and you're going to do this monthly EFT. Yeah, I'm just set it and hit my credit card this month. Okay. You said you want to use a credit card instead of a checking account. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I don't think that that will be an issue for some reason. It is. I'll let you know. But do you what bank is it with? My credit card is Capital One. Capital One. Okay. Yeah. Forgot it's credit not debit. And what is the card number? Five one five six seven six nine zero nine three one nine five eight one seven. All right, that was five one five six seven six nine zero nine three one nine five eight one seven. Correct. And the expiration date. Eleven point six. Three digit code on the back. Zero eight one. Zero eight one. Yes. And zip code. The card. Is the. Two seven one two seven. Okay. All right, and we're getting this issued effective the 30th, right? That's when your other policy. Expires. Yeah, do it for the 29th. 29. Yeah, because I'm going to call them Monday morning and cancel it. Okay. All right, we will do that. If for some reason you get a, you know, little DMV letter or whatever because you switched insurance, or sometimes Progressive will obviously notify the DMV that your policy is canceled. So, if they haven't received the new documentation yet, then they'll think that you had a lapse and they'll send you a letter in the mail. So, for some reason you get one of those, just let us know we can send in the FS1 form that they need just to show that you haven't had a lapse. Okay. That happens pretty frequently with switching insurance with the state. So you may not you may not get one, but just in case, just just let me know and we can get that form sent over to the to the state for you. All right. Y'all, so y'all aren't going to be open Friday. We are open Friday. Yeah, we're closed tomorrow and Thursday, and then we're open Friday. Okay. Well, how about Friday? Just go ahead and set all that stuff in motion on Friday. Just that way. Yeah, third. No, this is coming Friday. They have the Christmas. Right, right, right. Yeah, go ahead and do that. That way, when I call them Monday, at least I'll have the insurance. So already everything'll be good to go. Not like to worry about anything. That lapse over or whatnot. Okay. Yeah, we will. I'll have it issued on Friday then, believe. All right. And I'll do it effective on the 29th. All right, cool. That sounds good. All right, buddy. I appreciate it, buddy. We can. I'll work that out. Yes, sir. Thank you very much. I appreciate it too. No problem. Let me know once we get everything issued. We'll email you the the ID cards for your vehicles and everything, and should be good to go, brother. All right, good deal, man. Thank you again. Yes, sir. All right. Bye.
