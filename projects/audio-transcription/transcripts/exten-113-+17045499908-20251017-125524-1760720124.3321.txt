Thanks for holding, Miss Gary. Hi Gary, this is Ellie from Auto Owners. Ellie, how are you? I'm good, but I'm having some trouble. Okay. Um, so I'm trying to key the address change for that cancellation that we discussed for Reagan Mitchell. And our backend system won't allow me to update the country. But I did go in and look, and I think on your end there is well I found a way on your end to update the address or update the country and change the mailing address. Okay. So I don't now that the farthest back that we can go is the 1010. I can help you if you just want to go ahead and key the cancellation on your end so that you're able to update the mailing address. Okay, now do I do I do it as a as processing the cancellation and the address at the same time is that correct? Yes. Okay. And I can walk you through it right now if you'd like. Just to make sure it's all correct. Okay, I am in the policy and I'm assuming that this policy proposal this policy change proposal is that the one you put in today. Potentially, but I didn't really make any changes to it, so I don't know if it's best to just like start over because I kind of just resumed in to see if it was possible. Just delete it right. Okay. Yeah. And then just we'll just start from the beginning. Okay. And now on the initial transaction, do I put cancellation or do I put name and address change? I would put cancellation. Okay. And before we submit it, we'll make sure that it allows you to to change that. Give on the tent. Yes. Okay. And then does it bring you into the initial? Um, propose like like a normal policy change screen. Can you go to the policy tab? Um, it took me when I click cancel. It took me straight to the cancellation portion and ask, of course, what type of cancellation and the explanation of cancellation. So it doesn't. Sorry, I'm just not familiar with, but it looks like specifically on your end. It did not take it did not take me straight into the screen that had the policy tabs on there. Okay. Okay, well then. I think we won't be able to key a cancellation. Then we'll just have to key initially a policy change and then either you or I can go and on the same 1010 date. I think key a cancellation once this initial mailing address is processed. Okay, so I'm going to go back and change that to change the name and address. Yes, sorry about that. That's okay. Okay, now when I did that, it pulled me into the policy and account holder information with that current address on there. So I just want to go ahead and continue, right? Yes, it should. I want it to get you to like a policy screen where with the normal tabs as if you were quoting a proposal. Does it look like that right now? Well, there's there's tabs out here, but it gives me the policy and billing information. It it doesn't it doesn't do anything else. It's just taking me through the individual names to change the the actual name or address on here. Let's see. Because if I'm just when I go to the page and I was just in the inquire screen, it looks like to me like I can see up at the top it says policy locations, additional coverages as if it normally does for any other like policy change. So it's taking is it taking you automatically to the end like summary billing screen? It did. It's taking me. It took me to number one the current address information and the current name information. And then it's taking me in now to change that name and address. So that should be good. Okay, and is it allowing you? It did get yeah it did it took the it took the Canadian address as well. Woo. Okay. Well that's good. Um. Okay, so. See. Yeah, I guess we'll make sure that you can submit it and make sure everything okay. Yeah, let me go ahead and let me go ahead and put this on here first. But it did let me put the Canadian. Okay. Address in there. Now it asks me for agent remarks. Do I need to put anything in there? You could just say moved. Okay. This is this is amazing to me. Just that it's working or. Well, I mean, just that it's it's such an ordeal to get. Oh, yeah. Because you would think, I mean, I guess people don't typically move out of the country. So like I would have been able if it was within the United States, I would have been able to key the cancellation and change the address. But our system just doesn't allow us to change the country, so
