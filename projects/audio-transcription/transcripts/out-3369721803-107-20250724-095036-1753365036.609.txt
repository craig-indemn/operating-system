Hey Nancy, it's Cecilio at Alliance Insurance. Um, giving you a call about that bill you received from travelers. Um, it is something that is due to them due to all the changes that were made, back in May, um, in June and some like recently this year, prior to us canceling the policy, and then your draft date being, um, just about two weeks after your, due date and a couple of days right before the cancellation. So again, it is a bill that's outstanding. So if you have any questions about that, just give me a call, and I will explain further. Thanks much. Have a good day.
