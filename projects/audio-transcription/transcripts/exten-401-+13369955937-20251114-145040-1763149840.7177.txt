Hello, this is Heather. Hello, Heather, how's it going? This is Francisco. Hey, Francisco, how's it going? Pretty good. I have a Kuwait question. So my current car that we drive the most is Honda. It's I'm trying to get another car. So I'm in the process of looking. But I was wondering how if I bought a I know they have those I just want something for. Eight or being nothing big sense or anything, but I was looking if I buy I said with a salvage title. If there's any anything then it should be other than that just a regular liability will will be okay just to put insurance or. Is that something that it will work for me? That's my insurance. Um, right. I mean again, so you're looking to purchase another vehicle. Yes. Yes. Okay. So and I'm just looking into options whether it will be a used one or I looking into those salvage without the rebuild title. Oh, salvage title. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So. Let me pull your policy up. Oh, how do we have you insured through currently? I think it's a progressive for the cars and then. Yeah, that's right. Hold on one second. Yeah, I think progressive. Um, they might take a salvage title, but it would be only liability. Yeah, yeah, I don't want that then. Yeah, yeah, that I know that that's something that just one just like only use that's just. A car just to do the most because. Yeah. I usually use a Honda which is right now. It's in my. Yeah, it's progressive and it's a salvage. Um, they will you can add it on your policy, but I think they're just going to write it with liability coverage. Okay. Right. Yeah, yeah, I just wonder on that one. I just wanted what's a. What are my options on those? Just because you know I don't want to buy something that means I will. We can because I know some some insurance has some policy too. They do. Yeah. And also I don't want to do a full coverage. Their requirements are all different. So yeah, and if that was the case, though we do have some other other carriers, I think like National General. You could write. Um. I think you can put full coverage on those. Oh, that will be just just a liability. That will be just a more. Be fine with progressive. Yeah. All right, she just want to know that and then once I get it, I just give the call. How do I do about? Yeah. You do what? This weekend. Oh no, we still under when it works. And you hear me? Anything can happen. So the easiest way and the quickest way is to email support. Okay. And their email is is just like mine, but it's support instead of my name, Heather F. It's going to be support at myallianceinsurance dot com. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Just email them the information with the car. Yes. Yep. Okay. Yeah, and and but that goes straight to our support team. So it's support at myallianceinsurance dot com. You can also go on our website and submit it that way too, like Alliance's website.

Uh, something more a certified car. It will do the same thing or. If I if I bought a like a certified car, they don't want a full coverage on it. Will that be the same process? So. Yeah, absolutely. Anything we need to make it make it change. That's the easiest way and quickest way. Okay. All right. Yeah. Yep, and you could do that like I said. If it's after hours, you can submit that anytime.

Let's see what your coverages are. Um, the 15 Traverse's full coverage. Okay. And the two. The Renco is full coverage. And all the two just liability. Liability only on the other two. Yeah. And not comprehensive. Do they they go together with the full coverage? That's how spoiled. Or if I want to
