Great afternoon, Alliance Insurance. This is Jamie. Hello, Jamie. Howdy. I'm doing okay. How about yourself? I'm fine. I was calling because my name is Jacqui Watson and my son Darian Watson, which is 16 at the time. Now he took the driver's ed at her school, he passed that, then went and took the written test, he passed that, but he's not driving yet. So I received a letter saying I need to call and speak to someone. I was speaking to Heather, but I didn't have his number on his permit. I got the number now, so she just said just to put his name down. It won't change like the price of what I'm paying. It's just just something that I will need to do. So I was calling to see if I can give you the number. Yeah, let me let me distribute. Well, look here for you, Jacqui. My phone system pulled me into Jacqui Watson, 1641 Charity Lane in Winston Salem. And I do see an auto policy with Progressive. It does reflect that same mailing address there. Let's see. Okay, so I've got you and Woodrow Davis as drivers. Auto policy with a 2020 GMC Terrain. Okay, so unpacking all this. You said you got a notice to report son's information. Did that come from Progressive or did it come from us? It came from Alliance Insurance. Yeah, it came from Alliance. They said I need to call, but like I said, he's not driving. He don't have his driver's license or anything. He just passed and passed that. Okay, so and and how old is he right now? He's he's only 15. He's 15 or 16. Yes. 15. 15. Okay, so let's see what I will do here to do this. What's your son's first name? Darian Watson. You spell that for me. D E R E O N. What's his middle initial? L. Okay, and I just want to double check, but D E R E O N. Yes, it's a first name. I don't know you need to put that in. D E up a limit, just a okay. So D E apostrophe R E O N. Yes. Okay. What's his date of birth? 1117 2009. I'm sorry, Miss Watson. The phone's breaking up. You said 1117 2009. Yes. Okay. Okay. Bear with me here while this system thinks. Okay, yep, all right. So what I've done here, Miss Watson, is just put in Darian's information as a household member. On the policy, it doesn't show me any kind of premium change to do this. I am going to submit it for you. Does he plan on getting his driver's license? Yeah, I mean he's going to go take the test, but I mean not soon when I'm able to get him a car because he ain't driving my car. So he said that he needed his permit number. Well, to list him. So yes and no. Okay, so so what I've done right now is just list him on your auto policy as a household member. He's not a rated driver. Okay, so basically meaning he's not driving, he's not covered in an accident. Right now, at some point in time, if he goes to get his driver's license, he will have to be changed from a household member to a rated driver on your auto policy. And then there'll be a new declarations page that will show that information. He would take that with him to the DMV and then once he passes the road test, he would get a driver's license and then life moves on. The touchy part about this though is that changing in from a household member to a rated driver. That's when the policy uprates and print. That's when parents freak out because the money gets expensive. Kids. So I don't necessarily need his permit number right now to do this. And let me just submit it for you. Make sure it saves it. But I would say yeah, he didn't he did save it there. And now he shows up as. Let me just refresh this. He should show up as yeah. So he shows as a list only driver right now on the policy. He can stay that way until he goes to get his driver's license. At that point in time, I'll need his permit number in order to change because that permit number will actually turn into his driver's license number. If you want to give it to me now, I can save it in the system for him. Otherwise, I would say leave it alone and I'll note this. I mean, if you need it
