Thank you for holding. It's just Tracy. How can I help you? Hello. I want to cancel my home insurance. Okay, what's your name? Miguel Molina. Okay, bear with me just a moment. And did you sell your home or did you did you get coverage elsewhere? No. We will change the company. I'm sorry, I'm Esther Cortez. I am the Polisacu. I am on the Polisacu account too. Okay, let me just pull this up here. We find you know other other company with with more cheaper price so that that is the reason because the price going out more than we expect so. Okay, so you were able to place coverage elsewhere. Is that correct? Yes. Okay, bear with me one second. What is your address? Twenty-four, twenty-five, Cedar Springs Way. Here in Winston, it's called twenty-seven, one twenty-seven. Excuse me. Oh, brilliant. Okay, I found it right here. Do you know the effective date of your new policy? Where we just have to call and pay, but they they ask for first we have to cancel with this we do, but we know we have to. To the end of September to finish the Polisacu, so that is that is the only we want to keep because the Polisacu end in September 30. Looks like your current policy will end on September 21st. With that, that doesn't make sense. That that doesn't make sense because you know we buy the house and September 30. And we pay we pay for a year, so that means we have a week less of the year or what? How that work? And right now, the policy. If well, let me look and see if the premium's been paid. Give me one moment, please. Okay. Okay, I don't see it's been paid, so. The policy will still renew, but if we cancel it on the 30th, you will owe premium up to that date of cancellation. Oh, you know what? It looks like you're on an auto pay. Oh, it's an auto pay. I was thinking you the you the car was an auto pay. Yeah, no, that the house is an auto pay too. Yeah, the house and the car were on auto pay because the car is. No, that one's canceled. Yes, I would take the house out and you keep the car. Okay, we'll take care of that one. Okay, there may be time. It's due to draft on the 26th. So I'll have to see if I can get that stopped if there's enough time. But what we need to do is know what day the new policy is effective so we don't create a lapse in your coverage. Okay, okay, so the the the payment is for a month or for a year. The payment the auto pay for how? For a year. No, okay, no, no. I want to cancel. Okay, um, can you reach out to the other agent and see what day they're starting the new policy? So that we know what day to stop this one. Otherwise, you could have a lapse in coverage if they don't get it done. Yeah, the the new policy. We we we will call right now after after we finish with you. Okay, to to activate the new one. Okay, so what day do you want to cancel this one? Well, tomorrow. Excuse me. Excuse me, man. Uh huh. We already paid for one year last year in September, right? Correct. It the policy renews on Sunday. Listen, when it's the last day when the we got ready paid. We would want to do it on Sunday at 12:01 a.m. This Sunday. Yes, at the Sunday. No, we got ready. We pay for one year. Correct. It was active on September 21st. 365 days. How how how can how that work for you when I when I pay for one year one year is 365 and 65 days right? Correct, but the policy was effective as of September 21st. It looks like it's been September 21st for. But I buy the house on September the 30. Why my Polisacu is over on 21? If I pay for one year. Because it's not unusual that the lender wants verification of insurance immediately before closing. So it would have probably been activated on the 21st instead of the 30th, or your closing would have been postponed. Okay, let's let's that over on Sunday. You say Sunday. One. Twelve. Yeah, it'd be Sunday morning at 12:01 a.m. Would be the date we would need to cancel it, and
