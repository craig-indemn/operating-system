Hello, thank you for calling Progressive. Your call may be recorded or monitored. You can speak to me in complete sentences. Síquiera hablar en español solo diga español. Are you calling about service on an existing policy, help with a quote, reporting or checking on a claim, or if something else, please tell me what you need. Existing policy. Including any letters, please say or enter the customer's policy number. I have that as eight six five six six four four seven six. Is that right? Yes. Great, I found that policy. Thank you for being a Platinum agent. Please hold while I get you to someone to assist you. So my name is Debbie. How can I assist you? Hey Debbie, you have that policy up for Donald O'Neill. This is the agent Corbin Dukes calling. I issued this policy the other day. Six two three seven eight. Excellent. Go ahead. So you issued it the other day. Keep going. And I put the wrong. Apparently, had the wrong email address, so I just fixed it. But it looked like he got knocked out of um. Paperless or whatever. I just don't want him to get charged anymore. Do I? How do I fix it? Do I do an endorsement? Oh hang on, let's um. Okay, so invalid email. So let me send him another um email so that he can go ahead and um sign up for it. Okay. So that's um. So it's um Don D O N at M E Z G E R I N C dot com. Yeah, I had an N in there instead of an M. It's a Mary. So I fixed it. I talked to him about it too. I told him to be on the lookout for emails to his phone. I just want to get that five dollars off if I can before the seventeenth. Yeah, he just needs to agree to the terms for paperless. That's all. Okay. I've sent some an email to him. So is there anything else that I can assist with? That'll do it. Thank you for your help. No, you are very welcome. Thank you very much for writing with Progressive, and you have a wonderful weekend. To you. Bye bye now. Thanks.
