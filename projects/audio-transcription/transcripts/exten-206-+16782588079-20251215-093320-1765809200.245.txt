Hello, this Jeff Edmonds. Can I help you? Hey, Jeff, it's Barbara Green. How are you doing? Well, hello, Barbara. I'm doing fine. How are you doing? Oh, it's a beautiful cold, cold, cold Monday. How cold and where are you? I am in Gainesville, Georgia. I think it's like 20 degrees right now. I don't know. We were 14, 14 here in Surrey County, North Carolina, and warmer days are coming. That's all we can say. So. Well, I'm getting on a boat on Saturday. I'm gonna be in the Bahamas. Christmas time. Or you're gonna be. It's supposed to be 80s in Yorks County. That's all I know. Wow, well that's awesome. Where did you say you were in Georgia? Gainesville, about an hour north of Atlanta. I know you're up near Lake Lanier. Is that correct? We live on Lake Lanier. Do you really? Well, I have a son who did some rowing in college, and we had a couple of he had a couple of regattas at Lake Lanier where they hosted the Olympics and very familiar with where you are so. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hey, I'm giving you all on this. You know, I. I always want last looks. You give me last looks and I can make something happen. Okay. Well, we do not want to move it, so I'm going to go ahead and get rid of any leverage I might have had with you. All we want to do we we got an offer from a prior carrier of this insured who is aggressively trying to get it back, and we're looking at you guys got in great position last year to get this business new. Yeah. We would like, if at all possible, to get it to the neighborhood of where the the I guess the new quote came in. I don't know what you're capable of doing. The customer. Well, right now I'm at 25 credit credit, but I can go 30, 35 percent. I can take 10 off that rate. Well, I think if we can do that, then that will end all discussion for renewal, and we will have done right by the customer and. Yeah. I think if you can do that, we won't have anything else to ask, and I think we'll be in good shape. All right, so so changing that requires an endorsement, and I'm going to send it up, but it's it's going to take a minute. Don't make me lie. Because you know this is on PSR and all that, so I'm not really worried about premium. You know, I know we're worried about rates. Rate is what we're looking at, and and you're right, she she and she's I think she's comfortable with the setup. It took a couple months to get them going, but I don't want move them again. And any sort of relief you guys can give would be greatly appreciated. All right. Well, I'm going to keep you on the phone while I send it processing. Yeah, that. Just make sure we all on the same page, and my memory sucks sometimes and. Same here. So. So what part of North Carolina are you in? I'm in northwest North Carolina. We're about 30 miles northwest of Winston Salem, our county. Virginia, we are straight up I-77 from. You know, to get to where you are, we would we go 77 south to 85 and then. Oh, okay. At those exits for Gainesville and. Yeah, close towns. Nearby. You're actually more in the city of. If you came on out, 53 because you should be getting off at 53 or close to it. Yep. If you get out, I'm like in a first size county. You just got to go one county up. Okay. Well, when I went to his regattas, I stayed at a Ramada Inn in Gainesville. If I'm not mistaken, and then you know it's a nice little town there. I enjoyed it and then we drove maybe. It is. 10, 12 minutes out to Lake Lanier and froze our butts off then because I think both of the regattas they had for the colleges were in early March. Yeah, about like it is. Well, I don't know if it's as bad as it is this morning, but it was quite chilly. Both years we went there. So. All right, so I am changing the schedule module minus 35 percent, which is a point six five. Okay. Now because it's at minus 25 percent right now. Okay. And let me send this on up
