Thank you for holding. This is Donna. How can I help you? Um, this is Colley Baird. How are you? Good. How are you? Um, just need to let you know. Obviously, two notices that evidently the payment did not go through when I gave you the number of our routing number and our account number with through State Employees Credit Union, and I never knew that didn't go through. So I just been on the phone with them this morning and evidently the wrong account number was given to them, but I had you repeat it. So I don't understand what happened, but I've gone ahead and paid that this morning. Okay. And they did they did receive the check, and the bank had. Evidently the bank had put a stop on that. That was long after I don't know where that was, but in any event I told her I put a stop payment on that and we did we did the account number and the routing number. And so I don't know what happened there either, but in any event I just got it paid with them this morning. Gotcha. Okay, that's weird because remember I emailed you a confirmation that they that the payment went through. Well, I need somebody to double check this because now this is going to bounce our account. So I need to make. I'm going to have Brock call the bank this morning. They put a stop payment on the check and I know they did that. But I just made now another payment. Okay. Let me double check. Give me one second. Let me look online. Okay, and and like I said, I got a confirmation number on this because I stayed on line till it went through. Okay. Yeah, because I just pulled up the one that I sent to you as well, which gave me a confirmation number. Because I emailed that confirmation over to you that day that we made that payment. Right. So I just need to make sure that 10, 000 almost 10, 000 700 dollars does not come out of the account. Okay, I'm checking right now. Give me one second. Okay, so it does look like that when we made that payment it was applied but then it was returned so the payment was non sufficient. Well, that was impossible because the stop payment was put on the first 5, 377 dollars. So she said to me that that was that was the wrong account number. The your as in your bank account number. That's correct. Okay, so that's why it was that yes I I put I I did put a stop payment on the check and I've never had this kind of problem before. This was ridiculous that we're having. I mean I told her I said that check was sent out on July the third and it should have been in their hands in plenty of time for there not to be a problem and it's never been returned to me. So they're talking about the payment that we made over the phone. She is saying saying yes I got two letters I got two letters. First the first letter I got this week we were gone we were out of town was stating I had not made a payment that they were going to cancel my insurance policy. The second letter was stating that. Um, the bank refused payment. So I thought that was they had the check in their hands because yes the and I told her the bank would have refused payment on that check because I put a stop payment because the day before this was it set to expire or when it was due we did the routing number and the account number for my account and that was done through Alliance. So I'm not sure if it was if it was both receiving both letters that I received I don't know I don't know. But I just want to make sure that only one 5, 377 has been taken out of the account. Okay. So if you just made a payment today, I'm not going to be able to see it just yet. Um, the only one I'm showing is the one that me and you made online and that was the one that was returned. So basically it was never applied. The payment was reversed. Okay. So can I ask you why I would not have been notified of this? I'm not sure because they don't notify us either. So I'm not sure why if we because we both went over the account number I confirmed it with. Yeah, I told her I said we went over that account number and now I'm concerned today that doing it. See, this is why I don't like to do things this way electronically because they are just as inefficient sometimes and most of the times as sending a check. Truthfully, I mean I never have problems sending a check, but evidently to this company I mean I've never had this kind of problem ever. And so I don't know what has happened, but it's still we still can
