Hello. Hey Byron, this is Heather with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Pretty good, you. Doing good, um. So it looks like the issue with the Thunderbird and all and the Explorer, um, that we have to get a form called, um. Well, it's a statement of no loss, basically stating that you had no losses, from like eight one, which I think is when we removed the vehicle originally until now. Um. So would that be easiest if I send to you like via email or can you go to the one? Just mail it to me, ma'am. You want it snail milled. Yes. Okay, so I will I will get that. Now, ma'am, ma'am, we canceled the insurance on the Thunderbird. That's the only one we canceled. It on. Right, it looks like the Explorer was removed, and that's what we're trying to correct. Okay. And then the only thing is if we mail this, then it could take longer for us to get it fixed. But I will. Okay. We'll just just send it to the one to code office, whichever you want to do. Okay. Do you think you could maybe be there Monday? We'll just say Monday if you want to go sign it. That'll be fine. Okay, all right. I will let Addison know she will be there on Monday that you're coming by to sign. Okay. Okay, uh, I still haven't received nothing for the refund on the Thunderbird. Yeah, we're still trying to get everything corrected because of the mishap with the vehicle. So just bear with us, and once we get this, um, then we can make sure everything is corrected back to eight one. And get everything straightened up with the DMV as well. Okay. Right. Um. I'm gonna I'm gonna have to have take a copy of that to the DMV, right. Um. We will file an FS one electronically, and I say we, but it will be auto ones. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you, Byron. I'll have that, and just don't forget me on Monday. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. Uh huh. Okay.
