Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, I called the other day and she was supposed to call me back. She couldn't get the the insurance company to answer. Okay. I'm happy to hear from her. Okay. Um. Can I get your name? Denise Jordan. Okay, let's. I'm not sure who you spoke with. So let me. I don't remember either. Okay. Let's see. Looks like it was Tracy. Let me see if I can get her for you. Just one moment. All right. Thank you. You're welcome.
