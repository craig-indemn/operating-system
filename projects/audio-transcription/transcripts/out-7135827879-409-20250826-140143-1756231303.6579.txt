Hello, Marcia speaking. Hey, Marcia, this is Corbin with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm good, I'm good. Thanks for calling back. I checked. Yeah, I checked on it and I call Progressive. I got someone on the phone. They said, "Yeah, we got the change, but it takes 14 days from the time we send it down." So they said it probably end of this week or actually the 31st. We should see something if not sooner. So I was like, "Well, I wish somebody told me that earlier." But um. So the last time we sent stuff down was on the 17th. So she said around the 31st it should be processed. So I'll give it till then. Is that okay? I don't know what else. But like, what do we know? Like you know, once it is processed, like what it will be, what the rate is. Because you know originally it was like you know 58 dollars or something. I was like, "Yeah, I'll sign me up." Right. Now I have feel like I have no sense of what um, of what the monthly payment will be and what I'm paying for her insurance. The car looks like maybe that will stay the same. I'm not sure. I can't imagine that that's what's driving it up because it's a 2012 you know car. So and and it should have just the basic coverage. So it must be her original. It's messing it up. It's messing it up because they're not giving her driving experience. Once that drops off. Uh huh. We'll know for sure, but it's really hard to estimate. Even I've been doing this a long time. I can I can't estimate. Um, what the cost of the additional vehicle is using her taking off her inexperience. I have no idea. I would assume it's a lot less. So I say just give it a little bit longer. Okay. Sorry about that. It I didn't realize it's going to take 14 days, but I think it'll be sooner. But I think that's what they just tell everybody so they don't bug them every five minutes. All right. And they would appear automatically on the on the site. So I see it there. I won't need to call you if it looks good and if it doesn't, then I'll I'll call. Yeah, I'm gonna keep checking too. But if you said I don't mind you call me, I'd love to make sure. Yeah, yeah, I know. If you have time, if you have time, I know you're busy. Yeah, I will. All right, so look for it on the 31st and because what was the day it was submitted? 31st is Sunday, so it'll be the first. It'll be the first and that's a holiday, so the second. Oh, second, god, that's this weekend. Okay, good. I'm excited about. Yeah, that would be the second. Would that be 14 days? Plenty of days. Plenty of days. Okay. All right. Well, we will touch base again on on Tuesday. Alrighty, talk to you then. Alright, thanks. Bye bye.
