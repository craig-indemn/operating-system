Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. This is Cecilia. How can I help you? Hi Cecilia, this is Jenny Kelly with Auto Insurance. I was reviewing a policy. It looks like that you wrote at your business. For Pmart Horizon Properties LLC. Yes. There, it looks like their prior carrier wasn't listed because they had a nonpay. Cancel or it laps due to the address in the business was misplaced. I would need more information on like if they had a. Like their laps in coverage and who the prior carrier was. Okay, do you want me to um tell you or send you an email? Either one, whatever. I mean, do you know like how long the lapse was from? The prior to. The inception policy. Let me check. Let me pull it up and check. Hold on, four. The prior carrier was foremost or farmers, I guess. Yeah. And they had. Person who they called had that quit. And missed a payment, so that's like canceled back in. Oh, it was this year. It hasn't been like years and years. Let me look at my notes. Which location was it? I am sorry. That's okay. Let me. They have a lot with us. It looks like it's for one eight. One eighty Summit Street and three six one four Harvard Road. Something else for that one. Harvard Road. July. Okay, so it canceled. July. They've had no coverage since July. Correct. Not a location. Statement of no loss signed statement in order to move forward with this. And whenever if you have like something like this come across where they have a lot like a lapse or a cancel for nonpay, if you call us when you are writing the quote, like we can review it with you and note it if it's acceptable or not. I will since it's been well August September October. August only a couple months lapse. And considering the situation, but we do like to have like a advance.
