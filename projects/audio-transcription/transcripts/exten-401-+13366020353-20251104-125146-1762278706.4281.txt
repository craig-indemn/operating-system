Thank you for holding this chatter. Oh hey Heather it's Martin giving you a call again. I just wanted to see if my any chance yet had a chance to run the quotes. Sorry if I'm calling. I just kind of wanted to see what it was. Oh yeah so we're working on them. Okay. Yeah yeah yeah so I'll have those back to you if if should have them back to you before five today. If not Martin it will be first thing tomorrow. Gotcha okay just wanted to see what the time frame look like but I appreciate that. Absolutely yes yeah as soon as they were as soon as I get them back okay so we we take that information and send it to you know we're an independent broker so we have many carriers that we're courting them through to get you the best one. Gotcha all right sounds good do you know? Kind of I just I guess just want to just maybe a do you know an average like how much those kind of go for like the townhouse rates from what you've seen. Yeah it depends on like I mean there's so many different factors everybody is different even if you you know you had a neighbor there that was getting the exact same quote there's different a couple hundred dollars I mean it's based on well yours is on the end so there's would be you know in the middle of those the two firewalls on there's it's based off credit too you know and then your insurance history you know they they might have not like so good credit yours may be a quote and then like if if their insurance history if they had claims yeah you know it's so many different variables so it's hard it's hard to tell one person but I mean you're probably you know ballpark I would say maybe from like um maybe seven hundred to a thousand a year. Yep gotcha okay that's kind of where I figured though I just wanted just maybe like a ballpark yeah like I said I can't I can't tell you though but that that typically what I would see depending on different people's yeah you know what I mean like yeah so yeah it's hard to say but yeah once we get all those in we do order the report and say yeah and then and then I'll send you over the best ones sometimes I send you a couple of them just to give you some options there okay gotcha all right well sounds good then sorry to bother you I just wanted to find out no you're not a bother at all absolutely yeah no worries kind like I said if I don't have it back today I'll try to by five but if not it will be tomorrow no later than tomorrow. Awesome sounds good I'll be on the lookout for it. All right Martin, talk to you soon. Have a good one bye.
