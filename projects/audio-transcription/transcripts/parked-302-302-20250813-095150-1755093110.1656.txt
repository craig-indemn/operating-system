Thank you for holding, Misses Donna. How can I help you? Hey Donna, I got your email on that one for that claim. So the four addresses we have four addresses listed on the policy, and that's the same four addresses that you emailed to me. The only difference is I think one of them it shows seventy four sixty one Highway Eleven, we just show seventy four sixty one SC eleven. I mean that's just a typo or whatever, but so at what location did this claim occur? It was a South Carolina location, the Camp Camp Campbella Campground. Campabello, okay. Yeah. So you just needed to correct the address from right now. I'm showing the address is sixty four seventy one Highway Eleven, Campabello, but you said it should be seventy four sixty one SC eleven. Correct, and then I think there was another one. There was a morse location on there. There was, but it was deleted effective six one. Did I pull the wrong deck page? Because I went into that policy and pulled the policy. Maybe. Maybe I'm looking. You could have pulled the twenty four, maybe, but I'm looking at twenty five and we got those four locations listed. Okay, because Chase pulled the deck page and he's the one that told me that the addresses were incorrect. So if I go into the one that's effective now, which is ending in seven one for the policy. Right. Yeah, I'm gonna look at that one. Click, click on the policy down below where it generates the full policy page. We also need to generate. We also need to look at the endorsement. So okay, so that's gonna be my next question. If I click this policy, this is not the most updated policy. Is that correct? No, because they also look at the the latest endorsement that policy and it'll show physical locations added to the policy. It has twenty five eighty five Highway seventy two thirty five Crumpf Street, and the physical locations removed eleven oh one Aviation Parkway and twenty nine sixteen Interstate Street. So that would just like that policy you printed. That's the deck page when the policy was issued. That's the policy, and then it does replace the endorsements. I think we should be good. But the only the only thing in question is if if that one location. It's on there, but if it should say Highway Eleven or SC Eleven. I don't know if that really matters. How about say, did that make any difference or? I don't think so. Okay, anyways, I think we're good. Okay, perfect. I didn't realize that it didn't it didn't reprint the full that you had the full endorsement. I think that's just like whenever yeah just like whenever the policy printed that's that printed policy that's the PDF for that printed policy. Then you just have to look at the endorsements sent down to see the actual you know whatever changes have been made. Gotcha. All right. Well, thank you again. No worries. All right. Have a good day. Jesus. Bye.
