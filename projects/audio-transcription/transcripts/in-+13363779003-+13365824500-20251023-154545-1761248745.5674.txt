Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, good afternoon. How you doing, man? I'm good. How about you? All right. I have a good question. Okay. I got business with you guys and I tried to put a new car into my business. Normal, Jessica's the one taking care of my business, but I guess she's not available right now. She is. anybody else can help me? Wait. Yes, yes. She's out of the office this week, but yeah, let me get you over to another commercial agent that can help. Just one moment. Thank you. You're welcome.
