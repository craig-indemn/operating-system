Sorry, hold. This is Cody. I help you. Hi, Cody. This is Paula. I was referred by NC Carport and garages. To get a quote. This is for carport installation. Yes. Okay. Workers' comp and general liability. Okay. Give me just a second. What's the name of the new installation company? Bias Structures. Okay. Give me just a second. I need to print out another quote form. Okay. Yeah, fine. Let me go grab that. I'll be right back. Okay. Sorry about that. So you are going to work for NC Carports and Elkin. Yes. Okay. And what did you say the name of the is it is it an LLC or incorporated business? Yes. Okay. What's the name of it? Bias V A L L E S Structures. D A L L E S. Yes. Structures LLC. Yes. And that was created in North Carolina. Yes. Okay. Is this a new company a new LLC? No, I've had it for like three years. Okay. Have you had current insurance somewhere? Yes. Okay. Who are you currently with? By Burke. By Burke. Yes. Did you get that online or from an agency or? Online. Okay. Do you have the lost runs for your current policy, which is just like the claims history for your current policies? I have no lost runs. Because I'll probably need you to call them and get those. Have you had any claims on the policies? No. Okay. Do you have both like the workers' comp and the general liability through them? Yes. Okay. Can you call them and get a copy of the lost runs for both of your policies? That will. Yeah, I can do it. That will help me to get your quotes approved. I can. I can definitely do it. Can you I guess leave them? Have they got an expensive or? No, I am shopping for a cheaper quote. Where are I know renewal slipping. When is the renewal? November seven. He said eleven seven. Yes. Okay. How much is the workers' comp currently? Thirty four hundred. For the for the whole year. And how much is the package? The general liability. Thirty two hundred. And how much payroll do you have on your policies? I say about eighty thousand. Yeah, if it's you know if it's strictly a price thing, I don't think you are going to be able to get anything cheaper than that. Are they renewing your policies? Yeah. Okay. So you've already gotten the renewals for November and everything. Yes, I was just um. I've heard the other coworkers they had a cheaper. They're paying maybe like two thousand a year. I was just shopping around. Right. So I used to be able to get general liability and in the marine package policies for like fifteen hundred or so in North Carolina, but that company no longer writes new installers. So with eighty thousand in payroll, you know you are probably looking at about the same on the package policy. Maybe even a little bit more, and on the workers' comp, it would definitely be more than the thirty four hundred. So if it's just a price thing, I don't think that I would be able to get you any cheaper quotes. What if payroll went down, Dakota? What's that? How does payroll get verified? Well, payroll you have to do an all you do an audit every year on your current policies. I don't think. The first year I did do an audit, but this year I don't think I did an audit. Okay. Yeah, usually right after your policy renews, you'll start. You are the excuse me, you'll start getting your audit request from the companies, so you probably won't receive that until sometime in November or December. I would say. Okay. But as far as just the price goes, I know the quotes that I would get would be a little higher than what you are paying currently. So if you have a renewal from from By Burke, I would and everything's good on your policies, and NC Carports is good with everything. Then I don't think that I would be moving from those to be honest. What about um commercial? Do you do commercial? Auto. Yes, I do commercial auto. Do you have a current policy? Yes. Is it through Progressive or who's it through? Progressive. How much is that one a year? Seven. Oh, a year or not monthly at pay. What do you pay monthly? Said seven hundred and something. Yes, seventy something. Is it just one truck and one trailer? Yes. Okay. Have you had any claims on that policy? No. Okay. If you call Progressive and get the lost runs for your Progressive policy, does that one renew in November as well? Yes, so. Yeah, I'll have some better options as long as you haven't had any Okay, do you have any other last names or anything? No. Okay, and what is your home address, Paul? Five zero four, North Wilson Avenue. And Dunn, C U N N. The zip code is two eight three three four. Okay, and is this your cell phone number? Yes. Okay. I see it's an Indiana phone number. Is that where you are from originally? Yes. Okay. What made you come down here? Get out of the cold. I was no, I was actually from here originally, and then I moved to Indiana for about two years and I came back. I got you. Do you grew up around here? Yes. Gotcha. Um, Paul, what's a good email address for you? Uh, Colin and then. Roden which is R O L D A N. Three four at Gmail. Okay. And do you have a North Carolina driver's license again now? Yes. Okay, what is your NC driver's license number? Three six seven eight zero eight seven three. Three six seven eight zero eight. Yes, seven three. Seven three. Okay. Who's the driver for your truck when it's out on the road? Is it your husband or? That thing. I drive it. You drive it when they go out on the road. Yes. Are you the owner of the LLC as well? Yes. Okay. Do you actually do the installs? No, I'm I'm just the driver and. The boss and the accountant. I got you. Okay. My husband is the one that does the installs and. Okay, but he doesn't ever drive or any of the helpers don't ever drive. No, they sleep. They do long drives, so that's. Yeah. They'll sleep on the drive. I understand. Just keep in mind if anybody ever had an accident and they weren't listed as a driver, you are definitely it's possible to deny the claim in this situation. So just be careful not to let anybody else obviously drive when it's out on the road and stuff. Um, if I do, like I want to add my husband. Um. That would raise the insurance. Correct. I would have to. Not necessarily. No, does he have tickets and accidents and stuff on his record or what? He does. What does he have on there? Uh, once he has the. View speed tickets. I know he got a lawyer, but I even remember. I know he has like two. Speeding tickets, but he doesn't have any like reckless driving DUIs or anything like that. No, I mean speeding's already reckless enough. And has he had any has he any accidents or anything? No. Just those. And those speeding tickets are they in the last few years or how old are they? Yeah, they're in the last couple years. Okay, and he's only had two. Two that I know of. Okay. So I am saying honestly, I don't know. I can run his motor vehicle record and see what it pulls. If you think it's going to be really bad, then I probably shouldn't waste my time doing that. But. If he's only had a couple. If he's only had a couple
