Thank you for holding, this is Heather. Hello, Heather. This is Shivan Sherman. Hi. How are you? I'm doing well. I just picked up the mail and I got a letter from the Department of Transportation. Oh yeah. DNV. They're looking for a Form FS dash one. Yes. That happens, Shivan. Whenever we usually when we change your insurance coverage from one carrier to another. Because what happens like who, whoever we had you with or your current, insurance carrier was. Was it Liberty Mutual? I can't remember. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When you cancel that. Yeah, so when you cancel that one, they send a notice to DNV that you no longer have insurance. Even though we rewrote you to another carrier, but it happens all the time. But yes, Shivan, if you can, if I can get you to submit that. You can email that letter. Are you able to do that? Yeah. Yeah, I can. I'll take a photograph of it and then. That would be perfect. And let me give you the email address that that needs to go to. Okay. It's going to be support. S u p p r a c. It's our support line. And it's support at myallianceinsurance dot com. So it's the same as our all of our emails. Myallianceinsurance dot com. But it's going to go to support. Right. Okay. I can do. And they will take care of that for you. Is it just for one vehicle? Did you get multiple letters? Okay, I know I just got the one vehicle. Okay, all right. So yeah, just send that in and they'll get that handled for you. Totally. And so. Yeah, it should go away. I know sometimes you might get another one. Here in a few weeks if it if it doesn't, they just get crossed over in the mail. I guess. Yeah, and then it's like they just give you a ten days. Like I mean, it has to be. Submit it electronically, no later than nine one twenty twenty five. And it's like that's that's not great. And so and so when we if they get it submitted today, ours is live like it goes through electronically. So they would get noticed today. DNV would and you would be able to see that on line. But again, for some reason the letters go out. I don't know if they're like automatically generated and it'll go out again. So you may get another one, but just let us know. Also. Yeah, but this happens all the time. Like I said, whenever you change carriers, most of the time or you cancel if your policy has a lapse or cancels. But it's you know you you don't have a lapse in coverage, so we just have to submit that again. Just to let us know. Hey. We did rewrite you. Isn't that easy? Right. Oh well, thanks for the plan on all of that. You know, so so that's good. I'll I'll get on with that now. Okay. Yeah, yeah, just send that over to support and they'll get that taken care of. Okay. All right. Thanks so much, Heather. Have a great rest of your day. Is everything else going well for you? Yes, it is, and yeah, actually I was talking to my neighbor the other day and I was telling her you know my little story. I said, "Yeah, we're with Cincinnati as well." Really? Yeah. Well, good. Yeah. What would say? Any of your neighbors or friends? Just have them have them shoot me an email or call me and I'll be glad to quote it. But I think Cincinnati is the best in my opinion. Well, yes. I love them. I really do. As far as like I just heard great reviews with them. They're one of our top carriers. They're auto owners and Penn National, but I really like them. As far as especially like our underwriter, I'm really close with. So it makes it easier, you know, when you have a good relationship. With them, their underwriter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So but yeah, please you know send send all the business over. I'll quote it for. Fair enough. Well, good Heather. Thanks so much. Okay, Shivan. You take care, honey. And you bye bye. Thanks.
