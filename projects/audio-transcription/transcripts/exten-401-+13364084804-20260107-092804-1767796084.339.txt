Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Hey, Heather, Tomas Figueroa. How are you? Hey, I'm doing okay. How are you doing? Doing good, doing good. Happy new year. Yeah, we're here again, right? I know, isn't it crazy? Guys. But but yeah, I'm just calling you because we got rid of one of the cars and we got another car, so I just wanted to make that change. All right. Give me one second. All right, let me have a difficulty again in Cincinnati this morning. Let me just take down that information. Or Tomas, could you email me the VIN numbers? Yeah, you want the VIN number. Yeah, just give it an email that you're going to replace, whichever vehicle you're replacing, and then to add the new vehicle with the VIN number. Okay. If you can do that, that would be wonderful. Okay. Is that all you want? The VIN number part. Yeah, you want the same coverage and everything, right? Just the coverage remains the same as the other vehicle. Yep, that's all. Yeah. And the lien holder will be the same. It's true liens. Okay. Yep, if you just include that in the email. Okay. Okay, I'll send you that. Got to work. Yep, and then we can get it added, and then what that process. We can get you you know your ID card sent over to you. Okay, sounds good. Okay. Perfect. No, that would be I guess whenever you process that we already have a car here today. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. So I guess it would be effective whatever today or something of that maybe. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. All right. Sounds good. Well, I'll I'll send you that email. Okay, honey. All right, and you got it, don't you? It's Heather S. Heather S at my alliance. Yeah, let me.
