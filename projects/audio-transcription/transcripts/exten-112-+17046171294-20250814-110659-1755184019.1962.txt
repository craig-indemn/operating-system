Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hi, Brandi. It's Holly Shields. Getting a call. Have a few questions about our auto insurance. All right. Let me get you pulled up. You said auto, right? Yes. All right, and what is your question on our auto policy? So we found our policy, and they moved Whitman to his own policy, and then I paid both of those in full. Um, but now I'm receiving bills for remaining balances. All right. Let me see. Rosco isn't licensed, right? No, he just has his permit. Okay. Um, that's one of the things that they're needing, and then the other thing which I sent them. I need to verify that Whitman has his own insurance, which I did send that to them. Um, so I have to resend that in again, and then we should be able to take care of that. Um. That is the only thing I'm seeing that they're asking about. It's just those two things. Um. Let me pull up Whitman real quick. Yeah, Whitman's bill is significant. Me, it's over four thousand dollars, and that's not what his quote was at all. All right. Let me reach out to National General and get all of this taken care of and get his policy back to normal and get your policy back to normal. Um. I sent in all the proof that they needed. I don't know why they didn't. I don't know who messed up on this on National General side. Um. So I'm just going to give them my call and make sure that both policies get back to normal, to the way that they were. And then I will um give you a call, and let you know that everything is good. Um. Holly, I'm going to text you. And if you can, just whenever you get a chance, send me a picture of his permit, and then. That's one of the things I can cross off. Okay. Um, and then hopefully I'll be back in touch with you. If not today, then tomorrow. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Was there anything else? That's all. All right. Well, I will be in touch with you soon. Okay. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye.
