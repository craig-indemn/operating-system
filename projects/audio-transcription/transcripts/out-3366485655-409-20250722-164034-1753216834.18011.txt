Hello. Hey Morgan, this is Corbin again. I'm sorry about you. Hey, I did have a thing in there about a mobile home. Did do we need to do anything with that or not right now? I didn't. Yeah, that's what I got to figure out about maybe some homeowners. Okay, are y'all y'all taking over? Yeah, just let me know when you get around to doing that. I can get that ready for you. Okay. That's why I had that in there. I couldn't figure out why, but okay, I think. Yeah, yeah, I just got to figure out what I mean. Not a problem, but just let me know. I won't bother you. All right, thanks, bye.
