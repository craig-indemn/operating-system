Hello. Hey, I was just giving you a quote. I didn't touch base with you. I haven't got the quote back to add a vehicle to your auto policy from your carrier yet. I'm still waiting. Oh man, this is a. It takes a week to get a quote. I mean, that's just crazy. Yep, and that's another reason they're they're going out of business. Damn. Okay, can you do can you look at my file and even tell if I have any points? Yeah, I did requote it. You do not have any points. I didn't think I did. I pulled my driving record and I didn't see none. I just wanted to make sure. Yep, you don't. All right, are y'all lean super aggressive? We are. Yeah. Okay, well maybe just see if you can get me a quote on progressive on both of my cars. Okay, let's see when's your renewal. I think March April I think. April. Yeah, so Main Street's going to be cheaper. So right now you're paying 1477 for the year. I'm getting quotes around 2300. For just the Honda, 2300. Why is it jumping double? Again, because Main Street America had such low rates for a long time. They they put themselves out of business. So they're they're very low rate. I mean, even when before I had North Main, I had something else and I didn't get that price. Right. Well, and I don't want I just want the 5100 dollars. We actually a thousand dollar deductible. Okay, I can go to a thousand dollar deductible for sure. Our agency does require the 100 300. Okay, so I would have to go to a whole new insurance place to get what I want than what you're saying. Yes, we can't do the 5100. Okay. All right. Well, just yeah, just see if it's going to cost to add that car just to the end of my policy and then I'll be looking at other insurance companies. Okay then. All right, as soon as I get. You ain't got one on my house insurance yet either. I did I did run the quote on the house insurance. The only carrier I have that would do the mobile home as foremost, and it was double what you're paying. Okay. All right, thank you. All right, I'll let you know as soon as I get the quote back to add that vehicle. Okay. Okay, thank you. Thank you.
