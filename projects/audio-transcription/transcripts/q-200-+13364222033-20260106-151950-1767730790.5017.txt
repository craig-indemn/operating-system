And what kind of motorcycle is it? It's a Kawasaki Z400. Got. And when would you need it start? What day? Like the twentieth of this month. Twenty. Okay. And you want full coverage or just liability. Uh, full coverage. And your address one nineteen May. May, Mayfair Drive, Winston 727105. No sir, the street and city is correct, but the number of the house is one thirteen. Yeah, one thirteen. I'm so sorry, one thirteen Mayfair Drive. That's my fault. Gotcha. That was a test. No, I'm just checking. Are you the only driver or do we need to add Tony? No sir, I'll be the only driver for that. And are you married, single, separate, divorced? Would it? Single. And how many years motorcycle experience have you had? Three years. And how many? Looks like you've only had one year driving experience. Is that right? Am I reading that right? For my license, yeah. And do you have that NSF rider course? Did you take that by chance? Yes, sir. And you have the motorcycle endorsement on your driver's license. Yes, sir. And have the VIN number to the motorcycle? You want to read that to me. Yes, sir. I couldn't provide that. It's going to be. J K A E R K D one X P D A R nine eight nine zero. Um, let me repeat that back to you: J is in John, K is in kite, A is in apple, E is in umbrella. Excuse me, E is an elephant. R is in Robert, K is in kite, E is an elephant, one. X is an echoey. It was K and then D. D. Like D is in David. Yes, sir. Okay. Is that a twenty three Kawasaki ER400? Yes, sir. And how do you use that vehicle just for pleasure use only or you can use. Pleasure use. I said CCs are three ninety nine or something. Alright. Yes, sir. Is it modified in any way? No sir. Does have an anti theft device on it. Oh, no, no, no, no. You're not talking about the ABS, right? No, no, no. It's it's a theft recovery device. Do you have anything like that? Oh no, sir. Okay. And. Hang on one second for me. Okay. Sorry about. And you're going to keep it at the two seven one zero five zip code. Yes, sir. And is it financed or anything? Yeah. And are you a homeowner or renter? Well, I live with my parents, and they own their home. Okay. Uh, you remember any nationally recognized motor motorcycle associations. Um, you okay with going paperless? What is that? It's like you don't get any mail. It's all through the. Oh yeah, man. Yeah, I don't even like mail. I don't even check that. I agree. Does the two thousand twenty three. ER400 have an engine guard frame slider? No sir, it's a naked bike. You don't even have fairing. Okay. It's not like considered sport bike. And you wanted full coverage, right? Sorry, it's taking just a minute. All right. You said you wanted a comp and collision. You want to what kind of deductibles? You want you want five hundred dollars deductibles or. You want lower deductibles. Hello. One moment. One moment. How. Sure. You said what kind of deductible I wanted. Yeah, you want lower deductibles or you want around five hundred. What's the lowest? You can do. There's two deductibles. You got comprehensive. You can go to a hundred. And then collision. There's a deductible. You can. Yeah, go from one hundred to five hundred or a thousand. But this is like for full cover, right? Yes. Correct. Full full coverage means comprehensive and collision coverage. That's the fix your vehicle if it's broke. You know somebody hit you and they don't have insurance, or if your bike stolen. Yeah. You can. Yeah. Okay. Then I'll do the collision for a hundred. Well, the you can do. There's two deductibles. The comprehensive is is deductible is like if your. Motorcycle stolen. Yeah, and then collision is. I would probably put that at five hundred. That's the fix your car if there's a if you're in an at fault accident. So the comprehensive are things out of your control. The collision. Okay. Then I'll do the collision. I'll do the collision at five hundred and the comprehensive at a hundred. Okay. And you want towing and labor and and roadside assistance for your bike. Does the full coverage not include that? Well, no, it's separate. It's a separate coverage. You can have towing. Or you can have. Does it say like a price for like what's the difference with it and without? Yeah, I could tell you. So the liability is going to run you. Two sixteen, three seventeen. Two twenty one. Two twenty one a year. Plus, and then the comp. Is going to run you one thousand forty one dollars. Every six excuse me one thousand forty one. The collision is going to cost two thousand twenty two dollars a year. The towing will be eight dollars and the roadside assistance ten dollars. Let me quote you with. Let me quote you with one more company. Seems high. Don't. Okay. We try you with one more. And what's your date of birth again? What year did you buy the bike? Last year, twenty twenty five. How many miles do you think you ride a year? Shit. Give or take a thousand because you know this season also. I don't think so. Not no more than two thousand miles. I'm a rider here. Okay. And what's your highest level of education? College, finish high school, graduate school. And you got your driver's license number handy. It should be. Forty two, forty six, thirty sixty six. So forty two, forty six, thirty sixty six. Yeah. All right. Yeah, looks like Progressive's much cheaper. If you do the bank, if you do the monthlys on a card. Or if you do if you pay with a checking account, monthly. You can do fifteen percent down, so it'd be three sixty six down, one eighty nine a month after that. Okay. Yeah, and then if you could pay it in full, it's three hundred dollars cheaper. If you can just knock it out in one payment, it's twenty one hundred. You do about a card. It's about two dollars higher a month. Like you put on an automatic card, it's about two dollars a month. Well, I think I'm going to just check them out. And if you wanted that towing and labor and all that stuff broken down. You know whether you wanted or not. It cost about for just liability for the breakdown. The towing and labor cost eight dollars a year, for up to one hundred dollars of coverage. And then the collision. The collision is the most expensive part. You got a five hundred dollars deductible and it's sixteen ninety four a year just for the collision. So the collision part is what makes it so expensive. And then. Yeah, but yeah, I guess you have to have it if you're financing it. So. Yeah. But yeah, that would be the lowest one. Okay, I appreciate. I think I'm going to just. Check around and see some other quotes. See what I. Okay. All righty. Yep. Thank you. Now goodbye.
