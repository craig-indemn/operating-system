Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hey, good afternoon. Um, this is Ralph Kidley. I'm Cohen. We need to file a claim with our auto insurance. Okay. I talked to people in the office, and it's frustrating situation. But anyway, um, I need to go ahead and do this now. Somebody hit my wife and lied about it and all that stuff. And I've talked to Tracy in the office and um, talked to the officer that responded. It's just kind of frustrating these days. I don't know. So hard these days that you get hit. It's hard. It's really hard to follow up and pursue. Okay. Yeah, let me. Yeah, let me get you over to an agent so they can help you get that filed. It'll take me just a moment. You're fine. Thank you. You're welcome.
