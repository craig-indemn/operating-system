Great morning at Alliance Insurance. This is Jamie. Did you say your name was Jamie? My name is Jamie. Yes, sir. Jamie, I want to make a change to my wife and my policy on her auto. As I, I got a renewal thing that comes up October eighth and on Allstate, and I logged on and looked at it. And me and my wife agree, it's kind of stupid for us to, you know, we've had homeowners homeowners in a automobile with Allstate for like thirty five years, but. Me and my wife agree, it's kind of stupid to keep full coverage on her oh seven Corolla car that's eighteen years old, so we think it's time to drop it to liability after eighteen years. You know what I mean. It might become. Good morning. My phone system pulled me into David Buchanan. Yeah, David. David and Pamela Buchanan. Okay, I was about to ask. I've actually got a couple of David Buchanons in this. Right, yeah, you do, and because one time y'all sent us something and I thought, well, hey, this is not us. We're the one forty seven Monroe Road Mount Airy. I see that. I see that, and I do see. Yeah, home auto with Allstate. Yeah, we got homeowners too. I was going to was going to change the homeowner. Somebody named JC and then she emailed me back and going from five hundred to a thousand dollar deductible. We're home, where everything keeps going up. We're only going to save like one hundred and sixty some dollars. So we didn't do it, but to save like one hundred and fifty one dollars. You know, for the full coverage, we just want to drop it to like the Jeep is the liability, just like the Jeep is. Okay. And I told my wife, I'd have saved us one hundred and fifty dollars right there by itself. And I said, "Honey, you know what? I don't know why we keep overlooking that. But a vehicle eighteen years old, I think it's time to drop it. You know what I mean? " Well, and you are not wrong, David. Auto policies in North Carolina pay out on an actual cash value basis. So you know, my car is and the car's in really good shape. The car's in really good shape, Jamie. But I told my wife, "Honey, that's that's not the point. If something was to happen to it, Allstate won't want to give us nothing for it anyway, probably. " They're going to look at they're going to look at Kelly Blue Book value. They're going to probably do a Google search of what that vehicle would sell for in your zip code, and then they probably got a couple other data points that they would look at. I tell them one thing. I tell them one thing, though Jamie. I tell them one thing. Oh Jamie, I am sixty five years old. Me and my wife have had quite a few vehicles over the years, but you know, you know, I don't know if it's that certain year or not. But that oh seven Toyota Corolla has been probably the best car we've ever had in our life. You know, it's that certain year. You know what I mean? I don't know. I had a I had a Nissan Altima or Maxima for a long time in my life, and that thing was the best car that I probably have ever had as far as giving me. It didn't give me any issues. How that one experience. I unfortunately got crushed in the thing a guy ran a red light and hit me in it and and I moved on from it and I've kind of kicked myself ever since. So yeah, you know. Yeah, what year was yours? What year was it? Was it was it was an O one? It was an O one Maxima that I bought used with probably sixty thousand miles on it. Yeah, outside outside of putting a battery in it, I don't think I had to do an old change. There wasn't a single other thing that happened until they got crushed. You probably can't look back, but we had a Maxima. I think ours was a two thousand model that was a really good one years and years ago a white one. It was a really good car. My wife used to drive it up and down the Winston when Dell computer was open down there. My wife parked the Dell computer until they shut down. She loved going up and down fifty two in that Maxima. And I think it was a two thousand. It might have been O one, but I think it was two thousand. Sometimes you just got to stick with what works. You know, I can tell you, I've also got a Jeep Wrangler that I love. I love my Jeep, but good lord, that thing is a constant headache Or than it was yesterday or last year or the year before and that is the reason that's one thing that I've always checked. You are from Mount Erie so if you are from Mount Erie do you remember Jonas Clark being around here? I sure do yeah yeah. Okay, well the superintendent was Jonas Clark, so I am pretty good about keeping up with houses and even roof and plumbing. I don't know what I worked for Richard Vaughn he owned Jonas Clark there until until he shut everything down. Yeah. And so I keep up the fault. I was going to tell you be glad we don't live where my brother lives in Orlando Florida boy you ought to you ought to hear the numbers he tells me about insurance down there. It's David there is going to be there is data out there right now that shows that there is going to be an Exodus out of Florida at some point in the next few years. Yeah he said it's getting so bad he said the auto and it's not just a homeowner's homeowner's real bad auto too but God the numbers he gives me it's almost like twice more than mine you know what I mean. Oh absolutely and it's going to get worse. The largest insurance carrier in the state of Florida right now is the state of Florida it's called the Citizens Fund and what that means David is that when a let's say a storm comes across the tip of Florida and wipes out you know a bunch of homes. Everybody in the state is going to eat that the people up in Tallahassee the people up in the middle of Florida who had nothing to do with nothing they are unfortunately going to eat that money too when their homeowners policy is it's coming to a point it probably is already there for a lot of people now but it's going to get worse. At some point in time the mortgage the insurance payment is going to be more than the mortgage payment in the state of Florida and that is going to that's going to prevent people from buying the next generation of people and their kids kids they're not going to be able to purchase something there unless they've inherited a ton of money. Or they got some other resource to get into a loan. Say I and my daughters I got two daughters they moved of course they moved right to they they got their own homes they've been through college got their bachelor's degrees they're up in their thirties now of course they followed right along with me and my wife of all state Jamie but but about six years ago. One of them five years other one six they switched to the other one to State Farm and they said that they basically almost have the same coverage homeowner's automobile but they act like they saved a bunch of money by by getting away from all state and they went to State Farm but me and my wife never changed you know what I mean. Well yeah I mean so well I'll say this like State Farm is a captive carrier so the only let me feel that onion for you I am Jamie I work for Alliance Insurance and I have appointments with a bunch of carriers. So God forbid something happened to all state they go crazy with this rate or something I have other options that I can sell you okay or I can present to you State Farm is a captive carrier. So it would make no difference David if you are in Mount Erie North Carolina or you are in the middle of Arkansas that guy or woman with the red shirt on works for State Farm and the only product that they can sell you is State Farm products. Which is good and bad what that means is that you might fit your daughters they might fit in that State Farm bubble and have excellent rates until life changes somehow. And they fall out of their preferred pricing tier and then at that point in time they're in a stuck situation of do they stay with State Farm or do they go through the hassle of moving everything and when I say hassle I mean it is a pain in the butt now to move like for example. Homeowners insurance any new carrier like if I even if I had somebody up and I don't siblings or I don't I don't have any other carrier that would beat all state off your pricing but let's say I did. The carrier is going to come out and inspect your property within the first thirty sixty days of writing that policy for you and in the event that they find something on your property that they don't like they would then issue you a notice in writing and it would say. You know take down the shed fix it up or we're going to cancel this policy and I have seen that trip people up to where they can't afford to fix something or they don't want to fix something that the carrier you know because the carriers put eyes on the home at that point in time and they said you are going to fix this or we're not going to insure you. The client goes to argue the carrier cancels the policy and then the and then at that point in time David or Jamie or Bob whoever is is back on the market again trying to find another insurance carrier to insure the home
