Hello. Hi, is this Julia? Yes, we did. My name is Jessica with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Yes. Yes. I was giving you a call back. You left us a voicemail about needing some help with business insurance. Yeah, the insurance actually. Actually, do you have those kind of insurance like instructor, mobile, and instructor insurance? It was a fitness instructor. Is that what it is? Do you have that? Yes, we do. Yeah, what's your code? What's what's the what I am sorry. Yes, very basic one. What's your code? Oh, okay. So I'm looking for I'm looking for a better quote because I haven't heard from you. I only want to get the other one. But I'm just saying, what's your code? For the basic, very basic one, it's general. Very general, basic. Give me one moment. So it's not a set amount for. Like I don't have a set amount that I can give you. I just have to run the quote so to know what it is for you. So bear with me. I can ask you a few questions and we can get that number. What's the name of your business? Not no name. Just my own personal. I I teach in classes for the senior center. They want me to have my own insurance. So when I teach in. Just my own my own style. I'm the. I don't have no name. It's my own name. No worries. Yeah. And you're still on two ten Turkey Hill Road right? Yeah yeah yeah I have insurance with you the. I think the either home insurance or car insurance. Yeah I was able to pull that up. Thank you. Yeah yeah yeah. So I'm thinking maybe I can give you a better quote order. Because the other they just thinking they charge me too high because it's so. Basic one. And you just need liability, right? You're not looking for coverage for property. No, just no. How long have you been doing this personal training? I've been doing insurance for two or three years already. I have one with the other company, K and K. Because this year when I'm when I'm re um. Renewed, I say if I have my own insurance, I wonder how they called me. Because I don't earn much, they don't pay me much, and then I end up paying much. You know. I just feel like I want to look for cheaper ones, so I just don't bother you. Gotcha. You don't have any you haven't had any claims right. Never. Never. Yeah, funny part is they all sign up, and when we when we teach in classes, everybody has to sign up their own waiver. You know what I mean. So um, but um, the senior center still want me to have that. Cover their kind of stuff. Just their rule. I have been teaching for them for so long, but all of a sudden they wanted. They they just came in here. Something they changed. I never. I never have any money. And what is the annual revenue that you make or generate from this business? Generate this business. Oh. Well, maybe ten thousand around that around that number. Ten thousand. Ten thousand for the whole year. About sometimes lower, sometimes higher. Okay. Because they have a like a grand program and they they they want to teach in more. Sometimes lower, sometimes just much lower. I give you this very high. Eight thousand nine thousand. So it looks like for the year, just a basic general liability policy would be two hundred and fifty. That's okay. I keep the one I have right now. That's fine. Thank you. Appreciate. Yeah, much hi. Yeah, thank you.
