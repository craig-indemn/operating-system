Yes, ma'am. Hi, my name is Meghan. I'm calling on behalf of Centrex now through Westbank. This call may be monitored or recorded to ensure quality customer service. And I'm calling to obtain renewal information on farm policy for me too, customer. Okay, what's the name on the account? The name is Kenneth H. Robinson three. And can you confirm the address on the account for me? Sure, two five three eight Winslow Road, Robinsonville, North Carolina two seven eight seven one. And you have a policy number. I have the policy number. It's F as in Frank, A as in Alpha, B as in Bravo, one two five five three one W as in William. Okay. Let me get it pulled up here. Bear with me one moment. Sure. Okay. Can you repeat that policy number for me one more time, please? Yes, sure. It's F as in Frank, A, Alpha, B Bravo, one two five five three one W as in whiskey. Okay, and what coverages are you looking to verify? I am calling to verify. I mean, I'm calling to obtain the renewal information on the farm policy. And I have the effective expiration date as zero one one five two zero two six two zero one one five two zero two seven. Yes. Help me with the annual premium amount, please. Let me pull it up. Premium amount is fifteen thousand one hundred sixty five. I have the premium. I mean, for the current year, as one eight zero eight. Fifteen thousand one hundred sixty five seems a bit. I mean seems a lot higher than that. Can you please recheck for the renewal premium? If this is for the farm policy. Okay. That is the correct premium for the renewal. One five one six five right, and it's fully outstanding. Let me check the billing to see. Okay. Yes, it is outstanding. Okay, what is the dwelling coverage amount? It's not showing on this renewal doc. Let me see if I can pull it up somewhere else. Okay. What was the premium amount that you said that you had? I had one eight zero eight for the current term. Okay, so the policy number that you provided me with is for. It's under K and J Farms. But they have another policy with Westfield that has their dwelling on it. That's under their actual name, Kenneth and Starla Robinson. And that's the policy that has the primary dwelling. So I think the policy numbers might be mixed up. That might be the case. Is the property address in? It is. Let me see. Twenty five thirty eight Winslow Road. That's right, Robinsonville, North Carolina two seven eight seven one. Gotcha. Yeah, so for that one. I have the dwelling amount at four hundred fifty five thousand five hundred. Okay, I have that one as well. And what is the annual premium for this policy? One thousand eight hundred sixty eight. That is fully outstanding at the moment, right? No, sure. This policy doesn't renew until June twelfth. And that's the policy that has their primary home on it. The other policy that we were looking at with that fifteen thousand dollar premium. Um, that's their farm. They're both written on farm forms, but they're used for different purposes. If that makes sense. So that one is the one that is expiring soon. I think there's just been a little bit of miscommunication here. So for the same property address, they have a different farm policies. Yes. Okay, and for that policy, you are not able to give me the due amount, right? Well, I can. Um. That farm policy was at fifteen thousand dollar premium. And then this policy that has their primary dwelling on it, it's also a farm policy. That premium is eighteen sixty eight, but I don't have the renewal premium because it doesn't renew until June. So we won't have any documents for a little bit. Okay, okay, that is no problem. Um, you can provide me with any email or fax number where I can request for the policy. You can email support at myallianceinsurance dot com. Support at myallianceinsurance dot com right? A l l i n c. Yes. Okay, can I please have your first name and last name initial for my notes? Addison A D I S O N as in Nancy. Last initial N as in Nancy. Okay, thank you so much for it. Okay, you can please have a good day, Addison. Bye bye. Thanks, you too. Bye.
