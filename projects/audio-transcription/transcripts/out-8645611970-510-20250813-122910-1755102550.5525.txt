Hello. Hi, is Grant available? Hi, this is Pam. Hi, it's Tracy calling from Alliance Insurance. Hey, how are you? Good, how are you doing? Good. Good, I got your voicemail. To answer your question about the garage, it's the garage of your choice as long as it's within 15 miles of where it's disabled. So if it's in your driveway, they can tow it to a place of your choice within 15 miles from your house. Okay, so 15. I guess so. My question. So I think the current policy we have is 100. I believe. I mean, 15 miles of towing is usually not beyond 100. Dollars. I just want to understand what the difference was between them. Well, they say all reasonable expenses because some states like Virginia have passed laws that says basically the insurance company has to pay something. So they're charging in a neighborhood of 3, 000 dollars to tow it. So yeah, it's ridiculous. So that's why it says all reasonable costs. That way, if you're being overcharged for it, they won't pay for the overcharge. But there is a number that you call on the roadside card, and they can dispatch somebody that has agreements with auto owners. Yeah, well, and that's and that's so. I mean, the reason I'm asking is we my wife recently had something happen. We have AAA. We also, you know, we had to they they were being a problem. We called auto owners. It service was great and showed up within an hour. So that's the reason I was wanting to you know quite frankly switch it and get it on both cars to have it. I just didn't know. I mean, I knew we had 100. Of max up to 100, and I was trying to. If you break down 50 miles away, so what they're going to tow a max of 15. The closest route. Yep. Now here's the difference between auto owners and AAA. Auto owners follows your vehicle. AAA follows you. So say you're in Florida and your rental car breaks down. You can call AAA. Yeah, I don't really even care about that anymore. I'm fine with that piece of it. I was I was more, you know, say we're you know 60 miles away from home. Is it you know the home garage versus? A, you know, garage wherever we are that's that's what I was wanting to see the covered or not. Yes, it will. Yep, say you you walk out and your car just won't start and you got to have it towed. They'll you can tow it within 15 miles of there. Now let me go ahead and added to both both cars. Okay. Let me take a look at this. And what they do is it's considered an occurrence. So say your car breaks down, and you have it towed to the shop, and then you find out that. The engine's blown and they can't fix it, or they want an arm and a leg to fix it. So you have it towed to your house. That's considered one occurrence. Okay. Okay, so and then you submit the receipts on that one. It'll count as a one occurrence. All right. But if you just you know you have to have it towed, they fix it. You're able to drive it home. You're good to go. And then the next time you have to have it towed again, it's a separate occurrence. All right, and so that's the the biggest policy or the I guess the most lenient they have the all reasonable is better than their 100 cap. Yes. And I can email you a copy of their pamphlet so you can take a look at that as well. Yeah, if you wouldn't mind doing that. Yeah, absolutely not. It'll tell you what all they offer, and number to call all that fun stuff. All right, that'll work. I'll probably put that in both cars. Okay, that sounds great. I'll just send you two copies, or you can just get one and print on both out. Whatever works. Yeah. Okay, well I get that process for you and I'll email over this pamphlet for you. All right, I appreciate. Thank you for your help. You are welcome. You have a great day. You too. Thanks. Bye bye.
