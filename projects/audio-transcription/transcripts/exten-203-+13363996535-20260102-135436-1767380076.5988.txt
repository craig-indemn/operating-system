Alliance Insurance is Maria. Hi Maria, this is Melissa Lail. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. I got your email. I'm sorry I didn't see your phone call. So that's just a change. It's the change in my current policy to a thousand dollar deductible. Is that what that is? Correct. Yes. Okay. I went ahead and paid because I didn't mind the lapse. So if I want to change to this one, will you credit me for later on for what I've already paid or what? How will that affect that? Here we go into your account real quick. When did you make the payment? Okay, I see it was made on the first. On the first, yeah, okay, on the first, yeah. Let me see something. I can't backdate it, but if I made it effective today, hold on one second. Okay. It's just it's going to lower the next payment due to one twenty nine and ninety four cents. Okay, so you basically I paid for it. I guess that's what I'm saying in some sort way. Is that how that works? It is the earned premium that you paid. So, yes, yeah. Okay. So when when it's due again, it'll be what one twenty nine and ninety four cents. Yes. Okay, all right. So that works. Go ahead and process up. Yes, please. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. It does take some. Absolutely, every bit helps. Yeah. Okay. You are taking care of ma'am. All right. Thank you so much. Have a good afternoon. Bye bye.
