Hello, this is Fern. Hey Fern, this is Brandy with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good. Um. So yes, whenever we um issued your policy, I had talked to um. Michael and he said that you had a water shut off system. On the house. Well, yeah, and we realized that it was actually just a to the um. Hot water heater. It wasn't. I mean, it's not. I was just kind of confused at what they really wanted, what they were saying. Um. And um. Then looking up what a automatic water shut off entails is like a 500 dollar unit. Um. And so I just didn't I and this was not back then. So we just really didn't know what we were supposed to be actually doing. And so I. So that was um I feel badly that we did so I guess I just got word I mean I got a thing in the mail that the insurance was canceled. Yeah, because I've been trying to because Michael said that he was going to send over the proof, and then I hadn't heard back from him. So I've been following up with him to see if he could send that to me and then. I mean, since Cincinnati doesn't have it, they did send out a cancellation. But that is for the. Let me see. I'm looking back through mine and the underwriter. So the policy will cancel October 29th. If they don't have proof of the water shut off system or, um, I mean if you're not getting one, then we're going to have to move this whole account. But I can't. I can't promise anything cheaper. At all. Yeah. That's the thing. Like it's and you're going to have to go through another home inspection again. But definitely on the the auto, and really on the home, I I won't be able to get anything cheaper because this was the cheaper option. The only thing on the home, it was like 2, 000 and that was with auto owners. And even with the auto, if I move that one to auto owners too, I mean you're still looking at, you know, probably about 1, 500. Okay. Yeah, I'm I was thinking. When I got that notice, so it's not actually canceled as right now. I was thinking that that was just automatically canceled and we didn't. No. Homeowners insurance or auto insurance. No, no, no. No, the auto insurance is fine. But I mean, you'll be able to. I mean. The auto insurance is fine. That that doesn't affect anything on the auto. It's just a home, but the home is prepared to cancel on 1029. So we either get a water shut off system installed, um, and keep the policy, or I'm going to have to move it to a different company and that's going to have to be move home and auto again. Um and then you're going to have a higher price or if you and Michael want to look at other companies. Um that's that's okay too because I can tell you what you have is the cheapest. I can't go. I can't find anything lower than that. Okay. Um. All right. Well. Um. At least that's a little bit. I don't know. I guess I read that policy wrong. I mean, read the letter wrong thinking that oh no they just automatically is automatically canceled and I said oh here I am without car insurance or home homeowners insurance immediately. So you have so the auto insurance is fine. It will stay active. The home insurance is what is planning on canceling at 1029. Okay. And. Okay. So that's. And what they really do want is I mean, I just looked up what automatic water shut off was. I mean that they want something that that is is. Detects if there's more water being used and it automatically shuts the water off. Is that? Is that what they're wanting? It's a flow based automatic water shut off system. So basically, if it detects a leak somewhere, it's going to cut the water off. It's supposed to help. Um. You know. Eliminate another claim because you have a leak somewhere in your. You know in the house. Right. I understand. Okay. And I did have I can send you the email. I sent it over to Michael as well. It gives you the underwriter actually gave a list of different. Kinds of water shut off systems. That's about one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. There's nine different ones that you can look at. Okay. And is it something that has to be installed or is it something that somebody just a layperson can do? Um.
