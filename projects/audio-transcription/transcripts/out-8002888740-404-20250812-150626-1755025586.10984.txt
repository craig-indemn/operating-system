Thank you for calling Auto Owners. This is Laura. How may I assist you? Hey Laura, this is Heather with Alliance Insurance. I am calling on billing account one zero two. Four nine four six eight zero. What's your name again? This is Heather Johnson. One second here. And confirm your agency code. One five zero three nine four zero zero. What can I do for you? So I wanted to see if there's any way that we can waive the fifteen dollars fee on this one. It does look like an agency error because she was requested to be put back on AutoPay and we failed to get that done. So now we are cancel pending for today. So I just wanted to see if that's a possibility or no. Let me see here. Um. So it looks like we waived a fee back in. Where did it go? Oh, in in May. Yep, I see it. Yeah, do you know why we or why that one that bill was canceled or didn't get paid? I should say. Um, I am not sure. It looks like the payment failed when it was on AutoPay. Um. So this might have just been them trying to. To make it right with a reinstatement. If you can't waive it, it's a big deal. I will call and let her know. I'm just trying because it says my system it didn't say that it was waived by a billing rep. We're only allowed to waive one fee through the whole year. So that's why I'm like sitting here and looking. I'm like. Yeah. Yeah. I'll I'll I'll waive it. This time it's only the fifteen dollars, isn't it right? The. Yeah. Because it looks like there's a fifteen dollars billing fee, so we'll just waive the late fee, which is that fifteen dollars one, and leave the billing raised. Okay. Your name is Lori, right? No, my name's Heather. Oh, okay. Yep. Okay, not that wait for you. That sounds great. Thank you for your time. You're welcome. Have a great day. You too. Bye.
