Thank you for holding. This is Holly. How can I help you? Holly, this is Betty Udd, and I want to talk to you about my premium on my policy. Okay, what's your address, Betty? Eight fifty three Jonathan Drive, Logan, North Carolina. All righty, I gotcha. Um, all right, I'm getting that renewal pulled up. Looks like it's going to renew on the thirty first. Uh huh. Okay, what question you got? Well, I've said in accordance with the North Carolina, the premium based upon the approved rate in North Carolina. For this is sixteen twenty eight and you have charged me eighteen ninety four and I wonder if I could get a reduction. Okay, we can look at it. All right, so on the renewal, the dwelling coverage is up thirty three thousand five hundred. Making the replacement cost three hundred and twenty one thousand. Go in here. Okay, so as far as the premium itself, you know I can't go in and just change the premium, but we can look at a couple things. Your deductible is at a thousand. Would you want me to quote it going up to twenty five hundred to see if that helps? How much difference would that make? You figure that out. Let me see. That would be, wild thing to do. Okay, going up to a twenty five hundred dollar deductible. That would take off two ninety four. It would make the annual sixteen hundred. So that would be my premium. Yep, sixteen hundred for the year if we increase it to twenty five hundred dollar deductible. Well, I think that. You know if you have a CD or something, you could use that and. I would I would save how much two hundred. Two ninety four. Okay. So if it's three or four years, that would you would save money would you. You would yeah. Mhm. And a lot of times, um. We're we're saying like the you know the new, um twenty five hundred is like the new thousand because with today's market you know it doesn't take a whole lot to get to a thousand so a lot of times if it's under a thousand you might not even file a claim anyway you know. Right. Okay, I'm okay. I understand that. All right, sixteen hundred premium. Yes, ma'am. For a year. Save almost three hundred dollars. Mhm. Three years would be almost nine hundred dollars. Would be nine hundred dollars. Let's see. Okay. Is this do I have a coverage for hurricane tornado? Yeah, that's under the deductible the twenty five hundred. Okay. Would you do it? Do you think I should. Um, I personally have a twenty five hundred dollar deductible, but it's totally up to you. Whatever your preference. You personally have one. I do. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Well, can we do it that way then? If you do and you you work there with everybody. And you do it yourself, so I think it would be all right. Okay, I can get it changed for you. So it will take a couple days for it to process and then you'll get the revised documents. Um. And the billing will update in a few days too. Okay, and it will come to my post office. My address here in North Carolina, woman. It will. Yeah. Okay. Then I'll wait on that. Okay. All righty, I will go ahead and process it for you. Okay. Anything else for now? I think it sounds good. Uh, okay. I thought about putting my my my Florida car. In with my premium, I mean, in with my insurance there. I wonder if that would save me some money. Well, well. I guess I have to. I know I have to change it. Have the title changed and everything to get that done. Exactly. Yep, that's what I'm getting ready to say. If it's titled and tagged in Florida, you need to change it to North Carolina. Then we could definitely. Well, let me ask you one more thing. If my title's down into Florida house and I want to change it up here to North Carolina address. Can they pull that up on the internet and find out my title? Can they do that? Or do I have to have the original title when I go to the tag place? I would think you have to have the title in hand. See when you go trade a car, you don't take your title with you. You can trade that day. Yeah, honestly, I'm not one hundred percent sure. I would think you had would have to have it, but again, I'm not one hundred percent sure. Okay. And just to give you an idea here, adding the multi policy discount. Let's see, it was two ninety four. What's the deductible? It would save another one hundred ninety two a year on the home. Almost two
