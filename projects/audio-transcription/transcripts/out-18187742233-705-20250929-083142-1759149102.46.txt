Good morning, I see I'm calling. Hey good morning Mario, this is Joe with Alliance Insurance. How are you sir? Good, how you doing? Hey, I'm doing great. Just touching base with you. You know I've been out of town for a little bit, getting back in the saddle. We'll just see how things are going. I know our team had communicated with you while I was gone. How's everything going? So far so good. I'm just waiting for the attorney to let me know what's going on, and I can't put insurance on until I'm ready to know that they're going to sell the place or not. Is that the overs and or anything? Okay. Has that become in question whether they was going to sell it or not? Well, I'm still waiting for the owner to. It was supposed to close at the tenth of October. Right. Okay, but it hasn't even the guy hasn't not moved anything in the place. So I don't even know what's going on. His attorney, I don't know if he got contact with the with the gentleman that hired. I got you. Okay, well just know Mario that we're obviously we're here to support you. We got this thing teed up and ready for you. Typically, and I know this is kind of new to you, but typically when you're purchasing property, especially when you have a loan, the attorney. There's no no no money involved. I'm sorry, no. Okay, well well disregard it. I disregard. I stand corrected. I was just going to let you know that usually the underwriters and all the people involved want to see the property insured prior to the closing date. But you you may be able to forego all of that hassle. Okay. But the thing the thing is there's no escrow companies here, so everything has to go through an attorney. That's why I found out. That's the reason why I was I'm doing my footwork of being all the all those stuff together. I got you understand. Soon as I know that that we're going to sign paperwork, then I go get the insurance so that everything is all up and up, and so that you know I don't have no issues coming in. Okay, understand. Well, that's why Mister Robbie sent me to you to get the quote, get everything set up, so that when it's ready to do, then I can say okay here it is, here's your money, set it all up. Yep, I like it. Sounds good advice to me. Yeah, those those proposals are typically good for 30 days. So we're in good standings there. Just touch base with us when you get ready. You know, obviously give us a day or two heads up, and yeah, we'll sit down and go over everything. Yeah, I just don't know what what the situation is with with the gentleman. Yeah, I understand. It's how these things go sometimes. Yeah, these things are up and down sometimes. We're we're accustomed to that side of it. So you you let us know, I'll put a reminder in here maybe week and a half next week sometime to give you a call back just to touch base. But yeah, we're happy to help whenever the time's ready. Okay, sir. Thank you very much. Have a great day. Thank you, sir. Take care. Bye bye.
