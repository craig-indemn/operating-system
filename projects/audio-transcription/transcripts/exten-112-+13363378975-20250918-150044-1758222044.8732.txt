Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hi, Brandi. This is Caleb. Just returning your call. Hey Caleb, yes, um, we got a notice that the home and auto policy was canceled with auto owners. Um, did you switch to a different company? Yes, ma'am. Okay, who did you end up going with? If you don't mind me asking. Uh, what was a personal friend that worked in the area? Oh, okay, no problem. Um, did you get a was it because of a lower price or just because you knew the person? Lower price. Okay, all right. Um, we just wanted to double check and make sure. Um, I did see that there is a refund check from the home coming back to you. That was sent out. Um. Let's see, it was actually sent out today, so I would figure that you get it in the next two weeks. If you don't, let us know, and we can track that down for you. Um, the amount is two thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars and thirty two cents. Okay. Okay, wonderful. Thanks so much. Yeah, you're welcome. I hope you have a great day. Thanks. Bye.
