Hello. Hi, is Alicia available? Who is she? Hi, it's Tracy calling from Alliance Insurance. Hello. Hey, want to let you know, auto owners was having trouble getting that new policy issued out, so they just lifted the non renewal on the current one and just left everything in place. Okay, well actually I meant to call you guys earlier, but forgot when I got started work. I got I was able to get one yesterday through another place cheaper so I don't need. Oh goodness. I can keep the homeowners one, but I don't need that one. Okay, gotcha. Um, do you know what day they made it effective? Um, yesterday. It was yesterday. Okay, and can I ask who gave you the better rate? Um, I it was through my mom's agent, but it was National National General and the one that you guys quoted me from them was four hundred and something and the one I got from them was two twenty six. A month. Yes. Oh, that's weird. Normally they match, huh? Let's check that out. Weird. Okay, what we need to do is send you a form to sign that allows us to cancel the auto owners policy. Okay, and then once I we get that back, we can get that processed for you. All right, thank you. You're welcome. Have a great day. You too. Thanks. Bye bye.
