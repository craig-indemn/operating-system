Hello. Hi, this is JC with the Lions Insurance giving you a call back. We spoke some time earlier this month. I think it was last week. I am sorry in September regarding the claim and I was just checking in to see how that was going for you. Well, he called us Friday and said y'all had denied it. So what exactly happened? What what did they say? I asked him. I said he said. He said it was a mechanical. What was it mechanical? Mechanical, but he couldn't tell me what it was and the the RV person don't understand why they denied it. Were you able to get in touch? Yeah, but were you able to get in touch with the adjuster to have that discussion with with them? Well, I talked to him and he hung up on me. So. Were you able to give them a call? He told us Friday. He told us Friday that he had talked to the the guy that's working on it. Okay. That it would go before a board of people to determine it and thirty minutes later, callback said it was denied. So he said it was mechanical. I said, "What what do you mean it's mechanical? I mean, what what is that?" He just said it was mechanical. I said, "What can you describe that?" And I guess he got here because I was questioning about it. So he hung up on me. Okay. Well, you still have the right to know what exactly he means by it was mechanical. I can send out an email and have him contact you again. To discuss further if you are not content with the answer he gave you he or she gave you. Yeah, you know the the kept asking we don't know. You get asked if we had a lightning strike. Well, we don't know. I don't know what happened. The building house is up here. They cut our power all the time to do stuff. Okay. Yeah, we've never had any problem. We've never made any claim. We're progressive all the years we've had. It's just we had a surge protector on. We've done everything we know to protect everything. You know it's older model, but we take good care of it and it's just. Right. And yeah, wait. We talked to people who pay less for their insurance on their RV than what we pay. And I know every year it gets older and older, but we still basically say the same price every year. So I don't know. We just we just really put out with everything because understandable. I don't know. I guess I don't know. We just we went ahead told the guy to fix it because we got a trip plan and. Right. I did. I do remember that you had a trip planned and you wanted to have it done before then. Like I said, I can contact Progressive and see if we can get in touch with that adjuster for for them to give you a call back to give a better explanation of it being mechanical. I am so sorry that you had that that adjuster hang up on you. I am not really sure what happened on there and we don't have a lot of contact with the claims department. We are calling the follow up to see how the claim is going. Would you like for me to try to get the adjuster to give you a call back? Well, if he can, if he can, I don't know. Explain it any different. I don't know. Like I said, we talked to the man fixing it. He don't understand it. He said they don't usually have that kind of problem when they have something like that. I mean, he's the one that told us that apparently there was a surge at some point and. Then he kept asking, "We had a lightning strike." Well, you know if we had a lightning strike, we live in a wooded area. So. But I know cutting the power and coming back on. Like I said, they're building a whole new development up above our house and they. Right. Introduced come out here and said about twenty lines and cut our tree in half. Got a lot going on over there. Yeah, but like I said, we've never all the years never had any problem with before and and. It was it was fine until probably a five day period that something happened. I gotcha. Yeah, so the adjuster is the one that goes out and does the investigating to see exactly what happened and then they determine whether it. Is covered or not? I won't be able to explain further. What he means by it's a mechanical issue. Yeah, the the RV guy said that when he talked to him, he thought that everything was going to go through okay and then like I said, it didn't so. But I cannot say how it would go before a board. I think is what he said. They determined it wasn't thirty minutes
