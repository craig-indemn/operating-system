This is Rick. Hi, Rick. My name is Ashley. I'm calling from Heritage Mortgage. I was wondering if you could help us on a crime and fidelity fidelity policy. Let me just let me let me interrupt you for a second. I just hung up the phone with Laura, the broker. I've just I've been involved in this email conversation. I apologize. It has been an endless email thread. Sometimes a phone call does a lot better. So here's what I'm going to tell you about this situation. First of all, we're in North Carolina. Okay, we do not have a statute in the state of North Carolina like somebody thinks we do. That makes this mandatory. Our homeowners associations. It was it was proposed back in 2021. It never made it out of our legislative committee. So the statute does not exist. I've talked to our attorney about it. That doesn't exist. My understanding, however, is that you don't particularly care if it's a statute or not. You're telling me that you want the coverage in place. Regardless. It's a Fannie Mae. It's Fannie Mae. That's fine. I'm not going. I'm not going to argue Fannie Mae with you. I'm just I'm just trying to be clear. The impression that we got. Hey, this is a state law and your your customers in violation of it. That sort of hurt everybody. And that's not the case. So. Yeah, no, I didn't say that. I'm just saying it's a Fannie Mae guideline. We've been asking our insurance carrier Westfield Insurance, who is on the Master Association's policy here for several years. Can we obtain in North Carolina? Can we are they filed to provide this designated agent endorsement onto the crime policy that's in place? The crime policy exists. It does not have that rider. It does not have that endorsement in place. I don't know. Frankly, I don't know if they have it available in North Carolina or not. It it you know insurance carriers they have to file with the insurance commissioner's office all the forms that they want to write and if they never use that form in North Carolina we may not be able to get it on this policy. Okay. So we've asked. We continue to ask. The the the timing here with a Christmas closing was just unfortunate. People are out. People are behind on emails. We have been asking and asking and asking. Just like you guys have been. I know you want to close it. We want to be helpful. But we are at the mercy of another writer who's been out on vacation and her backup has been out on vacation and so it's just. We just need to get an answer right this minute and we've been we really have been trying for for a week now to get an answer from someone. Is this endorsement even available? And if so, what is it going to cost? Because at some point you know if there's an additional cost to this somebody's got to be willing to accept that and and pay the premium. Right. And those types of changes we can't change a policy because a lender asks us to change it. We have to make the conversation with our named insured. We finally got that request this morning. Okay, so that was really the first request that we had from a named insured on the policy to make a change to the policy or to find out if they can make a change. So that is part of the delay. So so what I can tell you is we've asked we've asked multiple times today. I've been on the email threads with the underwriter. Both Anna and myself have have have emailed. I've actually called and left a voicemail. Got it. Left had to leave a message for this underwriter. So as soon as we know okay that this endorsement is or is not available, we will you you might be the second person though I feel like the first person though will probably be Mr. Dobbins but I think the second person is probably going to be you. So working on it. I I wish we could just wave a magic magic wand and and have a and have this solved for you but unfortunately there was a lot of moving parts to it and so so I just wanted to be be clear with what the delay was. I appreciate that you know there's not there's not a statutory requirement here. If you're telling me it's a Fannie Mae requirement because this person is only making a an 8% down payment versus a 9% down payment. They're making a three person. Yeah. So if they were making 10% or more, it would be a limited condo review for Fannie and Fannie doesn't even look at the crime when it's limited. But when it's full, they require it. I get it and I understand that those are not requirements that you are able to to modify or waive
