Hello. Hey Axel, this is Corbin with the Lions Insurance. How you doing? Good. Hey um, I know they've been talking to you about getting proof of roof of age roof age. Do you have that? Anything that shows how old the roof is. Otherwise, they might make it older, pay a little more. Okay um, let me get right back to you and give you a call back um. I reached out to the previous homeowner because I just recently bought the house. Yeah, I figured. Yeah, see, see what you can find out there and um. Was there sometimes it's on the disclosure statement too when you buy it? It's on I forgot what page it's on. But there's it's written on there like any improvement and all that stuff. So see, see if you can find that um and just let me know otherwise they're going to. They're going to change it, but it's going to go up some. Not crazy, but. Um, I just need proof of if we can just find something that will help. Okay, and you said sometimes it might be on the disclosure. Yeah, on that disclosure. Okay. You just kind of got to look through it. You know, it describes the home and all the particulars. So. Yeah. Okay. All right, let me know Axel. Thanks so much. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Bye bye.
