Corbin, may help you. Hey Corbin, John Campbell, how are you? Hey, what's up, John? I just got my new insurance bill. It went up thirty some hundred dollars, so I am over nine grand for four vehicles. Can you can you start looking around for me and see what else is out there? Yeah, of course. Let me pull it up here. Yeah, the auto went from forty nine sixty five to eighty seven sixty nine. Wonder what happened there. Was it? Ticket accident or something. Yeah, Caleb had a had an accident. Oh. And then the home sixteen sixty to twenty two seventy one. And then umbrella four four to five thirty three. Okay. So it looks like the auto is the the culprit. Yeah, let me do some checking. I run these on the seventeenth. The only other carrier I would recommend would be. What the points? Let's see. The homeowners. Yeah, what if hmm? I've have to do some checking here. Yeah, I'll run some rates. Um. To see. Yeah, why did why did homeowners go up? That seems weird. Yeah, they they've been going up because of the. Rate increases in North Carolina. Um. And the coverage amount went up too, but I just have to let me take a look and then um, let's plan on talking later. Um. I'll get some rates. I'll run the rates with all the carriers and see where out with everything and then we can kind of. Play around with the numbers and get it down some. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Is it uh? Yeah, is there any way to kick Caleb off on his own coverage? Well, we could discuss it. The only problem with those is that if you got Caleb on a single car policy, it wouldn't get the multi car, the homeowner. Or the good credit discount that you guys have, so it's typically about forty percent higher to go on their own. Um. Doesn't say that parents don't do that, but. Um, but it's it's just a more of an expensive you are still paying it. It's got a. Yeah, what I'll run rates and I'll kind of give you some options and let you know. The best scenario. All right, sounds good. I appreciate. All right, thanks, John. Talk to you soon. Bye bye.
