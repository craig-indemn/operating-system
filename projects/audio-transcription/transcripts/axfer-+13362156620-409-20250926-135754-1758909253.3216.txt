Corbin, good afternoon Corbin. This is Lee Combsdown in Thomasville. How are you doing? Hey, good. How about yourself? Oh, no complaints. Good. Um, it's been a while since we talked, which is great. You know, it's not a problem. I just have a an off the wall question. I wanted to get your professional input on with regard to insurance on an automobile. Okay. Um, I've got three vehicles with you, and my oldest one is sort of a, you know, my just knock around vehicle. It's a a 2007 Lexus RX SUV, and. Obviously, I've just got basic insurance on it, which is fine. But our associate pastor at our church, his car broke down and he's got five kids all driving and and. Anyways, long story short, I told him I said, "Well, look, if yours is in the you know shop, you got to get a new transmission or something like that. You can use mine." Well, it's been a couple of weeks now, and I just got to thinking. Well, I didn't report to you guys, and I remembered my sons used to be listed whenever they were on our insurance policy. You know when they first started driving, and I thought, well, I would hate to think that you know, God forbid something would happen even it wasn't his fault. Would it create? Could it create problems? And so I just thought I'd give you a call and get your input. Yeah, so typically if it's a long term thing, you want to add him as a driver. You change the garageing address, but if it's not going to be too much longer, I wouldn't worry too much about it. Yeah, it's been a couple of weeks, and he said that they're finishing up. He expects one day next week to get it get his car back. Oh, you should be fine. It's a temporary thing. Because the insurance of the vehicle. Yeah, the insurance of the vehicle, not the driver. So. I understand. I just would hate to think that you know I didn't at least let you know that I can check and see. You know, just to make sure again, just in today's world. Things can be really screwy, and so I just wanted to make certain. Yeah, no problem. Thanks for checking. Um, but if it comes permanent or pretty consistent for another month or so, let's let's add him as a driver. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, but I don't expect that because I just talked to him yesterday and he said, "Yeah, they told me they're they're you know finishing it up, but they didn't know that they'd get finished before today and you know they don't want the weekend." So it'll probably be the same day, but if for some reason if he you know turns out that he's like, man, they're probably not going to be done next week. You know, I may let you know again just because that that would be a third third week or whatever, and I'd rather be rather be you know because he's driving it home you know and then come back to the church and make some visits to the hospitals. That's that's pretty much where he's going. Some exposure there, yeah, I understand. Exactly, and so I thought, well, you know, I I'm happy to to help him out, you know, especially we got a vehicle sitting there. But I thought, well, if it turns into a real problem, something, I say, look, just bring it back, and I'll rent you a car. You know, you can take your insurance. And right, you know, I want to help out when I can, but I also don't want to do something. I'm like, well, I wasn't very smart for my family, you know. Yeah, I got you. Yeah, so that's the that's the thing. But yeah, hey, and also I was saying, if you're ever down this way, I don't know whether you ever meet Tony Hyde or or not, but if you're ever around the Thomasville area or or sometime Tony now, since I have a chance to meet you, maybe we could we could you know take you to lunch or something. Yeah, yeah, I would love that. I love to meet you guys. Have you met? Have you actually met Tony? Yeah, a couple times. Yeah, okay, good, that's great. He's a great guy. I tell you, he's a real real friend. Yeah, he is. It's a good dude. Yes, indeed. Well, look, you got other stuff to do. I won't keep you. I just wanted to get a sanity check on that and make sure while I was sitting here just thinking
