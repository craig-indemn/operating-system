Hi, this is Tracy. Please read the message. At the tone, please record your message. When you've finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options. Hi there, Tracy. This is Jeremy at Alliance Insurance. I received a email notification that you were looking for a unique scenario of being able to have your own insurance. It was just you on the driver portion, and I just need to garner a bit more information from you. So what I've done is I've sent an email to you, and it's coming from Jeremy at myallianceinsurance dot com. Within that email, there is a link. If you click on that link and then log on to your current carrier for your home and auto, it will take and populate the coverages for me. Give me a copy of your coverages and the vendor numbers. The only other piece that I'll need will be your driver's license number and date of birth, which you can include on my email as well. So just be looking for that email and that'll help me get the process started. If you've got questions in the meantime, please give me a call directly at three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. That's three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thank you so very much, Tracy. I appreciate it, and I look forward to talking to you soon.
