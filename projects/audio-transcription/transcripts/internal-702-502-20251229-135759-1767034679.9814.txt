Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Rachel speaking, sorry I didn't mean 5 p.m. Okay, hi Rachel, this is Armando from Alliance Insurance. I'm a co worker. Mr. Madlock called and he said that is the deadline for the auto for the vehicle is 30 years. I don't know what he's referring to. He just wanted to tell you that. That you would know what he's talking about. He just stepped out of the DMV. And the deadline is 30 years. Okay. So the 93 he didn't have to have it inspected correct. I I don't know all he said is tell her that it's 30 years after it's been inspected and that's it. He didn't get any. Any information and the phone number that he gave me that came in through the call was not a number with. You know with with the information I could give you the number if you want to talk to him. It was uh Larry Madlock. Yeah yes. Okay yeah that's fine he said he would let me know so that's fine so evidently he didn't have to have it inspected because I finally found it on DMV website. If it's over 30 years old that it did not have to have. Inspection right. I appreciate you call me though. You're welcome have a wonderful holiday man. Thanks you too uh huh. Bye.
