Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Brandi, this is the business I called you earlier. Yes. I gave you my email address, but it's last D eighty at Gmail GM dot com. Okay, so it's your last name D eight zero at Gmail dot com. My last name is last L A S H. Right, so it's L A. Go ahead. No, you go ahead. L A S H comma D E E. Eighty at Gmail dot com. At Gmail. Yeah. Dot com. Okay, that email address doesn't work. It's saying that it's not a not an email. Well, really, so the GF got mail is DM. Right, it's so it's saying that that email doesn't work. Are you sure there's a comma in it? Because normally they don't let you do that. It's a comma between last and D. Well, on my end, it's not my system's not letting me send that as an email. Well, I don't understand. But, but try last D. Uh. Eighty, maybe comma at Gmail. Dot com. Yeah, without the comma at all, it will let me send it. It will. Without the comma, yes. So you don't have to have a comma to send it. I don't think there's a comma there. Okay. Yeah, typically in an email address, they won't let you put any other, um, anything else in there. Well, just try last D. Just try last D eighty at dot at Gmail dot com. Okay, let me see if this works. Please. You can see if you want to feel like helping you out with that. You can feel good and look at yourself. Sorry, you so good, Gene. Oh, I'm writing a eulogy for Doug. You know to add some stupid memorial today. I really want to do a good job.
