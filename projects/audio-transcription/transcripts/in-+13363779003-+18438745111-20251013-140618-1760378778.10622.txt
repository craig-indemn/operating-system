Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Ah yes, ma'am. I called two hours ago. I was trying to try to get a hold of Gary. He sent me a form. I sent him a message and email, um, but he has not gotten in contact with me. I'm trying to get this thing signed by the close of business. Okay. Well, let me see if I can get him for you now. Just one moment. All right. Thank you. You're welcome.
