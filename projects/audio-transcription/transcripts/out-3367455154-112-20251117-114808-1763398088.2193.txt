Frank Harris. Hey Frank, this is Brandy with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Good. How are you doing? Good. Um, I was giving you a call to see if you had time to review over the policies that we have for you. Sure. Okay. Um. Just wanted to. Go over contact information first. So I have you as the primary contact. Is that correct? Correct. All right, and then your mailing address is 800 Golf Course Road in Pilot Mountain. Correct. All right, and then, um, your email address is f harris at new. Um. Dash Atlantic dot net. Correct.

All right, and then we have her email address is j dot a u m a n dot harris at gmail dot com. Correct. All right. All right. I'm going to get your homeowners policy pulled up first. And before I start anything, do you have any questions for me? I do not. Okay. Um. So we are going to you know do this review once a year. Um. It may not be around the time that your renewal is coming up or not. Um. It's just going to be a once a year, um type thing to review over coverages and make sure that nothing has changed. Um or anything that we might be able to help you with. So with a homeowners policy, um. We have. Hmm. Come on. Sorry, my computer is going a little slow this morning. All right. So for the coverage on the home itself, is 984 thousand. So that's what it would take to rebuild your home. Do you think that's enough coverage for the home itself? Yes. Okay, and then below that you do have other coverages. Um. It it's all a certain percentage of that 984 thousand. You have. Coverage B, which is other structures anything that's not attached to the home. Um. Your personal property in or outside the home minus vehicles. Um. That is 688, 800. Um. You can change that number. You can decrease it or increase it. Um and then you also have loss of use. So if something were to happen to the home, and your home is not livable, you have 196, 800 to stay somewhere else while repairs are being made. Um. You you also have personal liability, which is at 500,000. That is to protect you if some if you are held liable. Um and then you also have medical payments, which is 5,000 per person. This is anyone that does not live in the household. It's just someone like a guest that comes over. Or somebody. A friend, um, any anybody like that just no one that lives in the household. If they get hurt on the property in or outside, you can give them 5,000 from your homeowners policy to take care of any medical payments. Um as needed. Um. You do also have your deductible. Um you have, 2,000 for wind and hail. Um if you need to file a claim, you pay the 2,000 for anything that involves wind or hail. Um anything else would be a, a thousand dollar deductible. Um. See. I have. I have your roof year as 2010, but it looks like your home was constructed in 2006. Um has your roof been updated at all since that house was built? Okay. I'm just going to leave it as is because we don't want anything changing with your premium. Um. All right, and just a few questions. Um. Do you rent your home out to anybody? No. Okay, and do you run a business out of the home? No. All right, and there are two coverages that we do want to let people know that are not covered under the homeowners policy, and that is flood and earthquake. Flood is a separate policy. And earthquake, you can add on to your policy. I think I'm good. All right, and. And let me see. All right, and it looks like we have a mortgage on your homeowners policy. Is that correct? What. Do you have a mortgage on your home? Still. Yes. Okay. Let me pull this up and make sure I verify it. Okay, we have Truist Bank as your mortgagee. Is that correct? That's correct. Okay. All right, and now going to move on to we. It looks like we have a renters policy, um under your account. Um. Let me see. For Chase at 4100 Creekside Ridge Avenue Unit 138D in Raleigh
