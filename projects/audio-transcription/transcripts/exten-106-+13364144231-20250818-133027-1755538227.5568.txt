Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. This is Jessica. Can help you. Hey Jessica, this is Monica at Better Way Automotive. How are you? Good. How are you, Monogram? Good, good. I'm trying to get a copy of our policy for our secured interest. I got a copy of our policy, but it does not have our dealer's lot coverage on the policy. Okay, give me one. Let me get you pulled up here. Okay. Did Gloria send over the certificate already? I think she sent it over because um, but I do not see it on there unless I'm missing it. Okay. And which is this secured finance company? What's it called? It. There's two of them. We should have three on there in total. Let me get that information pulled up. One of them is Casey, Casey S and Next Gear. So let's see. Looks like I have Flexpath Capital on here. Let me see if Next Gear is on here. Next Gear. I don't see Next Gear, but we can definitely get that added. Okay, we need Next Gear and there's Casey S floor plans as well. Okay, let's see. Okay, so Casey S floor plan that's the one. I think they already have an email um that has their information. But let me double check. Uh huh. Yeah, I see it here. Let me see if we have Next Gear's. Next Gear. Okay, I do believe I found Next Gear as well. Okay, give me a few minutes. Let me get that added on here and I'll email it over to you. And what I'm assuming Gloria sent it to us. I do not see our dealer's lot policy on here unless I'm overlooking it because these policies I'm not familiar with. But I do not see the dealer's lot coverage on here. On their certificate yes. Okay, let me look at it and see if maybe she did forget to get that added on there. Okay. Okay, give me a few minutes to um get the the two added on and then I'll review the certificate. But I'll send you the back page once it's ready. Okay, great. Um, should I have that within like the next hour or so? I just need to update my boss. Okay. Listen that yeah. Okay, great, great, great. Thank you so much. Bye. Thanks.
