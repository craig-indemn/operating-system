Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, this is Mary Pearson. And I'm calling in to pay my insurance. Okay, let me get a pull up here for you. The auto policy with auto owners. Okay. Okay, showing you owe one twenty three twenty nine. Let's see. Are you going to pay it with a card? Okay, let me get over to my other website. Take me just a moment. Okay, and I've got a visa on file that ends in five five eight one. Okay. So I'll put your email address in that way they can email you the confirmation. Do you want it to go to the Gmail account or the Yahoo account? Okay, you just want the Gmail. Okay. They will send it to you. Is there anything else I can help with? Okay. Well, you have a good day. Well, you're welcome. And bye.
