Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. This is Cecilia. How can I help you? Hey Cecilia, this is Tim with Sharp Business. How are you today? I'm good. Thank you. How are you? Doing good. I've got the calling in regards to getting your copier set up for the automated meter and toner reporting. Yes. So now now it's a good time to work with you on that. It is. What do we need to do? All right. Well, if I can get remote access to a computer, what I'll do is I'll get all the software and settings fixed so it will start reporting again. You want I can give you the site remote site. Let me know when you're ready. Okay. Go ahead. Okay, the site is sos dot splashtop dot com. It should take you straight to the IT site. Should automatically download this Blastop SOS app depending on the browser. Once that is downloaded, we will go ahead and run it. It will go through a secure connection and then give you a nine digit key. Let's try. Okay, I have a code. All right, ready for it. Six one five three five four nine one six. Perfect. Thank you. All right, there's connecting back to me. Did you say you're going to have to download a software or something like that? Possibly. A lot of times the copiers can send a email without having any software, but if it can't, then they'll have to be an agent, a monitoring agent added to to do the reporting. So let me see if I can get access to it first. Because it may be it may be a simple setting. This reason I was telling. Okay, well our computers are password protected and we don't have those admin passwords. To download software, so. Okay. If it gets to that point, then I can you know I can work with your administrator whoever's in charge of the. Six eight one dot twelve. Okay, so it's still the same address. That looks. I'm just comparing some of the setting the reports on my side as it's pulling across here. It's. Here. So that's at least get the a meter every day. There's a little bit tricky on the toner side of it. So give me just a second here to. See if I can get the toner reporting as well. If you need to put me on hold at any time, just tell me. You're good. All right, that should alert us on everything that we need. Okay. Yeah, I got it. I got it set up to email you when it's time to replace the cartridges. And the cartridges are low. I've also got it set to send us email when the cartridge is low. So hopefully we can get it ordered. Yeah, I was going to ask. So you guys order those and we get those in the mail when you get notification. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Yep, it should be sent to you soon within a couple of days of us getting the notification. Okay. Looks like everything is done. I'm going to close that, and we didn't need to put any software on there. Awesome. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
