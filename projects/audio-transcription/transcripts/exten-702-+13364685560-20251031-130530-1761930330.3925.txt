Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. This is Rachel. May help you. Hey Rachel, how you doing? I'm fine. How are you? It's Clifford. Yeah, I just told and let you know. Generally on Friday we come down, but our checks didn't come today. I guess they'll probably come Monday. They'll be fine. Monday will be fine. Okay. Will you? Will you be in office Monday? Yes. Okay. Lord willing, I will be. Okay. How's Diane? But she's doing pretty good. Sort of the therapist sort of took off a walker yesterday and got on a cane now, and so she's getting around. Yeah. That's good news. That's good news. Well, that's I'm glad to hear that. But Monday Monday will be fine, Clifford. Clifford, are you there? Clifford. Clifford.
