Good morning. This is Jessica. Hey Jessica, this is Maggie. I called you yesterday for the neighbor's brother. Yes, I still haven't gotten the policy number. I am waiting for it, but they did say this morning when I got here at eight that they would send it over shortly. Oh no, I understand, but no, I was not calling you for that. Okay. I actually wanted to ask your question. If you do incident reports. Incident reports. Yeah, like when the like let's say like the company has an incident, and you know how we have to do reports and everything. Yeah, I was wondering if you do those things. Trying to say everything. So the. If there is only claim, so this is what I'll tell you what we can do or what can be done. If something were to happen, you can let the insurance company know that oh this person got hurt. They're not filing anything but just letting you know that this happened. And then of course you can file a claim fully, but incident reports I don't think I've heard of that. No, no, because it's not nothing that we want to claim. It's just something the company was asking for. Because you know nothing like it was like a fall thing. I am not sure, but but they they had called us in and they said that they wanted an incident report. But they said that usually the insurance agent usually like they can help you out, but some don't. Like because they want it like professionally done like the P P T S I mean P T S or something I am not sure. That's what I've heard of that. So so has so nothing has happened. It's just a report that they want you to. It's because I am not sure like one hundred percent sure what happened. But as a subcontractor, I guess the the owner of it Miguel has to do an incident report. But they taught us like they were teaching us how to do it like. But they said that you know some agents help you and some don't so that's why I was asking. It's like a just a report of like of what happened. And it's just printed out and then we sign it and I don't know what. And then. What would be on that report? Since nothing has happened, like I thought. I would assume if you haven't had any incidents that you wouldn't have to generate something. Oh okay, it was an I think an incident that one of the guys fell off. Yeah, something like that. But this is. It was in the beginning of the year. No, but it wasn't. I don't think they had your insurance yet. Is it the claim that you had with Builders Mutual? No, no. Okay, did you guys file a claim for this? No, we didn't. Okay. It's because he he was he was attached like he you know how they tied up and like with the. Yeah, he was attached and everything. So like he had just fell off. But they told us you know they didn't have. I mean I've never done one before. I can try to help if you want to email it over to me if you have the form. I could just review it and let you know. But yeah, I've never I've never come across that before. Okay. Yeah, because I guess they just wanted. I don't know. They they were just telling us, and and I am like maybe I could ask her to see if she does that so she can help us. Yeah. Yeah, send it over. Um and we can look at it and let you know. And because they they want also like a fall protection plan. That is something you can create. I would recommend using Chat GPT for that actually. Yeah, that's what they were telling you. They're like that. Just you know copy and paste, but like don't just change some words up. That's what they told us. Yeah, and I would say to of course like maybe take good time to go over it with your employees and ask Chat GPT to give you something for your employees to sign saying that they understand the things that you have reviewed with them. Okay. Okay. So you think it's just better for me just to do it or. Do you have the form? Is it a form form they were supposed to because they didn't send me no form they just told me that I have to do it. For the are you you are talking about the. The incident report. Yeah, for that yeah because I I don't I wouldn't know where to where to start to get that form. It was just okay. It was just like I think it was just a letter that we have to write. Like a summary that we've done one before. No. No. Oh okay. Yeah, but he was just. Let me Google it or see if I can
