Sorry, hold. This is Cody. May help you. Hey Cody, this is Claudia. I hope you had a merry Christmas. Yes, ma'am. I did. How about you? Oh, it was lovely, quiet, relaxing. Didn't travel this time. Okay. I leave the. Sometimes. Well, I always tell the boys that they need to spend. They need to be home. The kids, the grandbabies, need to be home and have Christmas and. And all that, and stuff, and we'll we'll see them in the new year. And stuff. Hey, I got your email, and I'm going to look into the search. I don't know who has to fix this or what the problem is, but I will make sure it gets to whoever needs to handle it and everything. I. I know when when I search it, it brings up both policies issued. Why one says bindable, the other? Um, because I just did it. On my side, and when it comes up, it shows. Mister Carports LLC. I have two policies issued and. Um. There there's a quote out there, but I show two issued. So I don't know. Yeah, and I. It'll randomly find it. I guess, but here lately it like will not find it. Period. It just finds like the old one quoted or whatever because I think you have two issued one with a different policy number. Like. Right. It will. I'm just going to search it again just to see. Yeah, I see one issued. Yeah, I I I got your screenshot, so I'm going to figure out who this needs to go to and. Have them. Same thing again this time. It just shows the issued package, the in progress, other one, and the bindable other one. Bindable. Which should be issued. There should be two issued policies. And everything, so I'm I'm going to send this on to whoever. I'm going to find out who needs to see this and then I'll send it on to them. But there was one other thing I wanted to tell you. That effective January 1st, they are moving me. I will not be your underwriter anymore. Oh no. I I'm not I and and I'm I'm not even calling you on the line. I'm supposed to call you on because I don't want them recording it because. I'm pissed that I'm being moved, and they gave me some bullshit answer. Excuse my French. You can cuss all over with me. They gave me some bullshit on why I'm going to Georgia and handling. Georgia agents versus staying where I was, and I'm not happy about it at all. But I wanted to call and tell you before you get the email, which they're supposed to be sending them out. Because it says change is supposed to be effective 11, but I'm in no way happy about. This. Everything. Just to move you from one territory to another. Oh, because their answer to me was that they needed a strong underwriter in Georgia and Georgia's growing so much. That's bullshit. They have. Two strong underwriters in Georgia, and yes, Georgia needed some more people, but it didn't have to be me. Yeah, I mean, why do you have to move it? They. Territory just because they need people there. I mean. No, they they didn't have. The real issue was there was somebody in Georgia who didn't want to be there who. Bitched and moan and complained enough that they took the changes they were going to make to my territory so that I would. Have. I would have more business that I would be looking at and handling. They took the plan that was laid out for me, gave it to her and moved me to her territory and. So the Georgia. Lives in up here. Sounds like. Yeah, she no yeah she's. Lives in yeah. Yeah, and I was pissed. You know, and they won't say. I wish they would have just been honest why they did what they did instead of giving me some bullshit answer because. It's all bullshit. I I I don't care what, and I'm just like okay. I'm like all right. I got a feeling you're going to be leaving Westfield pretty soon. Uh huh. I I'm like okay. My opinion. I wasn't asked. I was just told. Okay. And that's the wrong way to go about it. I mean, you've been doing this for what 30 some years or something. Oh, we're on the side of 40 now. Okay. So I. You know. I mean, I didn't want to. Yeah, yeah. And that's okay. I'm not no shame in my game and the whole bit. But I just wanted to call you so that when you
