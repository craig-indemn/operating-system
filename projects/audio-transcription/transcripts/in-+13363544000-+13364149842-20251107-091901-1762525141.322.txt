Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hey, this is Randy Sidnort. Hey, could you check on your computer and see if I was charged twice on my my insurance premium? I wrote a check and it looked like I had a a withdrawal from the bank too. Is it for home or autos? Everything, my whole package. It was twenty six hundred, I think. Okay, let's see what we got here. Because I came in the office and brought a check. And I think I saw something in my my bank statement. Let's see, it's showing. It was a payment made October second for the two thousand six hundred seven dollars. But it's not showing anything else. Because it's not showing like an excess that like it's been overpaid. Okay, then maybe it wasn't. Does that show that? It was a check in the office. Does it show it was a a a bank withdrawal from my account? No, it doesn't. It doesn't say that. It just shows that it was paid with your checking account. Okay, so it could be either one then. Yeah, but it's a yeah on their end. It is just showing one payment. From what I can see, it's not showing like an excess of any amount. All right, I'll check my bank records again then. Okay. That's it. Okay, well you have a good day. Hi, thank you. You're welcome. Bye.
