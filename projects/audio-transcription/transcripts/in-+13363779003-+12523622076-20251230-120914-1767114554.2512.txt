Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hi, I was trying to get one of my vehicles insured. And I was directed to contact my agent. So okay, you were trying to do what? I'm sorry. I had a vehicle to my insurance, and it didn't seem that I was able to complete that task, and I was asked to. Reach out to my agent from Alliance, and the reason for my call. Okay. Well, let me get you an agent that can help. Okay.
