Hey Heather, it's just Mark Figaro. How are you? Hey, I'm good. You get a letter. I did get a letter. I was always calling you to see what's going on. So yeah, you know we talked about this and you know Pen had agreed to write it. But now they're canceling it because of the pool unfenced. But anyway, yeah, and I was on vacation last week. I apologize. I was going to try and call you before you got that letter, but I just got back from vacation. So I am working. I've got we can either go back to auto owners. That's who originally insured it, right? Yeah, yeah. I just worried how that would like impact because you know they obviously they Pen got the check right. Right. I don't want to be significantly more so I don't know how that would work. Well, that's what I don't think. Yeah, I'm shopping it. I've got I know auto owners will write it and then also Cincinnati. We can put it there, but the only thing with Cincinnati, it's going to be we would have to move the auto too. So Cincinnati is kind of like a bundle package, you know. Auto owners you could just move the home, but I think what will happen Pen will non renew your auto come renewal. Because their package and is well, so we've got a couple options. I'm working on those proposals. I'm going to email those over to you today, so you can look at them. And like I said, we would either have to just you know you can move the home. And auto to auto owners or Cincinnati if we want to we'll keep it together and I think that's going to be our best bet. Yeah. Yeah. And what about the issue with the pool? I mean, are they going to have any issues with the auto owners? Cincinnati will not. No, I you know auto owners has insured it before they didn't have an issue with it. I have reached out to Cincinnati. She don't have an issue with it either because you're on like what 20 acres right. Yeah, the house is on 18, but we have like 70 here in total around us. But this house, this property is on 18 acres. Right and now did you tell me that you have a gate up like the getting your drive? Yes, a hunt me up. There's a gate. So that's at the end of your drive. That would be at the end of my driveway, but it's at the at the other property that I own is next to me. So because we own both properties with the gate at the entrance of both properties, right? Okay. There's a mobile home which we own down just down the same little third gravel road, right? And then there's a gate there, and then you can just access my house through that gate. It's the same. It accesses all the property back here. Okay, so you have to go through that gate to get into your home where the pool is. Yeah, you have. Yeah, you have to. Okay. Yeah, you have to because the other side is somebody else's property at that point. Once you know, so you we don't access that because we don't have the ownership of that driveway now. That side so. Okay, all right, but but nobody can access your property where the pool is unless you go through that gate. Correct. Yeah, I mean you really can't. No, yeah, I mean I didn't think anybody would know in this pool back here at all. Right, right, and I'm not talking in the middle of nowhere. Right, yeah, I've talked to Cincinnati and Heather is my underwriter with Cincinnati. She's wonderful. She just actually wrote me. I had like a god it was a it was like a. I'm a two million dollar home off Cheryl Tower Road in Lake Norman. And kind of the same thing with his scenario. He was you know way back off, kind of secluded and it didn't have a pool around him. I mean, a fence around his pool either. But like I said, it set way off in the you know. Away from everyone else, so I understand. I understand the risk of like you know the risk. You know I think for you know people that are in like you know neighborhoods and that sort of thing. I mean back here. I mean I'm telling you nobody comes down here and if you do. Yeah, yeah, it's really rare. Like I mean, you probably be scared to come down here. I mean, I would if I didn't know. Yeah, Karen, Karen, my underwriter with Pen. You know we have a good relationship and. Like I said, I swore you know I was trying to go back and find emails where she said yeah this will
