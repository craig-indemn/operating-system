Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hey, good morning. Is Rachel there? No, not on Thursday. She'll be in tomorrow. Okay. I don't know. Is there someone else I can speak to about a policy? Yeah, do you already have insurance with us? Yeah, yeah. What I mean, pretty straightforward question. I just it's not about an eight to six policy. But I had a vehicle and it's not insured. It's not on the road, but I am the owner of it. And I have a friend who lost the car, blew the engine, and went out. He needed the car. All right. I was my question to Rachel was going to be, can I just loan him my car and let him? You know, put insurance on it so he can drive it. Yeah, I can get. I can get another agent that can answer that if if that that's okay. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, one moment. I'll get one for you.
