Hello. Hey, this is Corbin again. How are you? It looks like you sent over the first page. It didn't show the change. You know the. The part where they added it, and maybe I missed it. But I don't. No, no, no, no, no. I did send you because I don't know how. Okay, hold on a second. I'll change from. Okay. I'm I'm the problem is that I am at my husband's apartment that. He is moving. That that's what delays because. He's retiring and he he has to be here until his birthday, which is. Monday, but. So. Yeah, yeah, but we need to move the whole production. You know. Yeah. So hold on a second and. She disconnected my my computer. I had a like. Office here as well, like my my corner table. Yeah. I get it. Okay, so let me. See if I can download. So last time it worked the zip file. I thought the zip file wouldn't work. Just I. Well, that one the PC. So because I was doing from iPad and that you know doesn't handle file. Zip file work too. I just wanted to see the updated one. Hold on a second. Let me download. Download this combined combined PDF. Okay. Let me see. Let me try that. Yeah, and I have I have work and. I am planning trips to Kenya, so you know. Wow. I know you are. I'm so sorry about you with this. It's okay. I need that. Okay. Documents. Downloads. Amended and this one. I hope that's it. Amended and restated. Okay. See if it's what you want. Okay. Anything yet? Are you from Kenya? No, I'm from Russia. Yeah, I thought so because you know Gretsky. Gretsky. That's more Polish. Yeah. It's a fake name. That's my. Father in law when he was in navy. He just took this name because he was a journalist. For him it sounded good. Interesting. No, I don't. She wrote a book. Well, I well first of all I can't and second of all if I could no one is going to read it so it's just. Yeah, they will. Everyone is writing a book. I don't see that many readers though. Okay, I got it. I got you. Let's see. Yeah, I got a second page on this one. Let's see. You look at the services. That's the. Customer monitoring signal receiving and notification for burglary manual fire. This is the same one because it's got manual. Best to wear for video. This might be the one. When the what's the date on this one? Well, that that's the latest that I I received from them. It doesn't say anything different than the last one. Like. Let's see. So I received it at one. Thirty-four zero PM. What's I'm missing something in here? I don't see where it says. Fire monitoring unless it's on this PC command door window. Command smoke combo. Google Nest doorbell command lamp module command motion detector. I'm sure I'm sending you the right version because one thirty-four. That's clearly the latest. Oh, but the if you look on that page too. It says. It just says basic monthly service burglary. No smoking. Can you talk to Jessica? I think she she can. Maybe they send it wrong. Oh. Maybe it's this one. If you look underneath, it's got. An optional monitored or electric services smoke heat detection included. Carbon monoxide detection included ADT. Uh. I don't know if that was on the original. Let me look at the original one we had. See. History. Policies. History. Where is it? Policies. History. This is. Updated. Contract. Amended. Okay, so page two on the one before. Okay. Yeah, so on the one before it didn't have. Smoke heat detection carbon monoxide detection. ADT interactive. Yeah, I'm gonna try this. So. It's really not that clear, but hopefully it'll let me use it. Um. All right, yeah, because it's a lot different than the first one. Okay, I'm gonna send this one on and. Okay. Let me know. Okay, I will. I will. Thank you now. Bye bye.
