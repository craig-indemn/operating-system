Hello. Hi, this is Derek. Derek, yeah. Hey Derek, it's Anna with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm fine, and so. I'm good. Thank you. I was reached out. It looks like you need some help making your payment with Liberty Mutual. Yeah, but I have to deposit. I have some cash. So I have to deposit that money. Okay. I was due last week Friday. So if I if I make a payment on Monday, will that be okay? Um, I I'm not 100 sure since it was due on the 19th. They might have a grace period. But I would say it definitely make it by Monday at the latest. Monday is the latest because I do have cash, some cash, and I gotta go and deposit in that account. So it will be able to go through. Okay, it does not show us anything but what the due date is, which is the 19th. Yes, that's right. It doesn't show us when the last date that you can pay before it cancels. So I would say go ahead and pay Monday if you can, but I would go. Okay. All right, and um, no, no, I won't pass Monday. Um, uh, can you call me on Monday? Yeah, I have to call. Okay, please call me Monday. Yeah, I'm gonna be calling at nine o'clock. I will make the deposit. Okay. And I'm gonna be calling at eleven. Okay, you say around eleven. Ten eleven, yes. Okay. So I'll do. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thank you. And please make a note. I don't know if you can make a note on that account. I call it will be there on Monday. Yep, I got a note set up right now to call you on Monday at eleven. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Uh huh. All right. All right.
