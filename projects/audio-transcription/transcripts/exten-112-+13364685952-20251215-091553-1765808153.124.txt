Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Hey Brandy, this is Chris Bryant. How you doing? Good. How are you? I'm doing good. Thank you. Hey, I think we'll be good with that if you can fix that key where it's just got liability on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No problem. Let me update that and then. Okay. Do I just pay it in full? Do I pay you or do I go to the office and pay up here, Mary? I can get your payment information and make payment as I'm issuing the policy. That's not a problem. The way you don't have to make a drive up there. Okay, and then I guess you'll you'll cancel the other whatever. Yes, yes, that will cancel that renewal, but I'll still have you sign a form for that one. Well, I'll maybe go buy the place them on. I can send it. I can send it to you by email, and you just click and sign. What a doc you saw. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Okay, and then let me get this pulled up so I can get your payment information. Did you want to pay by card or routing and checking? A card, that's fine. All right, what's that card number? Hang on a minute. Got to get get my wallet here. All right, it is five two three zero eight one zero zero four six nine eight four two three six. Expiration date. Oh, eight twenty six. And three digit number on the back. Three one eight. And billing zip code two seven zero three zero. Yes, ma'am. All right. So what I'll do is I'll go ahead and change that key to liability only, and then I'll issue the policy, make payment in full, and then I will send you all of the documents by tomorrow. I should have them. And then I'll send you by the end of the day today the cancel form to sign for the old policy. Okay, and then did you get Sarah's last name changed to Bryant? Yes, that will be on the on the new policy. Her last yeah, her last name will be Bryant. All right. Thank you for all your help. I hope you have a great day. Yeah, you do the same. Thank you. Bye bye. You're welcome. Bye.
