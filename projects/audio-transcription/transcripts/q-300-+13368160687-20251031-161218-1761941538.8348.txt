It's a great afternoon at Alliance Insurance. This is Jamie. Hi Jamie, my name's Christy Church. We are customers there. My son was in an accident that was another lady's fault, and we have filed the claim. I just wondered if there was a time limit on getting those repairs like how long the time limit on getting those repairs done is. He's a college student, so we're just having a hard time like orchestrating getting the car from in. Yeah, I don't know that. Well, okay, so in the event that he got hit and that and you and and he filed or you filed the claim against the other driver's insurance policy. That that carrier should have assigned an adjuster. The adjuster should have reached out to you and your son to collect all that information and then help y'all through the process of getting his vehicle repaired. In in honest truth with you, Christy, I don't know right because that like that that is a every carrier does something a little differently now these days. And depending on what carrier has that that that man or woman's coverage. I think National General. In that well, for that gen, they they I don't know that they have a time limit on it. I would tell you probably best to not let it linger any longer than you have to. But I. Oh absolutely not like no no we're just trying to get it orchestrated and I wanted just to to verify that there wasn't some you know unforeseen time limit that I needed to be concerned with like a month or something crazy like that like. No, I no I have seen I have seen people unfortunately they take the money and run they never fix the vehicle but in the event that you know everything is done properly right. Yeah, it can it can still take time to get the like especially like all through COVID Miss Church like the. Yeah. You know that nobody was working. It took forever to get things fixed. So I would just say keep in touch with the adjuster. Okay. And and and like in the event that they can't get the car in for three weeks or four weeks or three months or whatever, make sure the adjuster knows that information and they will and and if they change something about that process that you know they they will let you know. But outside of that, I you know I would just say you know work it out the best you can. The insurance carriers know right most part what's going on. And as long as the human is making effort to fix things, then they they will work with you. They should work with you. Yeah. I have one more question that you may or may not be able to answer. I have never heard of this before. So he filed the claim. The adjuster did not come out to actually look at the vehicle. We took it to the Honda dealership. They estimated the the total repairs being around sixteen hundred dollars, sixteen to eighteen hundred dollars. And they mailed us a check for like five hundred and ninety six dollars. And on the check under the subject line it says for full and final settlement. And so of course I did not have not done anything with that check. But the man the adjuster said that we take that check to the Honda dealership and give it to them, sign it over to them and then they will collect the additional cost for the repair. Is that something like I don't feel comfortable signing a check that says for full and final settlement? Like. And you said the adjuster gave you that. Yeah, and I have always been told never sign a check you know for any kind of claim if it's still open because you know we'll need a rental car which should be covered and. And just the point is, oh, depreciation if there is any depreciation in value from you know before the after the repair which he said you cannot. Tell that till the repair has been made. Like if. Yeah. Yeah. He didn't give us a figure on that. So what I can tell you for certain, Miss Church is that happens all the time. Even myself, I recently went through this a few months back. A tree fell on my truck during Halleen. I took the vehicle. I took my truck. Had an estimate done. They originally told me it was going to be like fifty three hundred dollars. And then by by the time it was all said and done, they practically sold me a whole brand new truck and the whole claim settled for almost eight thousand dollars. Like once they start tearing into that vehicle, they're probably going to find other stuff. That's usually what happens. So in that situation, the insurance carrier typically cut an initial check to get the time started. And then if there is any additional repairs or something, then the policy is still going to continue to pay to clean that up and clean it out unless the policy runs out of money. You know because that that does happen where people have state minimum limits and you know it's
