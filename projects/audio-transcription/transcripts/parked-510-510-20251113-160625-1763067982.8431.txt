Hi, this is Tracy. Hey Tracy, this is Kai. Hey, how are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm good. I'm good. So let me pull up the policy again. I'm so sorry. I'm not prepared. I'm so sorry. I'm not trying to hold up too much of your time. I just told them let me know when she calls. I need you to park the call because when I've got multiple screens. By the time I find my cursor, I've lost the call. I know how that is. I have Mr. Collins policy pulled that. Um. So a few things here first. Where we left off yesterday, I did find out that we are not able. So there's just physically no way to go back into the system and see what was inputted or see what the rate was showing prior to us hitting that submit button. So that didn't really help me out there. But I did find out what was going on with the rate, why it was changing like that. And I see that there were some more changes, some activity on the policy today. Did you know that he called us today? Apparently he called to find out what a short rate penalty would be. Oh, see, there's really not any notes out here. I just see where we canceled it and then we reinstated it. But they didn't have notes. So my my first mindset, oh, I wonder if if if they were. I see if he would have a balance or not. Um, but I did notice that. So when we did that today, I noticed that the lines didn't match. The billing lines didn't match. We canceled it and reinstated it. The rate changed again. So I that tells me there's definitely something. With this policy, so I'll send it over for a policy review. But in the meantime, there was about a 17 difference. And that six dollars and fifty six difference from this change to me, it looks like the total balance should be about three eleven oh nine. Not the three thirty five twelve, and that's coming from when we initially had it at that three oh one. If we charge off that additional premium, the rate should be about three eleven oh nine. Okay. Now the reason though it was doing this, it definitely was a system issue. So what I found out when we initially well, let me back up. When the vehicle was added effective the tenth, it ordered a. A vehicle history report, which is perfect. That's what it should do. And then when we changed that date and and it was backdated. That report was gone, so the rate was not right. So then when we went back in there and you uh you deleted it and and added it back with in that same endorsement. Then it picked up the vehicle history score, the vehicle history code, all of these scores that we normally run behind the scene. So there was there was a system issue there where it was not pulling the reports as it should. But when it was canceled and reinstated today, it had nothing to do with those reports. So I'm not sure why the rate changed again when it should not have. So there's definitely some stuff going on with this policy. Okay, it's weird stuff. I'm hoping he doesn't cancel, but we shall see. I'm hoping he does not either. But that three eleven oh nine is more in line with where it should be and not the three. Definitely not that what was it three fifty nine we were getting earlier yesterday. Yeah, I think it was three fifty two or three fifty seven at first, and then it was three thirty nine. So yeah, it just keeps changing. Yeah, and I I apologize, but um I am going to send this to our our product team. That takes a few days for them to kind of go through it. They do go in order that that it was received, you know, those type of things. But in the meantime, I'm going to get that additional twenty four dollars and three cent charge off. So let me do the math again: three thirty five point twelve minus. Twenty four dollars and three cents. Yeah, that's three eleven oh nine. Okay. So three eleven, so that's gonna only be ten dollars off. So it's not as tragic. No, no. Thank goodness. I just really hate that this happened. This was it was a little confusing until I realized that the system was in order in those reports. I just wish I could have seen that initial three oh one. I feel like that would have helped our project team too to kind of figure out what happened. But um after I I send it to them whatever the issue is, hopefully that will they'll be able to resolve it. So future endorsement, it does not continue to fluctuate like this because you know the system should not do that. Yeah, that's kind of
