Good afternoon. Thanks, going to Lions Insurance. This is Jeremy. How can I help you? Jeremy, my name is Steve Barker. My girlfriend and I bought this closed on a cabin in Fancy Gap, and I need to get a quote on the homeowner's insurance. Okay, and is this going to be your permanent home? No, it's going to be a second home, and we likely will rent it out on a short-term basis from time to time. All right. Do you already have insurance with the Lions here? No, I live in Louisiana. Okay. I just pulled you out. I thought about Progressive as being somebody I might want to talk to, and I got your name through the Progressive website. Got you. Got you. Okay, perfect. So let me get a little bit of information from you if I can, sir. Okay. So you said the first thing is. Stephen Parker. Yeah. Okay, sir. And then Dale Staring is the other co-owner. You said Dale Star. Staring, S T A R I N G. Got you. All right. And what what is the address where this will be built to? Uh, home. It's one thirty. Well, build two is going to be Louisiana one five zero four. Perry Court, Madisonville, Louisiana seven zero four four seven. Is the builder. Madisonville. All right. Louisiana. Got you. Um. So fifteen zero four Perry Winkle Court, Madisonville, Louisiana seven zero four four seven. All right. Okay, and then also, um, what is the property address that you are? It's one thirty. Kevin Lee View Lane, uh, Fancy Gap. I am not sure what the zip is for Fancy Gap. For Virginia there Fancy Gap Virginia okay I can look that up and you said one thirty. Kevin. One thirty, Kevin Lee Lane. Kevin Lee View Lane. Kevin Lee View. Right and the the house is still on Zillow but it shows it being sold so if you want need to go out there and look at the property online it's still on the Zillow website. Okay. What we got here. Thirty. Okay. All right, looks like we got a metal roof. Yep. You know when that was replaced. I don't know, but the roof's in good shape. We're not going to need to replace that anytime soon. I don't think. Okay, well that that's kind of a more of a sticking point for insurance carriers now is the year of the roof. So I'll see if I can do a little digging here on those. Yeah, I honestly don't know. I mean, it may be original because it's ten, but but I just don't know it could have been replaced. I don't know. Okay. All right. That's understandable there. And so on this particular property, we are going to look at basically just having insurance to protect against. Basic. Yeah, I mean I can't. It's on. It's right. It's like you could spit on the parkway, so it's up high. So like flooding is not going to be an issue. Okay, you know I I think just basic insurance homeowners is all we need. All right. All right. So. And for the rebuild replacement cost on that, I need to find that'll be. Right. All right. Um. Is there going to be a monitored alarm system of any sort on the premises, sir? Yeah, hold on one second. Does he? You recall if there is an alarm system on it. I don't recall there being one. Probably not. It's in a very safe little development. Probably not. Depends on how much more it would or less it would cost to install one, but right now there is not one. Okay. All right. And Stephen, what's your date of birth, sir? Twelve one fifty seven. Twelve one fifty seven. Okay, perfect. And Dale, you know it. Two two fifty nine. Got you. Perfect. Um, is there going to be a mortgage or not? No, we pay cash. Okay. All right, perfect. And doesn't look like there is a swimming pool or anything on the premises. No. I can see. No. Okay. And let's see what else. Possibly. Perfect. And the like I said I'll figure out what the replacement cost is based on. Yeah, and then let me know what the deductible will be as well. Sure, and that's that was my very next question. What is what works best for for Stephen and Dale in this case? Well, the higher deductible the better. I am guessing y'all got a standard of like around one percent. Then that would probably suffice. Okay, well we have a like a five thousand dollar deductible as well. Oh, you got a larger. Well, give me a quote on the one percent and the five thousand. One percent. Five
