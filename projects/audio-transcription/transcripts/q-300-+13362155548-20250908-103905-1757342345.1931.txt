Thank you for holding. This is JC. How may I help you? Hi, JC. This is Loretta Roland Kittley, and we have insurance of automobile insurance through your company, Ralph Kittley. My husband is the one that set it up. But I had an accident on Friday night. An accident somebody hit me as I was driving. They ran a stop sign. And it was Friday night in Greensboro. I got her information. I texted you guys. I called and left messages because you guys were closed naturally. And I texted. They said it had a text number, so I sent all that information. Her name, her insurance company, which is Progressive. Okay. And the event number from the police ride up, or and she got a ticket I didn't, which is helpful. And because she ran the stop sign. And anyway, I hadn't heard back, so I just wanted to check on that and make sure that it got picked up and that I can get my car fixed as soon as possible. Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry that we haven't gotten back to you. We are a little backed up at the moment. But with your situation, what you want to do is you want to file that claim under the other person's insurance. That way, it's not affecting your policy. Right, but how do I how do I do that? What they told me is that the insurance companies that her insurance would call you guys or whatever and work that out. What do I have to do? So you would call with all the information that you have. You would call Progressive Claims and let them. I don't have that number. It's. It's Progressive. South Eastern Insurance. So it's all going to be the same thing. It's all going to be Progressive. We don't have access to her policy, so that's why I'm saying you would have to call Progressive. If you just Google Progressive Claims number, it'll give you a number for you to call, and I'm looking it up right now. I didn't know I had to do it, so I'm glad I called. Yeah, so it's um I went. So let's say that um the accident if it was your fault and you wanted to get your vehicle fixed and we would certainly help you out with that. But because it was not my fault, and you have all your records stating that, you would call Progressive because they're insured with Progressive. And then they would handle the repairs. Okay. So do you guys do anything? Or what did I was I supposed to call you? You can call us to let us know that's not a problem at all, but we don't want to file anything on your insurance. Yeah, I don't want to pay anything. Yeah, if it's the other person's fault, then I would suggest call Progressive. Let them know. I didn't know that I could file somebody else's. You can. Wow. Okay. And I have that number for you if you're ready. Yes, I'd love it. Thank you. Yeah, it's eight hundred. Seven seven six. Four seven. Three seven. Four seven three seven. And then you'll give them the name, the policy number, the date that it happened, and then I'm sure once they get you in contact with the adjuster, they'll ask for the police report and more information regarding that accident. I don't have the police report. They I just have an event number. Okay, you can give them that information. I'm sure they have a way to look it up. Yeah, the police said they would. So. Yeah. Anyway. Okay. I'll call. I'll call back if I have any issues. Yeah, absolutely. We'll be here to help if you need anything else. Great. Thank you. Bye bye. You're welcome. Bye.
