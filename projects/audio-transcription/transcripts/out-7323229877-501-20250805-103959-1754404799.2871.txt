Please leave your message for Nicole Thomas. Hi there, Missus Thomas. This is Jamie Flippin here with Alliance Insurance. I hope you're well this morning. I am sorry I missed you yesterday. I know we've been playing some phone tag, and I do apologize about that. I have everything keyed up and ready to move forward with the new homeowners policy with SafeCo. I did see your email earlier that you wanted to move forward with it, so I'm going to go ahead and push the button to issue this thing effective tomorrow, August 6. I do have existing mortgage information showing up with Pinnacle Loan Services LLC, which I think is where your loan still is. And so I'm going to go ahead and put that on the new SafeCo policy. I am in office all day today. I've got some review calls right around lunchtime a little before. So if you call me back, please leave me a voicemail. But outside of that, I'm going to go ahead and set this thing to issue effective tomorrow. And I'm going to send. I'm going to have SafeCo send you all the paperwork for electronic signature. I also saw the note that you left about the dog. The beauty of SafeCo is that they will allow you to keep that dog. So you guys can certainly go get it if you would like. 336-3779003 is the direct office number. Again, this is Jamie here with Alliance Insurance. Thanks so much.
