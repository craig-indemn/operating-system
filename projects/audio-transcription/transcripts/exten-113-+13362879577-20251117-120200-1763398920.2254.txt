Thanks for holding this, Jerry. Hey, how are you? This is Colin, Chef Colin again. Yes, ma'am. I was, did I, did I sign it correctly? Because I continued to um to stroll through, and it seemed like I was, you know, paying for some insurance instead of canceling it. So I wasn't sure if I could sign the right document. The the document I sent you was for the cancellation. So if you signed it, then that that's the only thing that I sent you. Okay. Okay. Is it any way you could check and make sure that I signed it correctly? It'll take a few minutes for it to come through if you just did it and it's not showing out here yet. Okay. But I can call you back if you'd like and let you know that I received it. Okay, that'll be great whenever you get time. That's that number is two eight seven nine five seven seven. I'm five seven seven. Yeah, it normally takes a few minutes for us to get it back. So once I get it, I'll call you and let you know. Okay. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye bye.
