Hey Rick, how are you? Hello. Hi Rick, hey John. Hey, got a quick question. I'm trying to call Christopher and Ryan, but they both you know not available. But this is more like a a a a a agent's rule. I have a customer in Virginia. She has her auto policy with Not Gen. She buying a new vehicle and we're trying to add the the new vehicle to her policy. But Not Gen online and phone systems are totally down right now. And the customer was asking me if she can drive the vehicle home. And what I did was you know I I put into onto Salesforce and then email you know Not Gen and request them to add the vehicle. Already, so I'm not sure you know if I can tell you know the customer hey you can go ahead and drive home you know because. Yeah, I hear you, man. I feel pretty confident telling you that you know normal agency contracts with admitted companies like National General we would have some level of binding authority. And that that means if you have sent that request in you know the insurer has asked us as their agent and you've sent the request in and sort of documented that the system was down. I feel I feel good about letting her drive home and and that can cover that. Okay, all right then. I'll just go ahead and tell Harden. Thanks so much, Rick. Yeah. Okay. Have a good. Alright. Okay. Bye.
