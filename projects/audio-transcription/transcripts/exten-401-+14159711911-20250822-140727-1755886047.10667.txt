Hello, this is Heather. Heather, this is Sam. Hello, this is. Hi. Hi. What did you find out? Well, it's definitely July fifth, and they're going to email me a copy of my old policy. But the recording tells you you talked to you doing prompts and the recording said your policy expired on July fifth. And then the request copies, which I did. I don't know how long it'll take, but as soon as I get it, I'll send it to you. That sounds good, but it is July fifth. Okay, all right. What year was your home built? Two thousand six. Okay. I've been six years. Okay. It was it had hail damage right before I purchased it, so like a year or two. So the roof would be eight years old maybe. It's the whole. Okay, all right. Okay, that sounds good. Yeah, just when you get that, send that to me, and also email me a copy of your auto policy. Okay. Okay. And yeah, I've been with you. That's the easiest. The easiest thing to do. You were trying to call the lender, as I. You said you couldn't get through to someone. It's automated. Yeah, it's a progressive. The lender yesterday gave me this number. They said we have a specific insurance number eight hundred number. So that's what I got. Yeah, I would call Progressive directly. And ask them to send me a copy. Email your copy of your your um auto insurance, like your deck page for your auto, and then your um. The old the one that just expired for your home insurance. Okay, I'll do that right now. Do you need a number for Progressive? If you have one. I do. I'm sorry, and I thought I see you were calling. I didn't realize you called your lender. Yeah, it's it's hard to get through to someone there. Yeah, this is the number to Progressive. That's the agent one. And this is the number for Progressive Auto, so they can give you the other number for your home insurance if they can't pull it. Okay. I am trying to find here we go. It's eight hundred. Okay. Eight eight seven six, excuse me. Eight five eight one. Eight seven six five five eight one. That's right. Well, I will call them right now. Yeah, just ask them to email you a copy of your policies, and then you can send that right on over. Very the easiest thing to do. Yeah. Okay, I didn't know. I had to dig. I hope that helps to get started. Okay, I'll call. Okay, then. Thank. Thank you very much. I really appreciate your help. Thank you. Absolutely. Okay. Bye.
