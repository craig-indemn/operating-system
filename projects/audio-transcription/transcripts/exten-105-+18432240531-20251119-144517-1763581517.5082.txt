Hello Marie. Hello Rick, I thought you know what it's easy just to call you with a couple of questions because I know trust me anytime. I'm going to say again I know I don't really know about insurance all I know. No, it's fine. What does it make sense to me? So, so the couple of questions are on the architects, COI, where we have the designated person organization for the notice of cancellation. On theirs, does it need to rather than say University of South Carolina? Should theirs indicate themselves or should it say University of South Carolina? I have no idea. Yeah, the way we the way we are reading these documents that they've sent you, Marie is that the party that wants the notification you know is is University. I mean you know so so that's why we've got their names on. I can certainly you know I can certainly give you one that that puts their name on it okay the architect's name. I mean if you think that would be best. No, but I'm just yeah I'm just reading over what the what the that big long set of documents that we originally read over. I everything was to go into USC and then I know we have an architect involved here and we want them to be notified that you have coverage. But all the all the requests for the notice of cancellation and you know all of those verbiages all seem to pertain to USC to us. Okay, okay that's part of why I want to call you. I thought I don't want to mark stuff up and send it back to you. No, it's fine. Yeah. Um. One of the big questions. Oh, um and and I might send this back just to loop in whoever's copy here Melissa, Ron, Travis. But it's easier to ask you before I send. Yeah, that's fine. The two two documents that were included the first time and are not now. There's a waiver of our right to recover from others' endorsements. This is regarding the workers' comp. Well, that's a mistake. I thought I had that in there. Hold on, I'm looking over my printed this off so I could look at it too. Waiver of rights. Yeah, killing three. Yeah, so what so that was a yeah. If I well if I missed that Marie I'll have to reattach it. I see it here. I don't know that yeah what happens when I generate these certificates we have various attachments that go with the the basic document and if I fail to attach that. You talk about for the workers' compensation policy. Yes, yes. Yep, yep, yep. I don't know. I mean I've got a copy of it in my hand, but it's possible that I did not you know attach it correctly to the master certificate there. So it's probably it's just a matter of me scanning this this endorsement and attaching it and regenerating that COI. But that's that's easy enough to do. Okay, there was that one and then there was the blanket additional insured and that's the. Yeah and the reason yeah and the reason I took that out is because many times especially with public entities like this they just don't like the blanket form and in fact if they would take the blanket form our life would be a thousand times easier because we wouldn't have to specifically schedule them on here so what I didn't want to do. Was confuse somebody by saying here's a blanket form and then they immediately say we don't take a blanket form. So so so the blanket form has been replaced by these specific designated additional endorsement forms that are now attached. Okay, okay. So that's that yeah so that's that's why I took that blanket form out because the whole premise here is that the University of South Carolina just like Appalachian State and most public you know most public entities but don't they just have they just don't like the blanket form well if I include the blanket form I'm probably going to confuse everybody even worse than I already have so. Yeah. So I'm taking I'm taking the blanket form completely out. I'm also taking out this North Carolina specific form that you noticed because South Carolina to my knowledge I can't find a similar form in South Carolina. That form was only for North Carolina North Carolina contract requirements and it's specific to the state of North Carolina. So so USC just I didn't see that they'd requested they're not going to request a North Carolina form obviously and I just don't know that South Carolina has a compatible form if so they didn't mention it. Right, right. Okay. Okay. Alright. So so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna add this waiver of rights to recover that's waiver of subrogation we call it. I'm gonna add that one. I'm gonna resend you what I've sent you. I'll just add that page to it. Okay. Okay. Take me maybe five minutes. I'll
