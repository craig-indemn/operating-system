Thank you for patiently holding. This is Amani speaker. Hi Amani, this is Kendra Claybo. How are you? I'm doing good. I actually was just looking at your email here. I'm sorry I'm bothering you. I knew I emailed you, but I I thought I would just call you because um. After I sent it, I was like, "I'm just going to call and see if I can catch him." Yeah, that's fine. So um, we don't normally put anybody driving anywhere, but this was kind of an interesting request and I didn't know what to do with it. They're going to be in the parking lot driving from one like one dock to another dock in their same parking lot. I didn't know if we could do that or not. Okay, yeah, I would just about to email you back and say that I'm going to actually confer with Christopher a little bit on this because it is a little bit um you know I actually never had you know a client you know do that you know you know with the in the employment places you know. Right. In that field, you know it's a little bit different versus you know if he was we were just covering the the actual company themselves. So I'm going to confer with him a little bit on this to kind of see what his thoughts on it. You know I don't I don't necessarily you know see much of a risk there but. Is it you know is it covered is it correct is it would be my my questions you know there were well I just. That's why I wanted to ask because if they said they were driving stuff across, I know that we're not doing that. We've already had to tell people no. Right. I was like, well, and he'll know the company if you tell him because it's in Mount Airy. Like their plants are side by side, so I was like, well. Um. So anyway, they've asked us if we can help, but they want this guy to start like as soon as possible, and I got to be able to tell him whether we can help or not. Okay. So I thought I'd reach out to you if you don't mind checking on it for me. Yes, ma'am. Yes, so I'll definitely confer with him on that here because like I, this is a little bit different from you guys' standpoint. So I I kind of need to. Make sure you know that we're we're going to have the right answer on that one, but you know I don't necessarily see much risk in it. But you know you always want to be prepared for something you know were to happen if you were to damage somebody's car or you know I don't know, you know just anything. Yeah, yeah. Okay, all right. Well, I appreciate your help. You're welcome, and I'll give you an answer back here as soon as I get one. Okay. All right, thank you. Yeah, good rest of the day. Bye.
