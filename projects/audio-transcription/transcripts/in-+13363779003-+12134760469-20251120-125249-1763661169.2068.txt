Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hi, my name is Jim. Calling on behalf for Piedmont Federal Savings Bank. I say I say O A. I say sorry that. So I'm calling for Piedmont Federal Savings Bank on the recorded line. I'm calling to begin the twenty twenty five to twenty twenty six policy term for your medical client. Thank you assistance with this. Do you have the policy number? It is five four nine four nine zero seven five zero zero. Okay, I did not catch any of that. What was that again? Oh, okay. It is five four. Nine four nine zero seven five zero zero. It is for Megan Hubbard. Okay, I found the policy. So give me one moment and I will get an agent that can help. Uh huh.
