This is holding us together. Hi, Heather. This is Nina. I'm just going to follow up on the cancellation. Of my for my cost. Oh yeah. I haven't heard so much. No, yeah, and I meant to call you yesterday, and then the day got away from me, and I apologize. But listen, this it's going to be more. Your insurance is going to go up. If we remove that vehicle. Why is that? I'm going to add life insurance. I know. I'm sorry. I'm going to add life insurance. I know it's the craziest thing. But so when we take that vehicle off, you're losing the multi, multi policy or multi vehicle discount. How much is going to be? How much is going to be for the other cost. Yeah, give me one second, honey. I'm going to log in and show you. I mean tomorrow is the first, and I want to be charged twice. Right. Yeah, but it's going to make sense. It's going to make sense to leave it on there instead of separating the policies. Bear with me, okay. Okay. Who did you go with? Who is writing that policy for you for this vehicle? Does it matter? No, it doesn't. No, it does not. I mean, to give me a better deal. A better deal, but your other vehicle is going to go up. How much up? How about my car? Yeah. I'm I'm loving Independent National right now. All right. So if I remove that vehicle. And your um let's see. It would just on the the policy I'm quoting you now. It's just you as the driver and your Honda Accord, right? A twin. I'm sorry, Honda Civic 2018 Honda Civic and you. That's the only thing left on this policy, correct? If if we make that change. No, my daughter is on the policy too. But I thought that's what we were doing. We were going to remove her and that that vehicle. No, no, the Honda is mine. The Honda Accord is mine. I told you guys many times. The Civic is hers. Okay. So do you both need to be? Actually, you're going to remove me, not her. Well, you're the named insured on the policy, and you have the home insurance that we have to leave you on there. Yeah, but I I'm still um I'm insuring the the Civic. I'm sure the Honda and the the Accord and the Civic. The the the Accord is is going somewhere else, and the Civic is staying with you. Right, right, insurance. Yes.
