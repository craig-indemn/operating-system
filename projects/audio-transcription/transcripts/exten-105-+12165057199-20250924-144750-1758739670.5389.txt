Hey, this is Rick. Good afternoon. Hey, Rick, this is Brian with Novum. How you doing? What's up, Brian? How you doing, man? Good, good. Hey, sorry, Mister Call. I got a. I'm getting new HVAC installed into my house right now, so. Sorry to hear that. Yeah, no, that's probably not the steepest thing you've done this week. No, no, but uh, been saving up for it. My unit lasted 38 years. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Your money's worth as good. Yeah, and I'd rather do it up, and we're up in Cleveland, Ohio. So I, you know, wanted to do it on my own accord versus. You know, waiting until it goes out and it's negative 20 and my pipes freeze. So. Yeah, exactly. You guys, you guys have real winters up there, not nothing like us down here to have. You know, like pseudo winters. We have one day that's 25 degrees and then we then we're complaining about it being 40. You know. So. Yeah, yeah. So usually I'm in the office, but I'm I'm remote right now. But yeah, I got your voicemail. I know you were talking about a couple, you know, expectations and a couple accounts. So just wanted to return your call and see how I could help. Yeah, I appreciate it, man. And I'm not you know I'm not mandating anybody here. I'm just trying to get my my bearings. I mean, I feel like we can we can generate some opportunities for you guys in a couple different spaces. You know, hospitality being one. Yeah, I think you guys might play in the be able to play in the convenience store space, maybe a little bit in some. Some trucking type, you know, spaces and we we have opportunities in those arenas. Okay, in those spaces. So you know, based on that and and based on the I think y'all's relationship with with steadfast and ISU, we're we're an ISU agent and. Yeah. And just just want to be sure that you know I I know what to expect and then and then if I'm having some trouble you know getting through to somebody, what do I do? Do I call you? Do I jump up and down on an underwriter's desk or do I just you know just be quiet and take what I get? Yeah, no, I mean like so I'm so I oversee our sales team here. And my main focus is more so like the brokerage aspect. So that would be you know anything that falls outside of the programs. But for instance, I know unfortunately on. Uh, I'm not even going to try and pronounce it, but okay. On that account, since it came over to our brokerage team, then I had my hands involved. They're not I was made aware of it. Um, but yeah, like for the programs, we have specific program sales managers, and I'm not sure if you talked to Tony Tony's the hotel sales manager. I haven't just didn't know his name, you know. So that's fine, and that's probably the reason I'm calling is to say, hey, look if there are if there are or if there is, I should say a chain of command. Great. I'll I'll learn it as time goes on. That's perfectly fine, and and it was just a matter. Educating myself about you guys, I don't move very much about you. You don't know much about us yet, but but I like I said, I feel like we can send you some business in these certainly in these programs that I see on the website and and we've researched a little bit. Um, and it's just a matter knowing how to do it. We've got website access. I can go in there and you know key a submission in, but man, once it gets in there, I can't seem to do much with it. You know, I can't make any corrections or. Um, you know, even if I ask for a correction, that's where I am right now. We've got a another hospitality risk that's trying to get closed on this purchase on September 30th and. There's just a couple little tweaks I need to make, and you know the the close lock I can't get it unlocked, and it's I just can't seem to get past it. So sounds like I might need to talk to Tony or just keep calling Janelle. You just tell me what you think I need to do and I'll do it. Goodbye. Did I lose you? Sounds like I did. If you get in this, call me back. You get a chance. Thanks, man.
