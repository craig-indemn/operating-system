Hello. Hey Christina, this is Heather with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Good. How are you? Doing good. I got your voicemail. Are we needing to add the vehicle that we quoted or? We've already done it. Okay. You did. Okay, gotcha. I just wanted to make sure. Let me pull up your policy just a double check. Yeah, I've already got the ID and everything. Oh nice. Okay, well that sounds great then. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you for the follow up. Yes, no problem. Have a good day. You too. Bye bye.
