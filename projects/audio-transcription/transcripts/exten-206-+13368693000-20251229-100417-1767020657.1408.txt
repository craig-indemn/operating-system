Um, oh, they transfer me over to you. I've got an account of Brian's Carolina Cultivators. It sounds to me like he wants they want to renew it, but just before I renewed it, I wanted to make sure. I wanted to make I wanted to have the the go ahead confirmation, but it looks like Brian is out of the office. Yep, he's out all week and I know nothing about it, but I can try and help you. How? Well, I mean, I've got an email. I'm helping Connor who's the underwriter. I'm help he's out. It's a rotten week to try to get anything done. That's right. That's right. All right, let me pull. I can almost take it as a I mean, it's pretty much Brian must be checking his emails and maybe he'll respond here in a minute, but I wanted to call because I got him out of the office, but it did say I see this one is expired. What do we need to do to make sure this is renewed? I mean to me, I should just go ahead and renew it, but I kind of wanted to get some confirmation. Well, I'm with you and I know nothing, but I'll be glad to dig into it while I've got you here. So, what you say the name of the account was? Carolina. Carolina Cultivators. Were you saying Brian is? Brian which. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Yep. Makes sense now. All right, let's see if there's any info. There's no. And it is currently expired as of twelve twenty seven. That's what I wanted to get it out there. Yep, I see twelve twenty seven. Was it just the expire due to non pay? I was just it's the renewal. Expired. Okay. I'll go ahead and issue the renewal. Well, he's got in here as a task. To check on Connor respond about renewal. Today, if that makes any sense, so. I'm looking for notes. I'm looking for anything. Yeah, he sent it to Connor. Looks like this morning, so I guess he's checking emails. I'm sure he is. If he sent something this morning, he probably is. So. Okay. It it, there's nothing in here that I can find that gives any more than what you're. Right. So. Okay. You're probably good to go ahead on your own. Yep, I think I will. I'll give him a little bit this morning. See if he responds. If not, I think I'll just go ahead and issue it. Good deal. Sorry, I couldn't help you. I just. That's right.
