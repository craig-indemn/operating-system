Thank you for holding. This is Heather. How can I help you? Um, yes, this is Patricia Hancock. I got my insurance through you. Um, so somebody had um I got into a scam thing. And my checking funds disappeared, so then my payments were not going through, and and now I think um like. Two or three payments behind with my insurance. I know. Okay, let me hold it. All right, we are cancel pending on the auto. It looks like they're asking for four sixty three eighty. Let me check the condo. Condo should be fine. Okay. Let me just double check while I've got you on the phone. Okay, you are right. You are right. Okay, are we wanting to make payment for the auto or? Or what do you want to do there? So what can I do? I can't pay all four hundred dollars. Um, right now unless I get some money transferred over and that will be. Before it to give it time to get to my checking, it's going to have to be after Christmas. Okay, so it is cancel pending for one one. So would we be able to make any kind of payment today? Looks like the payment that we tried to take was on eleven four, and it was returned, which. Rightfully so because you had issues there, so the payment before that that was taken. Was ten two, so technically they're just wanting two months. Well, this might be three months. Yeah. Well, counting this month it would be or counting January it'd be three right. Yes. Yes, ma'am. So is there anything that you can make today though on this? Um. Not till I get some money transferred out. Um. Because I mean it was my mortgage it was everything because they took every dime I had. I understand. So the the best case scenario is that we can say hey Patricia can pay this much. Can we lift the cancel pending to to let her get back on track just because she's had issues with fraud? Um, but I would need to know how much you can pay so I can try and. And get that approved from underwriting from their billing department with auto owners. Okay, so let's say. The first payment at least one hundred and fifty. So, they're going to want more than half because you owe four hundred and sixty three and it's due on one more. What time? Four sixty three eighty divided by two. Is two thirty two. Okay. Um. So I mean I do have to get approval so none of this is set in stone. Okay. I can call and ask them. Um, do you think you would be able to get the money transferred on Friday? Um. It's coming out of my retirement fund, so it usually takes them. About five or six days to transfer it, and there's a holiday in here. Right. Okay. So do do you have I mean are they giving you funds back from the fraud or are they still working on that as well? They're still working. They're still working. Okay. Um. So I'll what I'll do I'll call auto owners. And then I will get back with you. If you don't hear back from me today, it'll be Friday because we are working Friday. Okay. Okay. All right. Any other questions you have for me? Uh, that's it. All right. Well, thank you, Patricia. Merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas to you. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
