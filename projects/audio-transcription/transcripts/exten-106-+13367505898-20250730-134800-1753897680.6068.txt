This is Jessica. I'm gonna help you. Hey Jessica. Um, this is Meg. I don't know if you've gotten my email. Um, I was just on a phone call, but give me one moment. Oh, it's fine. It's fine. Um, I was actually calling um, because we wanted to see if we could get um. Okay, they they explained it that they wanted like. Oh, you are reading the email. Yeah, sorry. Uh, so like a preview certificate. Like with the policy number, no, because we can't put a policy number until it's issued. No, it it's just because they want to see everything that it covers, like all the coverage. Let me see, and this is still for that. Because Gola company, I want to say it was called. It's Gola. Yes. Okay, sorry. Can you spell it out for me? The company is Gola. Um, it's Gola. E S K O L A. Let me pull up the certificate. Did you say that they're gonna pay for your general liability? Yeah. Oh, that's pretty neat. Okay, so what I could do is highlight in the quote um. And then the certificate, the one that they sent. I could highlight basically everything I would be able to copy and paste over. Into your quote. And then show them on on and out your quote on your certificate and then show them on the quote where that that coverage is. Um, like so, for example, there is the on the general liability instead of it being policy aggregate like most. Um insurance policies are for general liability. It's project, which means that box is checked off, and then I can go to the quote and highlight where it says here is that coverage that's included on this quote. And that's how we're gonna be able to throw that on the certificate. Here are the limits that we'll be able to use because here they are on the quote like that's what I'm selling you. Uh, does that make sense? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, because they wanted they wanted to see everything. Yeah. Okay, well let's try that first and then we can go from there. I'll go ahead and work on it right now. Okay. Okay. That is fine. You think you'll have that by today or tomorrow? Today. Today. Okay, that's fine. Thank you so much. Of course. And then the umbrella are they pushing on the umbrella too or just the GL updates. Um, umbrella. I don't think so. Not at the moment, but we're gonna have to change that also, right? Yeah, I I can't remember if you were able to buy that with the other agent. Yeah, I think with the other agent. Okay. Yeah, so that would probably have to be changed. But um, the the company that quoted us the. The GL right now. I can't remember what they said exactly. They wouldn't be able to write the umbrella, but we would basically have to go look for it in an access market. But I do believe you should be able to keep the one you have. Um, that probably would be something to go ahead and ask them. Okay. Like ask the company, the agent. Yeah, the current agent where you have an out. Like hey, if I move my general liability, are you gonna be able to um? Are you gonna be able to still uh? Like can I keep this umbrella, but it's gonna be on my new um general liability policy. Okay. Okay, I can ask nothing. Okay, let me work on this and I'll send it over to you. Okay. Thank you. Oh, thank you.
