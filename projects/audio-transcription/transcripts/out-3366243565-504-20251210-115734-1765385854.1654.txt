Your call has been forwarded to voicemail. The person you're trying to reach is not available. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up. For Margaret, this is Holly at Alliance Insurance. I was reaching out to touch base with you on your auto policy. Renewal is coming up in a couple months, and I just wanted to reach out and do a review to make sure everything was still the same. We do need to get updated emails for you and Keith. The ones we have are saying they are undeliverable. So wanted to get that updated and then check and see if there's anything new or needs to be changed on my auto policy. So if you would just give us a call by three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thanks so much. Bye bye.
