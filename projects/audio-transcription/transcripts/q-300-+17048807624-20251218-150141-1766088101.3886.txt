Thank you for holding this. Is Brandi? How can I help you? I need to make a payment and I need to take a vehicle off my policy too, please. Okay, and what's the name on the policy? Brian Wallace and Sandra Wallace. All right, give me one second. My computer has been going a little slow, so let me get your policy pulled up. Okay. All right, and is this on the personal auto policy? Yes. Okay. And which vehicle are we removing? The ProMaster 3500. All right, and has that tag already been turned in to the DMV? Yes. All right, give me one moment and I'll go ahead and make this change. That way, if there is a different price to the premium, it'll show that. And did you turn in the tag recently? Yes. Was it this week or today? I'm not sure. I'm not the one that turned it in, but I I think I've got a receipt though. Well, if you do have the receipt, I can do it as of that day. If not, then I'll just do it as of today, removing it. Okay, give me just one minute here, please. Okay, no problem. And I'm sorry about that. I'm trying to. Let me see here. Turn in date was twelve nine twenty twenty five. Okay. And that was the 2018 Ram ProMaster. That's right. Okay, so your payment due is 229. 03 cents. 229, you say. Yes. Okay. All right, and it looks like we have two cards on file. One ending in one four zero eight, or the other one is ending in zero three nine zero. Let's use the zero three nine zero. All right, that payment has been processed. Is there anything else I can help you with? Uh no, how how much was I paying a month on that ProMaster? How much is that going over the payment? Um. So you don't have but one more payment left, and it only removed 24 dollars from the policy itself. Because there was only this payment and then next month's payment left, so you weren't paying too much for that just that vehicle monthly. Is that just this month since it's at the end of the policy or was that every month? Um no, that's just this month because it well this month and next month because it's the end of the policy. So your next payment is going to be 219 dollars. Okay, can you tell me what I've been paying previously on per month on that vehicle? Um. Not exactly by month, but I can get it kind of close. Okay. Um, I'm gonna put you on a brief hold while I do all the math. Okay. Okay, well it's going to be too much trouble. Don't worry about it. I thought you might just have it there handy. No, it's not. We have to do a calculation on it. It's they don't show per vehicle monthly. They just show per vehicle for the year, but that. Whenever you remove or add on a vehicle, you're also having. So if you add on a vehicle, then your multi-car discount gets higher. Whenever you remove a vehicle, then that discount goes away. So that does take away of how much the policy decreases because that discount goes away too. Um, just a little bit. Um, since you're also towards the end of your policy period, um, it's not going to take off as much for a vehicle as it would for like a whole entire policy. Year. Um. Now what you pay typically monthly has been anywhere from 230 dollars. Looks like 230 dollars has been your normal. Um, but then you also have late fees and. Um. Other reinstatement fees and things like that that makes your policy increase as well so. That factors into to monthly as well. Right. Okay, well that's fine. You don't have to figure that. I just thought you might have it there handy. I'll just see what the the next month you say it's going to be how much. 219. Okay. Yeah, and then since your policy renews February eighth, you should be getting your um. Your renewal policy documents in the mail or by email. Um, I would say the the first or second week of January. Okay. Are you looking to look out for that? Or do you know did rate has rates going up or? We have seen everybody's go up. I mean, if if they're if they're making new vehicles, your insurance is going to increase a little bit. I didn't know if it going up in general or not. I didn't know whether it took a drop or if it was going to go up. Is what I was trying to
