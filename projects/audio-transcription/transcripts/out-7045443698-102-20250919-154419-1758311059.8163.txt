This call may be monitored or recorded to assure quality service. Travelers Spencer. Hi Spencer Gloria. Hey Gloria, how you doing? I'm good. I'm sorry to disturb you with all the females. No, no, you're you're fine. Um, you know, like I said, typically you know we have the agents bind or you know you call in, but um, it's late on Friday. I just want to make sure we get this done for you. So let me see if I can um. If I can get this done. Thank you. All right. Okay, so we're looking to have it effective today, correct? Not nineteen. Okay. All right, travelers. Okay, so this is going to be a four rated premium. Yes. So it is looking like um this will be the premium for the short term policy of $772. Okay. All right, and then again, I believe this will just be set up on direct bill. However, the other policy is set up. All right. So proceed to issue. All right, it's being funny with me too. Let me try something here. Okay. Um, for some reason it's not working for me either. There seems to definitely be a system issue and um sometimes this does happen when um. These like short rate policies. Um. So unfortunately, you might have to just wait till we get that ticket resolved. Okay. All right, I I really do apologize. I know this is kind of a pain, but um, I just I just went through it three times. Then I even tried to make a new submission to see if that worked, and that still didn't that still didn't go through. Okay. All right. So um, but do they give you any sort of a time frame? No, so I requested like how long do this the ticket the request works and they just he basically said we just seat and wait. Okay. Yeah. So what I would say is um hopefully they'll get that resolved because usually these things are pretty. Are pretty simple on their end, not mine. So hopefully they'll have that fixed by the end of the day. Um and if not, just um if not just shoot me an email Monday morning and if it's not I'll poke whoever I have to poke and get this figured out for you. Okay. All right. All right. Um. So again, I do apologize, but um, you have an amazing weekend. And again, just let me know how everything goes and um, I'll make sure that we do get this taken care of Monday if it's not taken care of by the end of the day. All right. I appreciate all your help and you have a wonderful weekend. Thank you so much. Have a great day. Bye. Okay. Bye bye.
