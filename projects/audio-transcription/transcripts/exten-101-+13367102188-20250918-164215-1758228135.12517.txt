Thank you for patiently holding. This is Amani speaking. Amani, this is Shag Glass calling back. I, sorry I didn't get your call while I go out here in the mountains, and it just wasn't where I had signal. It's all right, man. I'm still here. Yeah, I was just giving you a quick call to update you. So I have received some favorable proposals here from Greystone. It's just a few things and I'm trying to kind of cross my cross my teeth about my eyes. So we're just still reviewing just a little bit. Christopher stated to me that some of the buildings that were built in the earlier times back in like 2006, have maybe had the roof replaced. Was that was that true? They have not had a roof replaced yet. No, none of them have had a roof replaced. That's one of the reasons I mentioned to you in the email I sent to we asked about our dues. We we have money in our reserve fund and we've been putting it in to replace roofs. But right now, without having any problems and I hate to put on a roof, I don't have any leaks or anything. And we've had people come out and look at it, and generally we're told it'll go another few years. Gotcha. Okay. When's the last time you guys had somebody come out there and inspect by chance? The roofs. Yeah. It's probably been about a year ago. Right now, one of our other board members is been trying to get a basically a home inspector to come out and look at our roofs. I prefer to have somebody like a home inspector get up on there and look at them, then have a roofing company because when we get a roofing company, they want to put a roof on. Yeah, so they're going to not going to find anything to tell you, hey man, there's something right here. There's little, there's little thing right here, man. Which it's on our to do list and I was expecting to have it done very soon, but I know I talked to him about it just a few days ago, and he said that the the the fella's trying to pull it up and said he would call him. And so we got to I guess we got to get more assertive in getting him out there. I mean, one other thing that I think we, is we've never had a claim ever. Yeah, these guys have always been clean. Just because I didn't see reason to be paying a one thousand dollars deductible, but hey, if I had a if we have a problem, let me take. I'm sorry you kind of broke up there, but yeah, I did see that there. I did look at you guys' lost history and that's that's very helpful. You guys haven't had a claim, so it's you know that that does definitely work in you guys' favor. So let me confirm a little bit of information here and continue reviewing what I've got, and I should be getting back to you on where we could what we can do for this renewal. Guaranteed replacement value, and I don't know what it's called, but the clause that's written into our policy that gives us guaranteed replacement. Yes. Um. It takes the onus off of me of having to value each condo, you know, appropriately. I mean, I let the insurance company evaluate. Right, yeah, and that's what that's what we did again here when we were kind of looking around to see about some better pricing. So we we definitely went ahead and revalued them and making sure we're putting on that same type of coverage wherever we do try to take it. Yes. So yeah, let me let me get back to working here and I would say maybe maybe tomorrow. Well, I know tomorrow I have an update for you for sure, but I'll let you know we'll have a proposal ready for you to you know go ahead and look over and review with the board. Okay. And we normally pay in full. We you know with with our current policy, we get a pretty significant discount for paying in full. Yeah. And we always have ever since I've lived there, been on the board. We've always paid in full to take advantage of that discount. Right, but our renewal is coming up soon. Yes, sir. So yeah, we're we're definitely on it. So I should have another update for you here by the end of the week, and we'll hopefully be having a proposal to you here very very soon so you guys can make some decisions. That sounds good. Listen, I appreciate your help. Yeah, no problem. It's no problem. Like I said, I know I know you guys are probably a little cut off guard by that renewal pricing. So well, I was I mean. Yeah, we'll have to. It would make a pretty
