Hello. Yes, sir Cody. Hello. I just want to get information wide. Yes, sir. The call got disconnected earlier. It did. Yeah, sorry about that one. Uh, by the way, please be advised again that this call is recorded for quality training and compliance purposes. So, yep, I was able to consult in in regards with the rewritten one because usually for rewrite it's handled by different team, but I was able to check in with them in regards for this one. So, uh, for this, uh, be unlink unlinking of the canceled file. So, I was told that there's no way that we can do like unlink the old file onto this rewritten one. Um, however, what we can actually do here is we can just remove the DBA, which is the Hernandez Lions, and just click with the Julio Installer LLC. Okay. It's simply because simply just because you know what they call this one. Uh, everything is using the same information. That's why it's gonna be linked out with each other. But yep, uh, we're just going to remove the doing business as the DBA Hernandez installation. So, so it should reflect as Julio Installer LLC. Okay. But it doesn't solve the issue like like I said when I go into billing accounts and I like I view the billing account in the system. It shows every you know from the Julio Installer client summary. Then it pulls everything correctly. But as soon as I click back on client summary, so this must be a nationwide system issue or something. When I click client summary, it takes me back to all of the old. Because there's no active policies now, there's no billing account, there's no anything. It's just showing me the old. Client summary basically. I actually stated that one as well, especially in Asian Center. Sometimes it does that. So I was told that it usually takes some time to clarify or clear things up with everything. Uh, sooner or later, eventually, the old one will be purged off by the system as well. Okay. Okay. So I'll I'll remove or I'll just change the DBA already on this one the Hernandez installation. I'll just remove this one and let the um Julio Installer LLC effective today. Okay. Okay. Okay. So aside from this, by the way, is there anything else that I can possibly help you with? No, that'll be it. Okay, well then again, thank you, thank you very much for calling Nationwide. Have a nice day. Thanks you too. Bye for now. Bye. Hundred.
