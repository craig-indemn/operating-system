Thank you for calling Canv Eating the Air, Missy Sherry. Hey Sherry, it's Thina. I was just talking with you with Alliance Insurance. Yes. Um, I don't know what happened. The phone didn't ring back to me. Um. So I sent Anna a message and she hasn't replied back. Um, so she might be at lunch. I'm not really for sure. Um, but I've got it. She I see in the notes here that she um she says please call Sherry so she can make her last payment and it's got today's date on here so she's got a note. Okay. Um, actually she just messaged me back. Let me put you on hold. Let me see if I can get her. All right, ten. Nine zero.
