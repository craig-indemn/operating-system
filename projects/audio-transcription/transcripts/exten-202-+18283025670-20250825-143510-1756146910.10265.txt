Thank you for holding. This is Heather. How can I help you? Hey, how are you? I'm doing pretty good. What you got going on, Scott? Just calling back. I guess, um, what's the rate going to be now? What, what would it be if I went liability and not my wife? Will that knock it down quite a bit? As far as the auto. Yeah. Yeah, let me. I plan on driving for a while, but I mean, I got the old van. Your eyes really good face. I mean, it's my fault, right? Basically, that's what that covers. I've got I've got 160k on the van thing now, so. Yeah, because I quoted this with AO. Let me pull that up. AO, what do you mean? Auto owner, sorry. Yeah, where your home is. I got you. Sorry, let me just pull this back up on auto owners. Sometimes it's just. I probably I probably drive at least a couple more years. So I mean. Yeah. So. Probably not. So when I quoted with auto owners to try and get this with the home, we're still looking at the 27703, which was the concern because even. With the um National General, which is what you have now, they had taken off the um the physical damage. Some of these I think that you need to have it. So I got that corrected and it was Tristan. We never said that he hadn't got his license. Um. So I cleared that and then the 2018 and the 2019 have zero comp. Um, the Ultima has 500 collision deductible. The Cintura has 250, which is the way it it's currently listed. So I just matched that. But you're looking at 23252 a month, which I think is in the range of where you have been, right. It was 239. Yeah. Okay, so we dropped it like seven dollars a month. But that that's that's full comp on that. Yeah, on those two vehicles, you have comp collision, rental, and towing on those two, and then liability only on the Lexus. Yeah, I mean, they got mine's got half miles. But I mean, I plan on driving for at least a couple more years. I'm gonna drive till wheels fall off. So I mean. Yeah, I would leave it on there. I mean, because as long as we're not more than what we were, I mean, the 156 sounded nice until I dove into this and seen that the coverage had been removed. So. I would say let's leave this alone. We're gonna leave the home as is and we'll leave the auto as is. You are getting a discount on the. Oh man. For having your home with us, so all of that is there and. That that would go down like three and four, right? A little bit. Um. Yeah, I mean it's that one's already on there because National General they don't write homes in North Carolina. So as long as you have your home with the same agency that you have the auto policy, we give you a discount and that's been on there. Um, and to be 100% honest, when Tristan does get his license, it's probably going to be. Um. Premium wise is going to be better with National General versus Auto Owners. Got you. Okay. Yeah. But once he turns 18, they are going to want proof of like an ID or a permit. So we would need to. To have that by then, which I think is like December. Does he have? He's got a permit. He just got that license. Got some. Okay. All right, we can get a copy of that. I mean, whenever if you want to send that in to us. Okay, so the the month would be 23252, and then that's for all. That for me and my wife, and that for him, that just covers him as another driver or something. How that works. He's a non driver right now. We have him listed as never licensed. But one. He can still ride with me, man. Yeah. All right. Anything else that I can help with? Um. As far as the home, so that's they already paid that right the mortgage or whatever. And I'll get that three and a four dollars back. Let me take a look at the home here. Did you ever work with Patrick? We were there. Yeah, I did. Um, he was in the Clemens office and I um. I'm floating at this point. I just go where I'm needed, but um, I didn't work with him very long. But yeah. You
