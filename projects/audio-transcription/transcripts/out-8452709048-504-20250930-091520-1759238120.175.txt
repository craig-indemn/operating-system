Hello. Hey, is it Charles? Yes, please. Hey Charles, it's Holly at Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm I'm okay, okay. Um, I'm somewhat somewhat dismayed. My insurance went up, uh, greatly, and I don't understand how come it went so so high. Okay, well, okay, Charles. So we talked back in August, um, and I was looking at um, I was waiting on your call and everything to come out. So can you hold please? Can you hold please? Yes, go ahead. Okay, so I've I've got those I've looked at those and got them shopped. Um, let me get the current ones pulled up. So on the auto, it does look like the auto's increased around six hundred dollars for the year. Um, that is looking like it's just due to a North Carolina rate increase. On the home, it's up about one hundred and seventy three dollars, and your coverage a your dwelling coverage is increased in twenty six thousand. So there's and in today's market to rebuild the replacement cost of your home is three hundred and fifty four thousand seven hundred. Um, with that being said, I I did look at all of our options, bundling and separating the policies. It does look like Penn National is still going to be our best option. Yeah, because that cost safe fund and and and they give me the quote that they give me is less than what you guys are getting. So I I guess I have to make a decision whether I want to keep Penn National. You know what? Um, so if I choose to cancel, what do you need from me? Um, if you cancel, we just we just need you to sign the cancellation request. Because uh, you know if I send you what they send me, would you be able to match that? Um, it depends. Are they quoting you with lower liability limits or is it the same coverage? Maybe we should go over over what they what they they have given me. Um, it's it's you know the house is uh is three fifty. Uh, you know um, it's the same indeductible. You know what I did is just I told them what Penn National was charging me. And I guess and then I I sent them a copy. You know what what my insurance is, and they came back with a lower quote. So. Yeah, so if they've quoted apples apples, um, yeah, I've quoted with all our carriers and Penn National was the best that we have for both. So. Yeah, okay. Um, so the procedure is I would come into the office and sign a cancel. Is that what it is or? If I want you because I have to speak to my wife this morning whether we want to keep you guys or go forward with the safe fund. Yeah, if you want to cancel, you can come to the office and sign, or if you want to do e signatures, I can just send those electronically. Okay, you're here for me at the end of the day, whether I choose you guys or not. Okay. Okay, we're open till five. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Take care.
