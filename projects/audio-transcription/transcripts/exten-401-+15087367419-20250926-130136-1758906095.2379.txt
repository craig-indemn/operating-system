Hello, this is Heather. Heather, hi, it's Jim Silver. How are you? Hey Jim, I'm good. How are you? I'm doing well. Do you have a minute? I do, yes sir. I blocked you in for one o'clock. Great. So it just shouldn't take too too long either. So. Um. So I think the last thing you sent me, or the last thing I saved, was the Cincinnati package which you revised. Um and I think what I did was and you probably sent me an email about this I just can't find it but I'm looking at the one you sent me what I want to do is maybe make the property deductible down to five thousand. Okay, all right. Yeah, I got your email about that. But we were going to do five thousand for the deductible and then the earthquake too at five percent. Yes, yes, that's it. So other than that, this looks good. It looks good for the cars and for the umbrella as well. So. Okay, honey. Let me give me one second. I'm going to pull your. Pull that quote up in Cincinnati, just to make sure. That we've done those changes. All right. I think we're going to get some rain this weekend. Yes, it does look like that. Well, although it's not the worst thing. They just planted new grass in my new house. I'm like, I'm like, okay. That's right. And we need it. It's been a while. Yeah, we got a little bit yesterday, but. We are starting that drought season. I, I, yeah, no, so I mean, it's hopefully early in the morning, late in the day or whatever, but yeah. You know I was telling one of my friends I'm like I wish it would rain every night while we're sleeping just a little nice. Just a nice soak and you know. The only thing I don't like to complain about the rain because we do need it but. It just I hate it because it's like I'm going to go to a football game on Saturday and it always seems like it just. It happens whenever I don't want it to happen. It's just last weekend I was at a football game with my friends and my college friends we went back to our school and went to a game and it rained there was lightning and thunder they had to postpone the game for a while so it was yeah it was not fun. Oh, where was that at? So I went to Notre Dame, so not Indiana at. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. So it was fun. Other than that, when the rain, right, everything else is. Yeah, that. We're supposed to go to White Forest. They're game, they're football game. So we'll see. I don't know. I don't want to. I don't want to go stand out. If it's pouring down rain, I don't mind a little light drizzle, but thunder and lightning and the water rain. I don't. I don't want to do so. No, no. All right, the stadium might be a pretty bad. Yeah. I've got this pulled up. Um. Now what date are we starting these policies on? What. So we're going to start. We're going to close on the eighth. October eighth. October the eighth. Okay. See, I'm going to update that. I do need to update a date. So for all three policies, we're going to do October the eighth. Keep it the same. I don't see absolutely. Yes. Yeah. Um. And then this is the cash deal, right? Just to remind me again, I believe it is. So no wonder we don't need to add a mortgage. Okay. All right. Let me get over to the coverages. Okay, yes. So we did change it to five thousand for the all all deductible all aerial deductible. We're going to do five thousand. And then I'm going to put your name in here. Um. So they'll they'll want to do an inspection, okay? I know it's a newly built, newly constructed, but. It's just every carrier does that. So what's the best phone number if the inspector needs to reach you to schedule that time? Sure, five zero eight seven three six seven four one nine. Okay, and then the best email for you. Jay Silver Esq. At Gmail. Okay, and then do you prefer them to reach you by phone or email, which is your preference? Primary email. Email, okay. All right, and now Cincinnati. If I'm not mistaken, I'm I'm not sure of the the threshold, but I know yours is over a million. Um. I can't remember what the number is. It might be on point. Either way, they'll either do come out to All right. Okay, so we're gonna have it, um, ensuring a twenty twenty four Subaru Outback touring a twenty twenty six Volvo XC forty hybrid, C five. Yeah. Okay. And then we've got two fifty five hundred thousand for the bodily injury, um, and that is good for uninsured underinsured motorists as well. We've got coverage for rental vehicles. And we have a thousand dollar deductible, each comprehensive and collision on both vehicles. Yes. Okay, and we've got a limited roadside. We've got fifty thousand up to fifteen hundred transportation expense. Okay. All right. All right, and then for the umbrella, are we doing five million? On the umbrella. Is that what? Okay. So you get credit for having that. That's a little bit of a discount. No, Jim, are you paying full for all these policies? Annual pay paid in full. Yes. Okay. All right, and now all these set up on paper as well. I got your email in there. All right, so the total comes to two thousand fifty seven eighty eight. Once we change the vehicle. Two thousand fifty. Okay, yep, so yes, that's more expensive. Yep, okay, that sounds right. Is it? Yeah, okay. All right. And then for the umbrella, I'm gonna change the date on that one as well. Just sorry, I'm now I'm picking up some of your comments. Just like. No, okay, review it one last time before we bind everything, right? Nope, it's good to it's good to have this is a nice big box I can check off for today so. I do want to go yes and a lot of carriers are closing, not closing but they're putting binding restrictions on us. So if they cut like a moratorium anytime there's a storm out there like a tropical depression like there is now or hurricane. They will close as far as writing business. I can't write business with them so. A lot of carriers are starting to come in so that's why I'm trying to get as many policies bound before they restrict me so I'm doing that. Yes, thank you. Yeah. And I mean I'm sure it would be back open since yours is. Not until October the eighth, but you just never know if we can go ahead and take care of it. I would rather go ahead and get it out of way. Same with me. Yes. You know last year I think it's it's tomorrow the annual anniversary for Hurricane Helene. And who would have ever thought that it would have shut down the world like I mean Northern Western Carolina you know. There's actually yeah there's an interesting show on tonight on I forget which well it's a documentary retrospective about the year. On the weather station or one of the weather yes I did see that. It is it was either from state or WXI one but I've. It's definitely set. Yeah, I've got it set to record because I I saw that the other night. Oh that's going to be really good so. Yeah, I'm gonna watch it. I love watching documentaries. Oh yeah, I don't know if you guys have Netflix. We do. But I have you watched the one on Hurricane Katrina. Yes. Oh my gosh! I mean, you know I was that's an amazing. I was like in my twenties, younger twenties I guess when that would happen. Um and I was just like, I remember it happening, but I. I guess I was young and maybe. Sure you. Don't pay as much attention. No, and to watch that and think, oh my god, those people, what they have still affecting people on the edge. The city still. Yeah. It's really it's amazing. It is it's an amazing event. Oh gosh, but that was very interesting. I think it was three sections, three parts, but very interesting. Yes, I agree. That was that was a great documentary. For the umbrella, yeah, we do have five five million. We've got the homeowners and auto discount on there. All right. I've updated the date to ten eight. Okay. Do you guys have any boats or RVs or any other aircraft or any other? No, no, no, no. Wait, this is what I call recreational vehicles or anything. Okay. Nope. All right, and I'm gonna change this to ten eight. Well, yeah. Okay. Now we've got two vehicles on there and two drivers, one property. For the umbrella. For the underlying coverage, okay, and we're doing that one annual pay. Yes, paid in full. See. Okay, so that one is eight forty eight. Eight hundred and forty eight dollars for the year. Okay, well, do you have any other question? No, this is it's very helpful. I feel I feel good about it and. Okay. Happy this is
