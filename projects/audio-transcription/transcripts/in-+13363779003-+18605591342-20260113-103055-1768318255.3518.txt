Good morning, Alliance Insurance. Oh, good morning. Ah, my name is Barbara Greenbaum. I'm looking for Heather. Okay, we actually have two Heathers. We have a Heather Scott and a Heather Johnson. Do you know which one? Um. Hold on, let me see if I can figure it out. Um, actually, no, I don't. Okay, are you a client of ours? Yes. Okay. Yeah, and all I'm looking at is sort of these boilerplate emails. But I I know that I I know it's a Heather because at one point in one of my emails I said hi Heather. So there you go. Okay. Well, let me see if I can pull up your account. What, uh, what's your name? Oh, it's Barbara Greenbaum. It's G R E E N V A U M. And I'm at 2308 South Main Street in Winston Salem. All right, Barbara. I might be able to look in here and see which one it is. That would be great. Thank you. Yeah, because I just got this thing from Cincinnati Insurance. And I'm a little confused by. So, I thought I'd better give them a call. This sentence says homeowners. All right. Let me keep looking on this. It actually looks like it's Heather Scott here. Is are you talking about the email from December the 27th? Um, no, I am talking about an email I got today. From Cincinnati, basically telling me that I needed my policy documents are available. But when I viewed the documents, what I got was a bill. And I'm not sure because this is all this is on my homeowners insurance and my homeowners insurance is escrow through my mortgage company. Okay. Um. I am not sure that I need to pay this, but I'd like to know. Okay, all right. I bet Barbara. Um, let me get logged in there real fast. I bet the email that you got. Um. It's probably regarding to you. Do have a renewal coming up on March the 3rd, 2026. For the auto in the home, I bet you you received a copy of the renewal. So let me get. Yeah, because what yeah, thank you because it basically says account statement prepared on 112 to 2026. Atlantic Bay Mortgage Group, which is my Atlantic, which is my mortgage guys. And it has a loan number on it, and the new charges on it. But then it's in the under account statement. It says a amount due. So I'm assuming that this is actually just a bill that went to my mortgage insurance, my mortgage guys. It probably is, and then you probably get a copy of it as well. Maybe that's it. I bet that's it. I bet you're right about that. Um. Yeah, renewal premium installment due 313 2026. In the amount of 1411. Um. Yeah. So this might be just for my records, huh? It probably is. I haven't got logged in there yet, so I can I haven't um. Let me put you on a brief hold. Let me see, Barbara. Because I might be able to just answer your question for you. I think that's a very good bet. Thank you so much. Okay, hold on just a moment. Okay. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance Services. We appreciate your patience, and we will be with you shortly.

Okay, Barbara, you still with me? I am. Okay, sorry about that. Um, so I did get logged in here. So let me just look here. Oh, I'm looking at the home policy. It does look like the renewal issued out on January the 12th, 2026. It shows the premium is 1411 dollars. Let's see. Trying to see if it's billed to the mortgage company. Let's see. You know, honey, I think it is. Because they're the they're the people at the top of this invoice. Okay. It doesn't build the mortgage. Yeah, I'm just listed as insured. Yeah, it says "build to mortgagee." Is at the Atlantic Bay Mortgage Group LLC. You got it. Yep, that
