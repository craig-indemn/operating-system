Thank you for paging home. And this is Monty speaking. Hey Monty, I just just want to ever see the email from you about my Longjumeau Cooney in my account and how it's set up. Yes sir. Yes. Um. Go ahead. We're we're set up as a sole proprietorship, which is what I set up with Chris Cook back in 2009 when we opened up the Longjumeau. Okay, got you. All right, let me let me double check here with the carrier because basically the carrier has sent us that that notification that they weren't able to find the business is being registered. So let me let them know that you guys are a sole prop and the policy should be written that way. But I will you know I'll do some investigating and figure out. Yeah because because like I said Chris Chris like I said I I've been with Chris since 2009 when we opened up the Longjumeau he he did this years ago so. 16 century years ago. Yeah, you guys have I can see that in history. I can see you guys you know just been right here with Auto and it's kind of weird that they're just now asking that. But yeah, I'll I'll do some more investigating if I need anything else from you. I'll just keep you a call. Okay. Okay, thanks very much. All right, man. Thanks again. You a call. Bye.
