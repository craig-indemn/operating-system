So great afternoon, Alliance Insurance. This is Jamie. Hi Jamie, my name is Caleb Porter, and I was just calling in regards to my auto policy because I know I want to say Brian said that the company I was with is no longer available for insurance for my auto policy, and I didn't know if he switched me to someone else or if I am driving without insurance. Let me check that. That's a very important question to figure out there. Hang on a second. All right, my phone system pulled me into Caleb Porter five three two four Moss Creek Lane in Plymouth. Yes, sir. Yes. Okay. All right, let's see what we got working with here. Boy, uh, August. Thirteenth. Let's see. Looks like. Looks like we quoted this for you. Okay. Looks like we quoted this with auto owners and emailed it to you. Let me review that. Oh, I might not have gotten the email. I've been having a lot of troubles with my email here recently ever since I started school. Well, it's um my my worry for you now is that so Main Street America was your insurance carrier up until the thirteenth of August. And Main Street America is no longer offering coverage in North Carolina. They're pulling out. They're not. They're no longer the Paul Reubens. So all those policies are rolling off. The tricky part about it, Caleb, is that people are you know the vast majority of people they're not even aware this happening until they get told. And then sometimes they don't check the mail until it's too late. So it's it is a headache. And this is going to be a headache for you unfortunately from what I can tell. It looks to me like that policy with Main Street ended on August thirteenth. And then I am guessing you probably have not put coverage in force anywhere else, correct? I have not. Okay, all right. So technically speaking, you have a lapsing coverage as of right now, as far as I can tell anyway. And so two things. Right, a probably need to push forward this this quote and get active coverage put back in place. The tricky part about that is that we quoted it with auto owners insurance. I don't know that they're going to take you with a lapsing coverage which you technically speaking have now. So I may need to requote this altogether. I am going to call underwriting really quickly and see if they will still take this. If they decline it, I am going to have to requote it through that gym for progressive. And I don't know what that money is going to be yet. So I am going to call underwriting first and just see if they'll take it. In the event that they do, it's currently showing me one thousand five hundred ninety seven dollars paid in full. I want to verify all that money and make sure all that's still accurate. Okay. The other tricky part about the headache that's coming and I am sorry, it's Porter. I don't have a way to stop this. But anytime you have a lapsing coverage on an auto policy because it's tied to the DMV and all that information, the DMV system is eventually going to flag this and they're going to find you fifty bucks for having lapsing coverage. Okay. It might take two weeks. It might take two months. I don't know how quickly that system is smart enough to figure out. But that's that's on that's going to be on the way. Let me just confirm I do have good contact information because I am going to make a phone call. Call you back real quickly. Six six six five five zero six two six Caleb Marie one zero one two zero six zero four at gmail dot com. Shows up as your email. Is that still good contact? Yes, it is, and yeah, I just saw I just found the things she sent me in regards to the auto owners. I am so sorry I didn't get that to y'all. That's okay. It literally happens and insurance is not the front of mind for most everybody. So unfortunately, this kind of puts you in a situation where you are going to you know I don't have a way to stop that. That fine letter is coming to you. So okay, I think most importantly we just need to put coverage back in place as quickly as possible at this point because you probably don't even drive. And it's important too. Let me make a phone call really quickly and just see what underwriting is going to tell me. And I will call you back. Okay, I'll be in touch. Okay. I'll try to be quick with this. Thank you. Okay.
