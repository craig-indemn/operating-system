This is Gary. Hey Gary, this is Terry Cook. Returning your call. Hey Mrs. Cook, how are you? Sarah, I had an MRI this morning. They gave me some medicine. I come home and lay down. Well, now I can call back if you would like. No, that's okay. I'm awake. Okay, now a couple things here. When I went in to run the quote for the other company, they have a question on here regarding the swimming pool. And do you have diving board on your swimming pool? I do. If you have a diving board, then they will not give you coverage on the pool. Okay. Is that going to be a problem? Well, let's cut. You had told me that was going to be 1900 on the first one. I can't remember now what it was that we were talking about. And we were talking about the part about appliances. Yes. Okay. All right. What does that mean? Does that mean if lightning strikes your house and runs in, that you're not covered? Or lightning is lightning is a covered loss on your policy anyway. But that that equipment breakdown coverage. Is basically what it says. I mean, it doesn't have to necessarily be hit by lightning or anything to be covered. If it's a mechanical failure, then you would have coverage. If it was determined that that it was not just wore out. What happens? When wouldn't you be covered? I'm sorry. What? You still with me? Yeah, can you hear me? You're breaking out a little bit on me there. Okay, call me back on my phone. What's that number? Three three six three five one four two five six. Four two five four. Four two five six. Four two five six. Yeah, I'll call you right back.
