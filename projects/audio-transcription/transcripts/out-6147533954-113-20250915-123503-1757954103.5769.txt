Hello. Miss Pavola's, this is Gary at Alliance Insurance. Hi. How are you? Good. How are you? I am doing well. I was reviewing everything, and Progressive has you down with a Florida driver's license. Do you have your North Carolina license? I do. Yeah, I don't know. And see, I was worried about that because it's going to be hard to package it if you have an out of state license. I wonder why they decided that. Amelia, yeah, I my I haven't had a Florida license for, gosh, probably five years. Yeah, but yeah, we're both both of our license number. Yeah, one second, let me. Wrap it real quick. Yeah, both my husband and my license are North Carolina. Okay, so my driver's license number is zero zero, zero zero. Four three four. Four two eight four one. Four two eight four one. Now they had Richard correct, but they did not have one for you. So I don't understand why. But in order for us to try to package it and get you the best rate, we need to make sure that we try to do the home and auto together. Okay. And and looking at the base rate so far, it looks like the homeowner's premium is going to be pretty much the same as what you paid last year, but the auto premium is going to be a little bit less. Oh perfect. So let me let me just get on this and I will call you back as soon as I have some definitive answers. Okay. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye bye.
