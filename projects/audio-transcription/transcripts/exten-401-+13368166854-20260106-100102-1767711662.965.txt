Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Hi, Heather. This is Brandy Gray. How are you? Hey Brandy, I am doing good. How are you? I am good. I saw that you called me like a week or two ago, and so I tried to use the online portal to see like what was the purpose of the call, but I was not successful. Okay, I think it's just to do a review. Let me pull your account up. Yeah, we try to give you a call once a year if we haven't heard from you. Just to review, see how things are going. If you've had any changes within the last year, and that's what I am seeing. Yeah, so we have your homeowners. See, all right, and that is yeah, that's going to be renewing February the seventeenth. So that's like I said, we just like to give you a call and see how things are going if there is something else we can help you with. Who do you have your auto insurance with? I have my auto insurance with my dad through Nationwide. Okay, all right. So you are still on his policy. Okay, all right. Yeah, so that. Normally, like I said, if I see just one policy, and it went up, that's like one hundred dollars from last year. Yeah, it was ten eighty and now it's eleven eighty eight, so about one hundred dollars. But just trying to offset that increase, you know we would like to quote any other policy. Do you have anything else? Do you need life insurance or any other type insurance policy? I thought about the ex of my mom, about the life insurance because I I know I got life insurance through my job. I think. Do you? I did. And I yeah so I think I got it through my job, but I might want ask her if she has anything and then I could probably get back with you on the life insurance because I'll see her today so that's no problem. All right, yeah. So and then if you ever decide to go, do we insure your parents' insurance like the? The auto is through Nationwide. It's their home through Nationwide too. I don't know. I know y'all be looking for. Yeah. Well, what's his name? What's your father's name? I just want to look real quick. My dad' name his real name is James Gray, but he goes by Chris. James Gray. Or Chris. Let's see if we have it. In their house is paid off, but they still would have had it. It paid off in twenty seventeen. All right. Is it James and Carol? James and Brenda. Brenda James and Brenda. We may not have it, but if you talk to them, tell them you know if if if they want to call me, I can certainly give them some quotes on homeowners. Um. Just to see if we can save them some money. I know Nationwide. I want to say they had a pretty significant rate increase, but anyway, yeah, that's that's the only reason I was calling just to say hello and how you are going good for you. Um and yours is a town home right the homeowners policy is a town home. Yes, man. Yeah, so the HOA probably takes care of the roof and all that good stuff. But you probably haven't did any updates on the outside of the home. But have you did any? Planning on and some. Um. No, I am planning. I want to do a couple of renovations. I can tell you this. Um over, it was my thirty first day. Um and August ninth, my air went out, and so I. That was yeah in the middle of the summer. So for like two weeks, I was without air, but we ended up getting that fixed. And then let's say like December third or fourth of it's crazy to say last year, but last year of twenty twenty five. My unit froze, so we got that fixed. Yeah, but the heat was still working. So I mean, those are the only. Yeah, there are significant changes that I witness. Something I want to change is I got I need a bathroom, kitchen, and basement. This is like some water leaks and pipes. Just maybe trying to fix the ceiling, the pipes, and like things like that because I had a issue when I first moved in. Yes, yes, I remember. Yeah, oh, because you had just you had gone without insurance for a minute, hadn't you? Yeah, yeah, so I had insurance and then they like canceled. So I was like, "What's going on?" And so like when I guess during that time that it canceled, that's what. Like everything happened, so and then I have one room that we're trying to fix. Um, the ceiling doesn't have like electricity. So. Gotcha.
