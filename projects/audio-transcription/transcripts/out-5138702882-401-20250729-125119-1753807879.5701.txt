Hi, I'm just trying to get in touch with an underwriter. Underwriter for a personal lines policy. The personal lines homeowners policy. Okay, what state is it? For. Okay. Okay, I'm going to get you over to Luke Whitewick. Just one moment. Okay, thanks so much. You're welcome. Hey, Luke. This is Heather Spot with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm doing good. Good. I hope you can like help me. I need approval on a quote. Um, just trying to get it bound to get over to the lender, and they're like, "I mean, like yesterday, so. " Um, can I give you the quote number? Yes, please. It's one zero five seven three four three zero. And I'm sorry, it's a Q H. It's a homeowners policy. I don't think I gave you that part. It's okay. I figured as much. I see for Michael Ochozinsky. Yes. Okay. Did Heather already approve it for you? She did approve the. So she approved the pool right, um, and then after she did that yesterday, then I was going to bind it this morning, and then I just adjusted a little bit, and then coverage A come back in higher. So I think that's what it's talking about now. Is the coverage A needs approval? Got it. Do I need maybe if I refresh these? You say you don't see it. No, no, I I see it. I just wanted to look up the home real. Okay. She um yes she approve she looked it up and everything and approved it but then like I said coverage A of need approval I guess but um. I think she's actually on her way. We're supposed to meet them at 8 o'clock today, so she must be traveling. So usually she responds right away. Yes, she's obviously coming here to meet me, our team. Yeah. But I love Heather. She's amazing. Yes, no, she's great. As long as we're getting the package, you're good, and then the home is required to have the central station fire and burglar, which you've also. It's got that, and we are bound in them. We're bound in both the home and body. Perfect. It's got a gate like a. It's got a gate to get into the like an entry gate. Um, I guess that's but he also has central alarms here, so yeah. Yeah, even even if he's got the gate, we would still require the central station fire and burglar. Okay. I just don't is that is the gate is that and like the underwriting question I didn't see another. Like, does he do you give like a credit for having a security gate or? We do give a credit if the entire property is fenced in, not just like the back half or the driveway. It's just a drive for the gate. Okay, gotcha. Okay, all right. Cool. Any other questions to have? Should be good to go, hun. Let me refresh. Like I said, the lender has been like at me since 8 o'clock this morning. Oh, I guess coming up. So I just want to make sure I can get this bound. But I'm so sorry to bother you. Like I said, Heather. She did fine. She's traveling. I'm going to see her in just a minute. I gotta travel over to Winston. I have a different location.
