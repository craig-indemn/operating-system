Hey Rick, Annie Lacy with USLI, how are you today? Good morning, Annie. I'm fine. How about yourself? Doing great, thanks. So I'm giving you a call. I see that you were able to get a quote on a homeowners association yesterday for the Glade at West End. The Glade, yes. Yep. I'm trying to read early in the morning. So I just wanted to touch guys first. Thank you for using our online quoting system. How was that experience for you? Did you have any issues? Was it. No, no, we're we're mostly familiar with with Snap. I mean, it works well for us, particularly when we can. Pretty easily identify the class code, right? So so yeah, we we we love it. Works for us very well most every time. Awesome, good to hear. How the terms look? Everything looks good with the quote. Yeah, I think the terms are good. We we we were facing some competition from Cincinnati and another company, CNA. I think it was for a different agent, but looking at the terms that I can see. Very happy with what we've done. They they they're not sure about you know the crime coverage or some employee dishonesty coverage limits that we need to talk to them about. But but you guys are offering what appears to be you know a full package here general liability as well as DNO for pretty close to what Cincinnati and CNA were were charging just for the DNO. Okay, great. One thing to point out, and I don't know how the other carriers compare on their DNO, but one feature of our DNO is the lifetime extended reporting provision. So if. Thank you for my reminder. I get familiar with that. Yeah, I knew it was there, but had sort of forgotten about it. It's one of those little nice little benefits that need to remind myself about. But that is good on the on the DNO. Yeah. Like definitely, if I was serving on a board, I wouldn't want a policy that didn't have that. Yeah, yeah. So. Okay, great. Well, when are you presenting this? Supposed to have a conversation with the board member today. Oh, that's great. I think you know hopefully that afternoon according to our schedule. We're both kind of busy this morning, but I should have that conversation today. You know how it is, and you're dealing with board directors in this particular board member. Have to talk to the other board members and you know how. But. I definitely think that lifetime extended reporting will speak to them because it's their personal exposure if they rotate off the board. Yep, yep, and I need to. You know, I'm gonna look at. Just gonna gonna look and see if I saw anything like that. I'll look over several pages of these other proposals. I mean, this board member is a pretty good friend of mine. He had sent me the other proposals. I'll do a little research and just see you know how does CNA, for example, handle that or do they even address the extended reporting. I'll look and see they could, but but I don't know those I don't know those contracts as well as I do yours. Yeah, and if you think it would be helpful, I can send you over one of our marketing pieces that just highlights some of our package policy. Please. Yeah, okay, yeah, send that over to you as soon as we get off the phone. And when you have the conversation, if there's anything that I can answer for you or any way I can help, push this over the line. Please reach out to me. You bet I will. I appreciate the follow up. Have a great rest of your day. Absolutely, thank you. You too. Take care.
