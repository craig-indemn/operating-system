Good morning. Thank you calling Alliance Insurance. Yeah, sonny's asking around. Hope and I have a couple different questions. We have our homeowners insurance through Heritage with you guys. And I would like to get some quotes on different insurance. They are charging us ridiculous amount with the renewal and stuff. And I I just feel like we can find cheaper somewhere else. And then I also have my son just just called. And he has he got a new car back in July or August I'm sorry. And he has let's see here he just sent me the email he has National General and we when we set that up I want to say Holly got it all set up for us. That was on auto draft. Well he got he got something this morning in an email and he was like is this real but it says that your insurance is going to be canceled if you don't pay. So I need to make sure that that's on auto draft because that's what we were under the impression. Okay. And how do you spell your last name Ashley? N A R A N J O. All right. Let me just one moment.

Tyler Sheets is that correct? Uh huh. That is. And he's had to have been taken it out because like I said he's had this insurance since August and it's showing him he only owes two fifty one so I'm like. That's why he thought it was not real. Right. I'm getting to the billing on that. So bear with me. Okay. You just need your login. I might be able to pay it up on my end too. Okay, charge payment was processed. And it was pending cancellation for NSF non sufficient funds. Oh. That he has money over then okay. We take care. So how does he need to do this then? Will that mess up anything future? Uh no because this was for his out of current payment it was due on the 14th. I need to go ahead and just make a manual payment on that and it should be fine. Okay perfect and then next month I just need to remind him this is his first time buying a car so he he doesn't he only leaves a certain amount and it's checking the rest of it goes into his savings so he needs to move it over. Okay. Deal. Well I will I will I will call him on that one and then um like I said for the homeowners. Yeah that's why I'm like trying to get into next so let me get that. Okay. And that's coming up November 15th. Yeah. Okay. And it thinks too because you know we're in the city limits so we pay county and tax county and city taxes too so that eats us up but. I'm like the damn homeowners is crazy. Okay. Yeah I will send a note notice to your account Zach which is Tracy. Okay. For to go in and do that. Or either if she wants me to process it for then I'll either be back in contact with you or she will want. Okay perfect and if and you guys can always email me too if you need to.
