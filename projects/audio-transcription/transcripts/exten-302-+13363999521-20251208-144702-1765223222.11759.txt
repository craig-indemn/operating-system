Thank you for holding, Misses Anna. How can I help you? Hi Anna, this is Jason Welker. How you doing today? Hey, I'm good. How are you? Doing good. I got your email. Sorry, I missed your call earlier. Just wanted to run through that that insurance policy with you if you got a minute. Yeah, go for it. All right, so basically that that that policy is like a full coverage policy on that machine. So like stolen, you know, damage direct, whatever it would cover it. Correct. Yes, anything to that equipment specifically. Yes. Okay, and that that would cover it for the like the fifty thousand. So I mean, is that like a replacement policy if it was damaged beyond repair or stolen or something? That would replace the equipment up to fifty thousand. Correct. Um, it's on. I think let me pull it up. Actually, if it's either replacement or actual cash value. Give me one second. Take a look. So it's on the the valuation is the actual cash value up to fifty thousand. So the actual cash value of the machine at the time of loss. Correct, and so that's why we put that limit. When I asked you what it was purchased for, you said fifty. So that's the limit that we have on there. It's a fifty thousand limit. Okay. Um. All right. What can you can you run me through the cost of this again? As far as what the policy is going to cost. Yes, can be one second. Let me pull up that page. Okay, so it looks like the total premium is six hundred and eighteen dollars. Okay, we can break that down monthly. So your payment options are. Let me pull them up. So yes, you can do either annual, which is the full payment, or you can do monthly. Okay, so that's like fifty something fifty dollars a month almost about. Okay. Typically, they do require I think either one or two months down as a down payment ahead. That makes sense. Okay. Whatever is left, and they would equal it out with the with how many months is left. Well, guess let's just go ahead and get it started. Okay. Do we need to keep it with the fifty thousand or do you think it would cost more to repair it? I mean, how how much do you think it changed the policy to go up to I don't know sixty. Um, I'm not sure, but I can run it real quick. Let's run it and see what that does. If it doesn't change it a whole lot. Give me one second. Sorry, give me one second. All right. Okay, so you said you want to bump it up to sixty. Yeah, let's see what that does. Okay, just rewrite it. Give me one second. What's doing that? Let me ask you this. The fact the fact that it's being operated and kept in West Virginia, I don't know if you've got. Well, that's what you got on the policy. That's not going to change it, right? That's a garage in location. Yeah. Okay. It might. Is that the campground location as well? Yes. Okay, wonder why the system's not showing that. What is the one hundred five Metocrest core? Is that your personal address? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'm going to have to get that update. I wasn't aware that that was in a different state. What's the address of the campground? Or. Yeah, it's uh, it's eight six seven. Egeria Road and it's Matoka West Virginia. It's M A T O A K A. And it's two four seven three six. Okay, do you know what county that is? Wyoming. Just give me one second. Let's go ahead and update the system. Sorry, just bear with me. Right. So it looks like it did. Let me make sure that I I did update the state. And I did change the value to sixty thousand, and I think just because it's in a different state, it did actually go down. But it looks like I don't know if we're licensed in West Virginia to write this. So I need to confirm with. Um, upper management if we're able to issue this policy now. I know Christopher at one point looked at what he could do for business insurance here in West Virginia. I think he said he was licensed for that. I don't know if that makes a difference, but yeah, it's fine if you get to check on it. Yeah, let me let me reach out to upper management and see if we're allowed to issue this in West Virginia. Um, and then can I give you a call back? Oh yeah, if I want to um. Generate to head out here shortly, and I might not have signal, but just leave a
