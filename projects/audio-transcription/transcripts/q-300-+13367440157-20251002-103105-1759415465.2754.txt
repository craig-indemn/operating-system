Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Hey Brandy, my name is Brian Griswold. I've got a question about our homeowners policy, and I've got that policy number. If you'd like it, it's with Progressive. What did you say your name was again? It's Brian Griswold. You've got me in the system as James Griswold. All right, and what is your address? Eleven fourteen Scout Road, Lexington, North Carolina two seven two nine two. All right, and while I'm getting your policy pulled up, what's your question on the home? Well, I got a notice in the mail from Progressive. Our homeowners has paid through our escrow account through our mortgage company, and it is stating that. I guess I don't know what the date on this or the notice date was nine nineteen. It says the renewal has not been paid, but I've got an email from our mortgage company stating that it was paid. And I haven't looked on my last statement. Well, I have looked on my last statement with our mortgage company, and I'm pretty sure those funds have already been debited from my escrow account. So I'm. A little concerned because the renewal date is before, which is Saturday this coming. Yeah, so your policy has already been paid for. Okay, and what date was it paid on? Bear with me one second. Okay. Looks like they paid it nine twenty six. Okay, all right. Well, that makes me feel better because this letter's dated or notice was dated nine nineteen. So they just missed each other in the mail. One other question I've got: Are you guys affiliated with American Strategic Insurance Corporation in St. Petersburg, Florida? So that is Progressive. That is Progressive. Yeah, so that's their home side. Okay. Most of the time, for like one company, they'll have like the ones that do home and auto. Sometimes their home or the auto will have a different name, but it's all under the same company as Progressive. But they are based out of Florida though. Okay, well, this day and age, I was just a little bit suspicious because I'm like, I don't know American Strategic Insurance Corp. And I thought, no, it's not a scam is it? Because it said it hadn't been paid and like say on the 15th of September. I got an email from Citizens, our mortgage company, stating your insurance premium was paid from your escrow account, and the amount and everything. And then I'm thinking, hmm, if that was paid on the 15th, and again I just assumed everybody's doing like an ACH direct payment type of electronic payment, but maybe maybe they didn't, but. So it turns out this is legit. It just I guess was a crossing of the wires. Notice came out before the payment went in. Few days later. Yes. Okay. All right. Well, I just want to make sure my rear end wasn't out in the wind there. No, you're good. Okay, well Brandy, I appreciate your time. Yeah, you're welcome, James. Let us know if you need anything else. Okay. We'll do. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye bye.
