Hi, hello. Good morning, Brandy. Yes. Hi, Brandy. Good morning. This is Jamie. I'm an agent here with Alliance Insurance. I'm returning a voicemail regarding a mobile home policy for you and Judson. Yes, we have a mobile home. It's on our property, and we were renting it out, but we're no longer doing that, and so we wanted to change the coverage back. Okay. Um. What um. What are you going to do with it now? Like if it's it's going to are you guys going to live in it yourselves? Is it going to go to like. Family to live in or. Yeah, we're just using it for like when family come to visit and stuff. Okay. So it um you said it's on your property like like how far away from your primary structure that you guys live in. Like 100 feet from my house. Okay, so it's visible. Oh, oh, y'all. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I don't think that'll be a problem. Um. The like. That's how y'all covered it before. We have you know we've changed the coverage because we were renting it but we're not we'll do that anymore. Got you. Got you. Okay. So um like. Do you think and I'm I'm just trying to think this through from like the eyeballs of an underwriter what they're going to ask me. Um. Are you guys going to like? Regularly go over and check on the place like is it going to be is it going to be vacant until your family comes in I guess it would. No. No. We're actually kind of using it too. We have a disabled daughter so we're kind of using it like as a training ground for her. Okay. I know that sounds kind of crazy but. Training ground sounds very clinical but it that is what we're using it for for independent living. But she won't be sleeping in it but yeah. Okay. Okay. Cool. Um. Well, I tell you what. Um. I am going to have to go to Foremost. Uh, policies active. Uh, let me just make sure this is all good information here. I think it is but. You and Judson, I've got your mailing address at 439 Glass Road in Maury, Virginia, Carolina. And then the property address that we're talking about here is 427 Glass Road in Maury. That's right. Yeah. And the current coverage on this thing is. Forty-seven thousand five hundred thirty-four dollars. You got a thousand dollar deductible on the policy. So like you just you know. Looking at that, it's forty-seven grand forty-seven five. Is that still enough money to replace this thing if something happened to it? Sure. Yeah, I mean I don't know how much trailer's costs, but. I'll be honest. I don't either. Usually like because because I have insured mobile homes, you know. We inherited it. Yeah, we we just when we bought it it was already there so we bought the home. Um. Well, um. I'll leave it as is. I guess. That's fine. You know you guys can talk it over if you think that's low or something you know because you don't want to be underinsured y'all so don't want to be underinsured either but I've seen trailers for five thousand dollars I've seen it for seventy five thousand dollars so. No, it's not that nice. Yeah. Okay. Um. And then just in case they ask me any idea how old the roof is on this property. No, I don't have it. I mean the trailer is a 1990, so I don't have any indication that it's not the original roof. Okay. Okay. And is this a single lot or double wide? Single. Single. Okay. All right. So what I'm going to do first is just um. This does look it reads in my system to be a commercial. Um. A commercial policy form, which would obviously cover the rental exposure. I'm going to see if this can just be easily switched and everything stay as is in the event that Foremost tell me no. Too bad. Um. You'll have to be completely rewritten most likely, but um. I'll be honest. Like I said, you guys carried the policy before. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't I don't think it's going to be an issue at all. Okay. Uh, it's just what I was about to say is that it's the day after New Year's and we have a skeleton crew running today. Um. Sure. This will probably be next week before I have anything solid for you unless Foremost just gives me a really easy answer. Um. And in that
