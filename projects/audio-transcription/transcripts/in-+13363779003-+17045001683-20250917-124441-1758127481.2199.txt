Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. I got a quick question for you. I am on my dashboard, for my progressive, and I didn't know if you could kind of walk me through exactly what I've got, and how much. Everything is. Okay. Um. When you say your dashboard, are you talking about the progressive app? Yeah. Okay, all right, Donovan. Um. I. I don't see the same like I don't see the same app you know that you have on there. When you said you want to see what all is listed on there, are you talking about your coverages? Are you talking about how many items you have scheduled listed on your policy? Um. No, if I if I just kind of mention what I see, if you can tell me what what it is, I guess like so like on my account home here. I see I've got an auto. For my Kia Optima, and it says that the the policy date are from March to September. And this is an old car, and I'm trying to figure out why the insurance is 132 dollars a month on this old car that I barely even use. Okay, okay, Donovan. Yeah, I think an agent needs to um help you out with that. So what I can do, let me put you on hold for an agent and then they can walk you through that. Okay. Okay, that'd be great. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Hold on.
