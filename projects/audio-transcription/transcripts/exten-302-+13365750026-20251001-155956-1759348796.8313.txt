Thank you for holding. This is Anna. How can I help you? Hi Anna, this is Katie Romo with Greening Clean. How are you? Hey, I'm good. How are you? Good. I tried to call yesterday. I think everybody was a little busy, but um, so we have the you know the policy for the equipment. Yes, under Green. A Greening Clean, you can yeah. Yeah. I just had kind of an inquiry on that. Um, one of our pieces of equipment is a a Toro skid loader. Okay. And we had an incident on a job where it was like on a hill, and fortunately nobody was hurt, but it like fell on its side. Causing like the oil you know to drain out of it and I guess long story short it ruined the engine. Oh no. And so we're yeah we're having to replace the engine which is not cheap because it's like ten thousand dollars for the engine and then another five thousand dollars in labor. Um. And I I think it's like a 2014 machine but I just wanted to see if if you might be able to tell me anything about going about like filing a claim for something like that. And you said how much would it cost to repair it? I got a quote today and um Caterpillar um they they gave me an estimate for fifteen thousand so it's about five thousand in labor and ten thousand in the new machine new engine. Gotcha okay. Because I don't think you're um so this would be scheduled scheduled under your inland marine part. Yeah. And I think your deductible is only two fifty for the for the equipment. If you file a claim and but um it just and it also depends if the adjuster finds it to be an issue that they would cover that makes sense. Yeah. Um but it is definitely worth especially with it costing over fifteen grand to fix it um I think in my opinion it is worth filing it like I said your deductible is only two fifty. Okay, well that's fine that's kind of what what I wanted to hear um it is it is a lot of money and we do like need that machine for stuff so I thought it could be and we never you know we haven't had a claim in a long time for the equipment I think we had some a machine stolen like seven like five or more years ago and I'm not even sure if we even filed for that but um I don't think we've done anything recently so I don't know but like you said at least it's worth a shot and see if they would you know cover something like that. Correct. Yeah, it was especially with it costing that much. Um. Yeah. But also I mean like I'm sure you're aware you know there is the precaution of filing a claim depending on how much the insurance company does pay out it is going to affect your premium next year for the renewal and I'm not saying it it would be a huge difference but you'll see some sort of increase if that makes sense. Yeah, no, it makes sense. Especially if they pay out a big chunk if it ends up being more than fifteen grand or if it turns out to be less a religious depends on how much they end up paying out for it will reflect back on the um renewal premium next year. Okay. Um, all right. So how would we go about filing that claim? Do we do it through your office or do I have to? Yeah, I can do it. If you want to, I'm kind of I'm setting up the account now. What is the description of it? It's a Toro skid loader. Dingo, I think I think it should say like Toro Dingo or Toro skid loader. Let me make sure I find on the policy first so that way okay there it is. Toro Dingo TX. Yep, that's it. Okay. All right, and then when did this happen? I can get you an exact date, but it was approximately a week ago. A week ago. It was on a Saturday. Yeah. So let's say the 27th. Yeah. Well. September 29, 2027. Yeah, I think that's right. Okay. And then and I know you already said it and I'm sorry to hit to repeat it. Can you tell me one more time what exactly happened? Well, they were using it on a hill at a customer's property, and you know you ride it from behind and it somehow fell over on its side and it caused like all the oil and everything to come out of it and it ruined the engine. Okay. Not sure all the technical words for it, but that's long story short. But you're fine. The engine looked at and they said it would just need to be replaced. There was no fixing the engine. Gotcha. Okay. Okay. And do you want to be the main contact for this claim? Yes,
