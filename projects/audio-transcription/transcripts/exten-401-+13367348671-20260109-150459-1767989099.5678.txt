Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Hey Heather, this is William Wilson. I'm one of your clients. Hey, yeah, how are you? Good. I need some help. So. Okay. I don't know if you remember. I know you got a lot of stuff, but. I remember you. Oh, you do. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So you know, we I bought that big package. Uh huh. And so what happened on one of the properties so far? Escrow paid auto owners again. Okay. So there's been a double payment on that policy, and so they want to jack up my escrow, blah blah blah. I can't cancel. Yeah. Positive and it's sometimes. Have you received the refund check box? No, not from auto owners. I did get my refund from Allstate, but not from auto owners. You okay? Hang on one second. Let me pull your account up. Which property is this for, William? Oh, five thirty-eight Berkwood. Four thirty-eight Berkwood. Okay, I see four thirty-eight. Got it. Okay, let's see. Okay. So did you make a payment and your mortgage company make a payment to auto owners? Yes, yeah, I paid the whole package and then. Escrow from Berkwood actually paid the whole package again twenty two fifteen sixty one. I see that. I see that. And yes, the check has been issued. It was issued on December thirty first. Okay. So it should be. Yeah, I'm thinking it should already been there. You haven't seen anything from auto owners, have you? Uh, no, that's where it's going to come from. That's okay. I checked the PO box today. Okay. Let me see what we have. That well, we had that mail going. Let's see. Yes, PO box eleven twenty-two Jefferson, North Carolina two eight six forty right. Yes. All right. That's where it's. It's mailed to. And it was for the whole amount two thousand two hundred fifteen dollars and sixty one cents. Okay. Yeah, that's issued. It was issued on December thirty first. Now, like I said, we do have holiday and weekend, so it may be on the way, but. Yeah, please let me know next week. Okay. If you've not received it by Wednesday, give me a call back. Okay. Okay. And I'll call auto owners and and um. See if they can put a tracking or something on it. Okay. Okay. But so what did you want to do? I'm sorry. I said it's all making sense now. Okay. So what you want to do? You know when you get that back, William, you'll just apply that back to your mortgage. Or escrow. Okay. So it's not. Yeah, so it's not short. Yeah, that's the problem. Is. Yeah. I got a notice that they were they were raising my mortgage payment by like five hundred dollars. I was like, okay. Houston, we got a big problem here. So it makes sense. Did you apply the one that you got back from Allstate or who? I'm sorry, who did you say? I will. Yeah, it was okay. So. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's your money. Whatever, however you want to look at it, is your money. But in order to keep that payment down, you don't. It looks like now they paid two carriers, right? Auto owners and Allstate. Um, and then you paid them also. So yeah, I would definitely take both of those refunds and apply it back to your to your mortgage. That's how it's going to keep that payment down, right? Yep. And I. I want to cancel their escrow services, but I can't do it with a negative escrow balance. So. Right. I just figured that I just figured that all out just in the last. Yeah. Makes sense now. Okay. I appreciate your help. Thanks a lot. Yeah, did you have anything else, William? Um, don't think so. Okay, I'm just still trying to cancel these escrow accounts. So that's what I'm. Okay. Yeah. All right. Thanks so much. All right. Well, listen. If like I said, if you haven't seen it by next week, middle of next week, give me a call back. Okay. But it does show that it was issued on the thirty first. It's probably in there. I haven't checked it. Okay, huh. Well, you guys have a great weekend. Okay. Bye. Bye. Thank you.
