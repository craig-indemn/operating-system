Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Heather, this is Charlie Parsons. Hi Charlie, how are you? How doing good. Good. I just wanted to check in and see if you have gotten any estimates on the the vehicle. Uh, he did get one. Uh, it come in a twenty two or twenty three hundred. And another guy supposed to look at it tomorrow. Okay, so as far as your vehicle, is there damage on yours? Uh, what do you mean? I'm sorry. So the this twenty three hundred is that for your vehicle or someone else's? Yeah, for ours. Okay, and which vehicle is that? Just remind me because I'm trying to to work this out. It was the Jeep Cherokee, uh, the 2012. Okay. And the goal was to remove coverages effective the the renewal. It was yeah because it was just a week or two away and I think they took it off. The floor, you know. Right. But yeah, that was the idea at the renewal. I was trying to do some adjust. It actually was two vehicles we we were paying on one of them we don't even own and one of them hadn't been on the road in a couple of years. Right because that looks like we we were going to remove the 2000 Nissan the 04 f150 and then we were going to drop. Down to liability on the 12 2012 Jeep and the 2011 Ford Fusion, but you wanted all those changes effective the renewal date. I did. Okay. All right. And I may keep that stuff on. I got a little confused. I was kind of. A little bit confused on it. Yeah, that comprehensive. I was thinking we had collision on them. Yeah, you'll have. I mean, to have collision, you have to have comprehensive. So we it looks like this. The changes were made effective nine five, instead of the renewal which looks to be nine twenty eight. So I'm just working through this. I've been in contact with National General. And also, well, I first thought they took some money out to tent. They had sent me a text or something. I but but yeah anyway that that's the gist of it. Yeah, we would just want to do them after renewal the changes. Okay. All right. Well, as soon as I hear back from National General because I have not heard heard back from them yet, but I will reach out again today. And I'll keep you updated as I know what's going on. Okay. Okay, sounds good. All right. Thank you, Charlie. Have a good day. You too. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
