Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hi, Brandi. This is Judy. Hey. Oh, hey, Brandi. About that, what I texted you last night. Have you got a paperwork done from that? Uh, a single. They're mailing it to me, so I don't. I don't have it yet. They have it now. No, because the policy was still pending at the beginning of the week. It it just went into a like. Went into effect online to where I can see it, but they're mailing me the document, so I won't have it. Yeah. How long you think this is going to take till they mail that stuff? I mean, it depends on the the mail. You as ps. Um. I mean, but we normally get it pretty quick. You can even get the piece. Uh, you can come out there where you wrote because he's not wrote any place. Yeah, I mean you can come over here anytime you want to to sign that other paper, but then you have to come back out to sign the new one. I put out a paper. No, that's not. I made the old one. That's what I'm talking about. Not the new one. Yeah, that's yeah that's what I'm talking about. You can come by. The Winston office any time. I don't know if I will. I don't know what next week's schedule looks like. For if I'm going to be able to go to the Clemens office, but you can come to the Winston office at any point in time next week. To sign that one, and then I will call you whenever the new one comes in. Yeah, and the one that I have to sign. That's the one for the old one. For the old one, yes, you'll have to sign the new one as well. Yeah, yeah, I know that, but. Yeah, but the old. Yeah, for the old one, you can come and sign it anytime. Okay, so if I come out there on Monday maybe. So you you got that or or. Yeah, I have to go to the office. Yeah. Yeah, okay, that's what I'm asking. Because when I can sign this, then at least this one gets done. Yeah, I mean that one's pretty much done anyways because you haven't made a payment towards it at this point. You're just sending them a paper so that they will. Finalize it, and get it canceled, and then send you a check. And I also need your help with that money order because I have to go online. It says on the back of that money order. And get www whatever I don't know how to do that crap. Maybe you can do that. So I and request a refund. Then they sent me that money back from that money order that's laying here. Because I don't know how to do any of this, Brandi. I wouldn't be able to tell you either. I would just be winging it, and I don't want to mess your money up. No, it's not. No, no, it's got the number. I asked at food line. It's got the number on the back, and I call that number. But that number tells you you have to go online and fill out that that form online. I don't know why they do all this bullshit now. And then they send you your money. You have to do every you have to do everything online. You know what I'm saying. Yeah, well, I mean, kind of, but I mean, I've never done that before. Yeah, that's all it is about money orders. Yeah, I don't need it. I called it, and that's what that said: go online or www whatever and get to pull that form up money order and and request a refund. Okay. That's all that. That's all that is. But I don't know how to do stuff like that. Okay, I mean. I don't. I guess bring them and I'll try, but I I don't know. Yeah. You can do it. All it is is just a form. Pull it up, and I have. We have to put the the. Stuff on there. So our office computers are secured. So there's only certain websites that we can go on. So I don't know if I will be able to do it or not. If the website doesn't allow me to get on there. Our security system. Yeah, yeah. So that would depend. But I can try. It's got something. It's got something to do with with the insurance because it's got the name on it. No, no, no. So the the money order thing. There's only our computers are set up to do certain websites that we have access to.
