Good morning, Alliance Insurance. Hi, this is Shay with Hingham. Welcome. How are you? I'm good, Shayla. I hope you are. I'm doing great. I was calling. Um, I received in the mail a traveler's notice for $19, and it's um, it's almost like it's a cancellation notice pending cancellation. And I for some reason can't pay it online. Okay, well let me pull it up. Let me see what I can see here. Because I paid a lump sum of over a thousand dollars, thinking that I wouldn't have to pay anything going forward, so this was not on my radar. It's not funny. I've got to get logged in here. Okay, I'll put you on a brief hold for a moment. Okay, thank you. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance Services. We appreciate your patience, and we will be with you shortly.

It looks like that's on a bank draft, so that must not be the policy you're talking about. It must be the the other one. I just kept the payments list. That's okay. Let me look at the other one real fast. I must be the one. Okay, I do see the minimum amount of $19. Okay, so it does show on June the 26, 2025, a payment of $1, 858. Let me see what the $19 is for. Yeah, I can't I can't tell because it looks to me like the $1, 858. Is paid in full amount. Um, I might have to call them to see. Let me look at something else here. Did you make any changes to the policy? I haven't done anything. To be honest, it's not a big deal. I just can't pay it. They won't let me. They won't. I've tried like three or four different cards online. They just won't let me pay it. Well, I mean, I can take the payment for you. I was just trying to figure out what it is. Yeah, that part, but you know time and money, so I rather I'll just pay it so nothing gets turned off. Um, okay, so it it we can do if you want Shayla. I can take the information. I can post the payment for you. Um, but I don't mind calling um travelers just to see. What it is? Yeah, that would be helpful. And then I can call you back. Are you going to be around? Yep, I will today. Okay, all right, very good. So yeah, just I'm going to call them right now, and it hopefully it'll take me less than 10 minutes, and then I can call you right back. Okay, sounds good. Okay, all right, very good. Thank you. Thanks. Bye bye.
