Hey Lily, how are you? Hey Cody, good. How are you? I'm doing pretty good. Just busy busy. That's good. Oh, same same. I saw I had some missed calls. Was it you? Yeah, I tried to call. We reached out to a couple of our our brokerage non standard type markets and even they. No. What'd you say? I'm sorry. Oh, I'm here answering another question over making a payment. You were saying, I'm so sorry. We reached out to some of our brokerage markets to reach out to some of their non standard type workers comp carriers and even they had no options with all their different. Non standard carriers that they had. So the only, I think the only option you are going to end up having is going to be through the rate bureau. For the workers comp. Yeah, for the workers comp. You know what? I have I have that figured already since you know Ruby has been asking about that. But I think from based on numbers, what I've been seeing as far as general liability and inland marine, I think it's going to be best convenient with you because they mentioned that Chris has a. Some sort of direct deal with Westfield Insurance, so he he gets better. He gets like a more accessible rate. For us, I don't know if it's possible to just go ahead and just do the GL and the inland marine. Just to keep those two. Give me one second here. I'm going to get your stuff pulled up in my system. Yes, you take your time. So you say that you're able to get a workers comp quote from somebody. Yeah, Fielden already confirmed that with me. I I got that settled, but as far as. Is that? No, we just had to transfer everything over to my husband. In regards to the company or the name or. I'm a little confused as to what they did exactly in order to be able to get you a quote. I guess. Well, I just went ahead and you know bought it with Fielden. It is it is high, you know like you mentioned we can't do much about it. So we just went ahead and. Who did he get a policy through though? Is what I'm wondering. I do not know as soon as I get those COIs, I could probably you know give you a word about it. Okay, I'm just curious who I mean with that loss who he was able to get to do it besides the rate bureau. He didn't go through the rate bureau. I think he did. All he did was that he confirmed he was able to you know get me covered. With the workers comp again, you know it's it's still a high number. Can't do much about it due to the you know situation I'm in. But as far as the GL and the inland marine, it is it is way higher than what you you and others had proposed me. Okay, so yeah, that policy with Westfield. Let me just double check something here. When you say Fielden, are you talking about Farm Bureau? No, no, no. Fielden Hawks. Fielden Hawks. Oh, okay. Yeah. Give me just a second down there. What are their first insurance or whatever they're called now? Cody, I have no clue. Oh, you're fine. I'm so sorry. I've never been over there. I just deal with everything over the phone. I'm always you know driving up and about, and I just as long as I get you know. My situation settled. My insurance is all you know on on a roll. Then I'm good to go as long as I have jobs. As long as I have contracts and work. I completely understand. Let's see. I'm just pulling up the billing account here. It's being a little slow. Sorry. Yeah, no problem. You take your time. Just want to make sure I'm pretty sure we have everything set up on the EFT. Yeah, we do. So the package policy will automatically renew on. On the second. Yep, on August the second. Perfect. Yeah, we'll keep that. Would you like for me to email you the draft schedule? Yes, please. I greatly appreciate it. And then I don't know if you could just once you have the COIs updated for those just to send them to Ruby. Yeah, I'll send her an updated certificate for you today, and with just the package on there, the general liability and the marine. Yeah. And I'll see see you on that just so you see that go out. It actually looks like let's see the last payment we made was on six six for six hundred and ten. Yeah. So it's actually going to invoice on eight eleven and your first draft for the renewal is going to be on eight thirty one. Okay. So it's kind of it's not behind it's
