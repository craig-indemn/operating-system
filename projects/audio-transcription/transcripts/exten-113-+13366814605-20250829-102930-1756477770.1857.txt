Good morning, Mister Moore. How are you? All right, I'm on my way to a doctor, so gotta make it quick. Okay, well, we just got those documents from the underwriter, and they're putting an endorsement on the roof. In case of claim, they are not going to give replacement cost on the roof. Well, I know I just had it done about two years ago. Um, have you got any documentation to that effect or not? Look in my paperwork. Yeah, see if you can find that because if you don't, then they will not pay replacement on the roof if anything happens to it. Um, also there was a note on here that there was some debris or some some things out back that needed to be cleaned up. And they wanted to see if you could pressure wash the mold off the front steps. And that's no problem. I've been taking for the last couple months. I've been taking radiation for cancer, so. So anyway, get that done. Yeah, we can get that done. That's no problem. Yeah, when you get when you get the cleanup done, just try to take a couple pictures with your phone. And that paperwork should have already been sent to your email. If that's going to be a problem for you, we can mail it to you. Unfortunately, not. I haven't seen anything on the email yet. Maybe in the process of something. Yeah, okay, double check that, and if you don't receive it, then just let me know and we can mail it to you if we need to. Okay, all right then. Thank you. Go ahead, mail it to the second case. Thank you. All right, I try to get that stuff corrected. Thank you so much. Bye bye.
