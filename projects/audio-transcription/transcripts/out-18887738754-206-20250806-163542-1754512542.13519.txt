Hey Bruce, good afternoon Jeff Edmonds with Alliance Insurance Services in North Carolina. How are you today? Well, thanks. Let's off. I'm doing fine. I appreciate it. Calling for to see if we can maybe get a general liability quote for. I've got an individual who is leasing a warehouse type building where items. I guess consignment items would be the best way to term what is being stored in there. And he is going to have throughout the course of time I guess ongoing online auctions. For people to bid on the items that are being stored within this warehouse, it's about a 2,400 square foot warehouse. The only time folks other than himself and I guess people that are bringing items to this would be on the premises would be when they come pick up the items that they have bought during the course of these various online auctions. I'm guessing it's just a consignment warehouse. Yes, we actually don't provide any liability for risks that are warehousing goods of others, which in this case is essentially what it is. So unfortunately, not going to be a good fit for us. Okay, that's what I needed. Thanks, sir. I appreciate it absolutely. Yeah, yeah, have a good one. You too, bye bye.
