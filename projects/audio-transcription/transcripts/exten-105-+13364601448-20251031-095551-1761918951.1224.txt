Hey Sharif, Rick, good morning. How you doing, buddy? I'm doing wonderful. Listen, man, I think I owe you a bottle of booze and something here to keep the nerds. I'm sorry about that. Only if we get to share it together, that would be fine, but otherwise it's just a technology thing, man. No big deal. I may have a way around it. Now just keep in mind, I this is not my department, but I don't want to use that as an excuse. I want to help you. All right. I do. Here's my last word, not last resort, but here's what I'm proposing. I'm going to send it to my service team. Now they typically work BOPs, comp, auto things in small commercial. I don't know anything about this particular policy, but hell, what do we got to lose? Yeah. So I I just want to make sure I am understanding the issue. Sure. Key zero four eight nine whatever whatever whatever is the policy number. Yeah, that's that's the technology errors and emissions policy. It's in your specialty business. You know department is the way it's been explained to me. So that's the policy number. The ends in seven two nine seven. Okay, and the issue is you are unable to access it in EBC. Is that correct? I cannot find it anywhere regardless of which. I now have now I've now I they told me yesterday you're going to need a new ID with Hartford, so I've set up a new user ID, new password supposedly that was going to be attached to the. Producer code that that policy was issued under, which is just just it's just one of the codes that we have for the agency. We have four or five of the different things. So so so so that's been done, but when I log in using that new user ID, I still only see the other policies for this insured. This particular policy, this this this you know errors and emissions policy, it's still not on the list of. Policy numbers that I can access or see anything about. So EBC help was basically worthless. Well, they very you know very they were diligently trying to help me, but what they instructed me to do just doesn't seem to have solved it. Now I just did this yesterday, Sharif. You know at the time, you know right about this time we were we were these emails were going around. You know I just did it yesterday. I don't know if it takes 48 hours for the for the computer to you know digest all of that. And Monday morning I'll log in and it'll be there. You know I don't know yesterday that, but I did try this morning just to see and still same basic result. I can log in to Hartford one of two different ways. I can search for Beacon Technologies and I can only ever get the other four policy numbers. The this one here just doesn't seem to jeez haul. And then you know Jimmy Chan sent me a screenshot of his screen and you know he. Admittedly, he sees it on his side of things. Fantastic, Jimmy, that's great. I can't see it on my side of things. So that's that's where it's breaking down. I just cannot seem to see it. And and the other part of it, Sharif, the main thing I'm trying to solve is. Well, this is this is this is a pretty big deal, but the main thing is from the insured's perspective. He is a very this is a tech company that are very tech savvy. They like using the Hartford portal. They like being able to go in there and issue COIs and and check on their billing and do all of the things that people you know that you want them to do right. But this policy has yet to show up in the customer portal. In any meaningful way, according to the insured, when I talked to him yesterday, he can now see the policy number in his portal, which is which is a great win that that wasn't the case until just a few days ago. But but he says there's no documents attached to it. It's just it's just a policy number that shows up when he goes to his portal. So anyway, just giving you the whole backstory there and and and if honestly man if if we could just get the customer to where he could see it. And and use the portal to its full advantage, I could care less if I could if I could see the policy. But but you know if he calls next month and wants to know a billing status or whatever, I'm not going to be able to give you accurate information because it just doesn't seem to be showing up for me. Okay, all right. I'm writing. I'm capturing all the notes. I'm going to when I write not to me can insulting, but I want Go a year before we hang up. So I noticed there is because I get daily spreadsheet of everything that's quoted by all my agents. Okay. And I noticed there is a submitting agent called Marble Box. Yeah, they are our VA virtual assistant. They are sort of you know offshore people. You know what I mean that we get to do some of the initial data entry. Just as an efficiency play, but that's who that is. Okay, so they quoted a workers comp for an account called AE Construction LLC. We came in at like almost forty grand. And just judging by the name, I didn't follow up with it, but it definitely got me curious because it's forty grand. I did call up and I'm like, can I speak with Marble? What the heck, idiot. What's the name? No, like that's yeah. That's our VA assisted. So what's the name of it again? A the letter A letter E. A letter E letter A letter E Construction. Oh, hang on. Trying to see if I can find it in my system just to give you whatever information I can. Sure, but it's a face E. Okay, let's try that. Yeah, here we go. Let's see. Here's an opportunity. Let's see where we're at here, which is the most recent. No, and that one's an old one. Let's see, let me see what's current. Hold on. This was work comp. He said. Work comp. I am baffled. Is it do you show an address of Kirby Road in King North Carolina? That's the same account or do you show that? I can yeah let me double check for you real quick. I see an old. I mean I see I see an opportunity, almost two years old here, but. I don't see anything other than a cyber quote. That is, and even that even that's a year old. I'm confused, man. I don't unless I I mean in our system we we went through these system changes several months ago and there's a lot of duplicates in our system. Yeah. It could be a DBA. Let me see if there's a. Yeah, chances are it's a DBA. Let me double check. I'm going to see if I can find it. I kind of see it myself as well. I think I can probably find it. I can. Tc construction AEC. Yes, AE Construction. It is a bindable quote. It is on Kirby Road, King North Carolina. All right, well that's the same that's the right account that I'm seeing in my system, but I am not. I am not and now of course Icon is being slow at, but go to the next screen. Let me go back to BT Corp. Hang on a second. Let's see. Oh, here we go. Let's see. Here is a Marble Box. Please pull work comp quote. Man, I'm seeing some chatter here. Sharif, this is being worked by Anna Joyce. That's that's really who the account manager would be here. She's she's gonna probably yeah she's gonna probably have a lot more current information than me. Drop her an email. You know, you got a email. A Joyce at. You got her email. I don't. Her name is Anna. A N N A A N A one A and. Oh A N A yeah yeah yeah Anna Joyce. Yeah, so it's so her email was A Joyce. And that's A Y T. Yeah, and then at my alliance insurance. Dot com is same as my email, but yeah, drop her drop her a note. I just see that she has a task here. This is as that do we do we do we have quotes and I think she's asked Marble Box to probably quote that with some material. You guys are on the list there. So so yeah, drop her that note. I just don't see a whole lot of. Detail in this in this opportunity that I'm looking at and it may just be I'm not looking at the right spot which is user error on my part. Yeah, no, no, no words at all. So my alliance insurance. Dot com. Yeah, okay. I will. Yeah, see what feedback she's got there. I don't. I just I don't even see an effective date here. Looks like it might be a December account. You know maybe maybe she's just trying to get ahead of it. Activator, you show on on that quote. Twelve fifteen. Yeah, that's that's exactly the right account. I just don't have much. To offer you there on a will and if she doesn't, she can refer you back to the producer on it. Is Chris Fix and you know give you some kind of feedback. That's then yeah, it seems like a decent account. I just don't
