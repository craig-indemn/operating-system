And then I'm not seeing a double bill with the workers' comp, so I'm gonna assume that's just a November September's bill. Let's do right now for two thousand nine hundred eighty-three. Okay. Um. Well, can you help me so I can make a payment? Uh, for the update to the the GL. Okay, is this with your Wood Forest National Bank? Yes. And then um, on next week I'll be uh, I'll just call to make the other payment for the workers' comp. Okay, that's fine. Um, I'm gonna send you the um via email the billing numbers and the websites um where you can go and also make these payments. Honestly, it would be more convenient than like you having to call us every time. Also, you just be able to do it on your on your phone or on your computer. Okay. As well, and also in case I don't pick up or glory is not available, you're not waiting on us just to make a payment. Okay. That sounds good. Okay, I'll send that over. Um. I can't remember where we left off with the. With the auto insurance, did we start that already or did you? I think I sent you an updated quote. The auto insurance. Yeah, we already got it. Oh, okay. Sorry, it's been a busy week. I just couldn't remember if we were still working on something. Okay, good. Um, I think that was it. Okay, well let me know if you guys seen anything there. Um. I don't think you told me if there was any banks like that you guys were making payments for on those cars. Um, if so, that bank would probably want to know that you have new insurance and they'll send you a letter or something saying, "Hey, we need proof of insurance so we don't force place insurance on your monthly payment." Um, I'll need their name and address on how they want to be listed as a lien holder. For the auto insurance. Yeah, for your your cars if you make payments on them, like to a bank or something. Okay. Um. Do you want me to send them to you, or can I just give them to you? Yeah, send them to me, please. Okay, I just have two vehicles that were financing. My mom's van is not. Being financed no more. Okay. Okay, so I'll just send this to you. What do you need? Just the account, the financing. Bank name. Yeah, it should be a bank name and their address. Okay, that's okay. Okay. I'll send it to you. Um. How about oh? Did you say that you needed the last run right for the? For the umbrella, yes. The last run, yeah. Okay. Uh, and that was it. Um. Yeah, and I'm still waiting to get a quote back on that. Um. Yeah. So yeah. Okay, and um. Did you okay? Yeah. Thank you. Okay, that was good. Thank you.
