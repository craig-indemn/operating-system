Hello. Hey Sonya, this is Jeremy. All right. Hey Jeremy, how are you doing? I'm good. I hope you are. I'm doing fine. My voice just doesn't always work well in the mornings. I understand. That is no trouble at all. No trouble at all. I'm going to let you know. I took and I had done a proposal up with auto owners. Uh huh. And the home, now I forecasted January 19th as a start on all this because that looks like roughly before your renewal starts with Grange. Uh huh. The homeowners paid in full discount would be 1, 051. Okay. The automobile for a year would be 1580. Point 24. Okay. So I think roughly it's maybe 900 savings overall annually. For you. Yeah. Is what it looks like, and you would. Let's see, we increased one of your liability coverages on your auto because. The property damage was set low instead of at 100, 000. We set it at 100 instead of at 50, which actually didn't really impact the premium greatly, but you're still saving a chunk on auto anyway. The trailer, the horse trailer. We did a deductible of 500 collision instead of 250. I think is what you had on that. So that kind of helped to move the needle a little bit too. And. I think that was the biggest thing that we were looking at that we had done is that we we just moved those a little bit to where it would lessen the pain without you suffering if that makes sense. Right. Right. So with that being said, just want to know what your thoughts were. What questions you may have for me because I'm doing all the talking. I'm sorry. Okay. Um, and that gives me on the house that gives me all the coverage that I need. Yes, ma'am. Yeah, on the house. It has the the dwelling. We're covering actually for 292, 291, 700. Okay. That sounds a little bit better. I think it had 250 on it, just 250 on it, and it was like I don't know that you could rebuild for that. Well, and we protected you a little bit further with an extra 25 above that. So let's say you had a total loss. Right. God forbid that were ever happened, but we were rebuilding and you know we got to 291, 700 and we weren't quite done. What would happen is an extra 25 percent of that could be available for rebuilding only. And that would be another 72, 925 dollars. So that's got a buffer in there. You've actually got a little bit more coverage for total loss than you do. Than what it shows, and that's a cheaper way for us to endorse it than it is to put that extra 73, 000 into the dwelling coverage at the beginning. It impacts the premium a whole lot higher. Okay. This also has. Mortgage free discount included, personal property replacement cost all things that you pretty much had there. Um and I believe we've got the equipment breakdown coverage up to 100, 000 and the service line coverage. As well, which is anything. Do you know what service line coverage is? No. So it's from your from the street to your home. If you had city water, which I don't know if you do or not. Um, it would cover any repair work had to be done from there to your home. Same thing with with the power company. Power company will do anything, but whatever comes off that pole from the street to your house, they're going to bill you for. Well, this would cover the service line coverage covers up to 10, 000 dollars and it's only a 500 deductible. On that, all right. Um, so it's got it's a little bit more robust than what you had. It's a little cheaper than what you had. The deductible for wind and hail, which is the roof basically getting ripped off, is 2, 000 dollars with them. And any other deductible, any other perils that are covered, any other deductibles you would have are at a thousand dollars. Besides that, those can be increased if you're comfortable with them being higher. You just got to tell me. I just went kind of with the baseline and just would let because only thing it'll do if you raise it, your premiums it's going to go down. So it's dependent upon what you want to do there. And what what company is this through? Auto owners. They're out of Michigan. They're an AM
