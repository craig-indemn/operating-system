Hello, this Jeff, can I help you? Hey Jeff, this is Timothy. Hey Timothy, call back. Yep, I think I figured it out. So last year I went the first time and on the on the bond it said just Timothy, I think it just said D two's auto sales or something and. I've been going through the emails I had with the DMV guy and we got it fixed that says Timothy Dawson Durham DBA D two's auto sales and the wet signature is he was talking about so I had to drive up there and I signed right there. On that the bottom of that bond and I signed the incorrect one last year and I had to get the new one and go drive away back up there and put a wet signature on it so. I think I figured I think I figured it out. Okay, so do you have what you need based on what I sent you? Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm trying to figure it out and I feel like you should too just in looking at it but I I wanted to make sure you were comfortable with what we sent you. What I had emailed you back in well hang on I jumped into another case here let me go back to what I sent you in June. I believe I sent you a copy of the original bond just so you would have it not that you would need it but that was really more just for you to have. Then Travelers generates a verification certificate at renewal. Yeah. And that basically says that the bond number and it gives current dates June 18 of 2025 to June 18 2026. And basically it says the current bond remains in effect subject to all agreements, conditions, and limitations and it has a stamp and an attorney in fact signature from Travelers Bond Representative. That should suffice. That should be satisfactory when accompanied with the original bond. Okay. And then I also included in that email back in June. I can resend all this if you need it. Your COI your yeah I'll see it right here the certificate of liability the bond renewal and then you sent me the original bond. Exactly. Yeah. I thought I think that's going to work. The only thing is they might. If if worst case scenario I drive up there, do you think Travelers could send me a new bond that looks like the original bond I had? You know like that. Well, what I have what I'm looking at on their site are. Let's see the original that was issued on June 18th. That's the one that had Timothy Durham just had your name. Yeah. And then on July 3rd. That was that one that just said D two's auto sales. Yeah. And then on July 15th they issued what I sent you in the email back in June that says both it says Timothy Dawson Durham DBA D two's auto sales. Yeah. And that's straight from Travelers site. Yeah, and the only thing I'm worried about is possibly the original bond they sent me at the very last page it has got murder. It's from June 18 2024. It's last year's. It has the correct Timothy Dawson Durham DBA D two's auto sales. That is a DMV actual paper. It's the LT 49 form. I'm I just I'm kind of worried they might need that 49 form filled out like that again with the new bond on it. Or would it be the same bond because it's a you know what I'm saying it should the recertification should. I don't think that's the right word. It's not. It's the verification. I apologize. The verification certificate accompanied with that original bond should be satisfactory. Okay. Because they just don't they just don't reissue the bond. They what they do each year is they they'll generate a verification certificate with current billing terms of June 18 2025 to June 18 2026. Yeah. And they do that each year. If you get there and you they just tell you hey we've got to have something different. Then call us from there and let's see what they've got to have because. Okay. There's just nothing that they generate other than that verification certificate. Yeah, the only thing I thought they might the dealer's office would might need is the actual motor vehicle dealer's security bond paperwork like they had filled out. Right here on the original the LT 49 form that's the only thing that they might need but I'm hoping hopefully not if they do I'll give you a call. Yeah, let's go because we'll be here. I'll be here tomorrow. I should be here all day tomorrow. What when do you plan on being there? Are you going tomorrow? Yeah, I'm going to try to go tomorrow morning earliest possible because they say they say get an hour before they open so they
