Your call has been forwarded to voicemail. The person you're trying to reach is not available. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up. Marissa, this is Rachel Hall of Lions Insurance in Salt Mountain, calling on your mom's house insurance, and see where you've made a payment on it. But since your mom has been deceased over a year, your POA, power of attorney is no good in the house. The company, if there's a claim, they would not pay anything on it because everything's supposed to be taken care of. You need to get that in your name. So please call me back because I've got to notify the company that she's been she's deceased and they will come off the house insurance. So call me back at three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three and my extension is seven zero two or you can talk to another agent in the office. Thank you.
