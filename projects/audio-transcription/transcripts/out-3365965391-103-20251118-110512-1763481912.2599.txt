Hey, what's up, man? Hi, this is Wendell with Alliance Insurance. Oh, hey, how are you? I'm good. How are you? This is James. Speak. Yeah, I'll be doing okay. I am. Yes, I got your information. I heard that you were calling in about your audit for the workers' compensation. Yeah, so I mean, I got a couple questions for you. So because like I called I called AmTrust and I was like, "Hey, like what is what what is this?" So so we have a from my understanding it's a ghost policy. Right, it's a ghost policy. Is that still what that's showing as? Yes, I believe so. Here I guess here was here was kind of my question. So I called them and I was like, "Hey, what is this audit about?" Because they sent me a letter. They're like, "Hey, we actually want to we want I guess like I ran from one policy year and they said, Hey, we've done an audit and we want to take another 2, 400 bucks from you." And I was like, "Well, what what is that based off of?" Right? I was like, "Because you have no employees and it's a ghost policy, like it doesn't actually cover anything." I was like, "We want a whole year. We've got no claims. " I said, "We can't even really like I can't even really file a claim. It's like insurance that doesn't have a claim basis." Right? And they said, "Well, it's going to be another 2, 400 bucks." So I guess I'm trying to understand like if it's if it's a ghost policy how how does it run a full year and then they come back and they say, "Hey, actually we're going to charge you 130 more than what your original premium was." That doesn't that doesn't seem. I'm missing terms. So they ask for PNL and again like we do a lot of to sum up in a nutshell there's a lot of arbitrage of like hey we'll we'll get a job you know it'll have flooring right like say carpet LVP you know client A is going to pay more than client B charges to get it done so we're basically the middleman in between that but they're asking for a PNL and I guess what my my concern is is they're trying to penalize me for someone that has nothing like that workers' comp doesn't cover that you know what I mean I can't like if I if I have an independent party come in and they put flooring in a house and let's just say pretend I charge the client 5, 000 they put it in for 3, 500 my profit is 15 that has nothing to do with workers' comp so it's like it kind of feels like a bait and switch thing where it's like they're looking for a PNL and they're like well hey you made money sell a couch on eBay so we're going to charge you a higher premium that has nothing to do with it like it's almost like your auto policy asking you see how much money you make at your job because it's a ghost policy like I can I can understand if I had six employees at the beginning of the year and then I had 12 employees later they're like hey you've grown you've got more employees like we need to charge you more that makes sense but I'm I'm having a hard time understanding like what what is that process because like we're still with them they said well you you're not with us anymore I'm like yeah I'm still paying a premium with AmTrust for like it's through TTI or Tectronic Technology Incorporated whatever it is but can am I am I wrong here because again like it doesn't cover anything it's it's not like an auto policy where it's like hey I told you I'm going to drive 15, 000 miles but I drive 100 and then progress is like whoa buddy you're driving way more than you told us they're they're asking for like a PNL statement but I'm not I'm not sure of the relevance and how that's connected you see what I mean like if let's just say let's just say like from a from my physical labor which again is where the workers' comp comes from let's say for my physical labor is going to be 80 grand a year but I make 120 through arbitrage of different subbing out I'm going to double my income and they're trying to charge me for money that has nothing to do with that does that I guess does that make sense that's kind of where my head's going I'm just trying to understand like what am I supposed to do because I told the lady I was like Not all. I should let you set it up on Autopay. Oh, is it not? Is it not let me do it by month on this one? It is going to show an amount I think of three hundred six because it for two months. Oh oh I got you current due. There we go. I was about to say God don't because it's got that other fee on man. So does it have? No see yeah amount due. Yeah no it's it's not. Yeah even when that's. Yeah even when I sorry what was that policy number again. TWC four four eight seven four five one. It's showing two due right now it's one fifty three and then um. Since it went past due it's adding in the next month so it's showing three hundred six. Yeah the problem is when I hit three hundred six like so it lets you select. Like hey what do you want to pay? Oh let me see so three hundred six current due. Yeah it won't no it won't let me it won't let me pay it because oh hold on let me see. Maybe we'll now. Oh there we go okay yeah no it was trying to put um it was trying to put the other one on there at the same time. Okay. Yeah that should be good so I guess on here it says like an audit dispute I mean have we have you ever had to deal with one of these before like do you know what I need to put in that. Because I guess what I'm worried about is again it's going to take forever for these guys to respond I don't want it to. Typically um the experiences I've had email on the audit departments it may take a couple days. But they should be pretty quick. Which a couple days is usually quick for an audit department. Oh I know um okay. So I guess in the email what do I kind of need to. Just put in there. I'll just put that you were charged that fee for non cooperative audit but you do want to have it reopened. And complete the audit. And then I will just kind of put a brief description of what the situation is and then ask them specifically what they need from you. Okay. Okay it looks like this one's paid I think. Paid visa. Let's make sure this one gets paid. And it looks like okay yeah let's dang we charge nine bucks on a process and say that's well. Um it's credit card fee we get you we have to pay them all the time. But okay okay well I will send them because according to this it says let's see. Am trust I'm trying to find policy generation. Audit yeah let's see so it says. No it's not the right one I'm trying to find them. I'll see October twentieth um. Let's see. Yeah no so I was about to say um they emailed. I'm trying to find yeah so no yeah they said it right um. I'm trying to see where that little thing went like oh. I'll see where the the thing went. Because I want to make sure that I I want to make sure I email the right people. Does it have the thing on there for you or no? Let me look and see. Oh here we go let me see. If your audit was non cooperative. Oh yeah there's a phone number okay. Yeah I'll call them and and see I got an eight seven seven five two eight seventy eight seventy eight. Yes that's correct. Okay all right I'll get my call and then uh. Then see if I can do that from there I appreciate it thank you so much. Oh you're welcome if we can help with anything else let us know. Yes ma'am of course thank you. You too bye bye. Much.
