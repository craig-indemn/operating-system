Hello, this Jeff. Can I help you? Jeff, this is Bruce Murray. I have a policy through y'all, and it's Joe sold it to me and it's on my car dealership. Okay. What name? What's the name insured? It should be either French Broad Chevrolet or FBC Auto Group. That's what we're doing business as now. All right, French Broad or FBC. Okay, give me just a moment to get it pulled up for you. You doing okay? I am hope you are. Yeah, doing fine. All right, French Broad Chevrolet comes up. Good. Now let me pull policies. Okay, looks like we have you with auto owners. Correct. Okay, go ahead. What can I help you with? All right, so here is the deal. My wife has been for the last thirty nine years running or directing a preschool at the our local Methodist Church. Okay. Last week, the board of trustees wanted to meet with her and they told her that they wanted to she is welcome to continue using the church as the preschool but they want her to be solely liable for any responsibilities there. Okay, so is is the church basically just allowing her the space? They're not sponsoring the preschool or play school. It it it is a preschool and it was a you know she was under the impression the whole time she was she was hired by a committee from the church. Every hire every hire since then has been hired by a committee from the church. Okay. But nowhere in their bylaws or anything says about that they are the owners and responsible for that preschool and so they've gotten a new member in who moved in from out of town probably somewhere up north. And former attorney and she just is having a connection fit over that there is no separation between the two and that church. Do they do they realize how liable the church could be if something were to happen and she's got them that point. Yeah understood understood. I get it too, but in years past in years past it was like it was a mission of the church. Sure. Because the preschool has been the cost has been low and has not been comparable to other programs, even just daycares. But still, so my question is. She doesn't have a a corporation. She doesn't have a LLC. She doesn't have anything like that. Right. Is there a way to either and I am saying these things and I am using probably really wrong terminology but is there any way I can incorporate bring her into my corporation as an entity and then try to get an insurance policy for that program. Through y'all and through my my corporation. Are you talking about through the French Broad Chevrolet company? How how is that entity set up? Is it a corporation? Is that we're a we're a C Corp. Yeah. Well, you are looking at completely different exposures which could probably would cause an issue with the insuring company and it's not just the company we have you with now any company is going to look at. The additional exposure plus being something completely different than what the the exposure they accept it would be so I don't think that that is is a is an advisable way to go. Okay. I see that call. Yep, as far as how to direct you and and you know I've had some some experience in this sort of risk before with churches typically the church's. Insurance policy does account for the that type of exposure going on within the church usually but now they may have already the board may have already taken a look at this and. Conceivably, found that that is not the case. I am just speculate and I have no idea. All right, so Jeff. Go ahead. We had a we had no no I I jumped in on you but we we had a meeting with them Wednesday evening. Yep. And at at our local church, I am up the street at the Baptist Church and I am chair of the trustees up there. Okay. And we have the same company for our insurance—the Methodist Church and the Baptist Church. We all are using both of us are using Church Mutual. Yeah, okay, I am familiar with them. Yeah, I mean that that's that's that's widely widely you know known carrier for churches in our area. And and good and as let me let me tell you what we've done at our our church is a much larger facility and we got more options available to us but. We put in bunk beds up in our upstairs area. We've got three floors in the upstairs area. We put in bunk beds and with all these folks coming in to want to help with recovery of Helene. Sure. We we sleep probably somewhere close to anywhere from twenty to forty people upstairs in our church all summer every night except usually on weekends they travel back and another group comes in. Right. And you know we called Church Mutual and said, "Hey, this is what's happening. We need to have a rider added for to make sure they're protected
