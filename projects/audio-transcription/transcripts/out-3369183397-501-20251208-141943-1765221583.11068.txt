Hello. Uh huh. Exactly. Um, so just got off the phone with National General. Uh huh. They have filed the FS1 form to the DMV. Um, it it's effective ten ten of twenty twenty five. The reason I'm calling you though is because I don't think this is going to completely get you out of your headache. Um, looking in the system here, it looks like your policy that was with Progressive. And stop me if I'm wrong here, but what I'm looking at here in the system, it looks like your your Progressive policy expired on nine nineteen. But we didn't but but your National General policy didn't start until October 10th. I think you actually did have a break in coverage there. Unfortunately, does that? Do you remember that? Does that ring a bell? What happened was, and this is what we were doing when I um. Was renewing my policy. What I did was ask them for a cheaper policy, and they were looking into it. But I didn't think I had a lapse in coverage. Oh, okay. Well, I don't know. Um, from what I can see here, it looks like. Let me just make sure there's nothing else in here. I don't I don't see anything there. That's a um. Okay, so so so good and bad, right? Here's the good and the bad, right? Good news. Good news is the DMV now has an FS1 on hand. From National General, it's dated ten ten of twenty twenty five. Okay. So that that checks the box there of providing proof to them of your active coverage. Uh huh. However, the bad news is. If your Progressive policy and I believe it did based on what I'm looking at here, it looks like your Progressive policy ended on nine nineteen of twenty twenty five. Okay, so so if it ended in September, but your Nat Gen policy didn't start until October 10th. That means that technically speaking, you did actually have a lapse in coverage. For sure, Bridget, honey, they're still going to find you fifty dollars for having a lapse in coverage. So the reason I'm calling you back is because I wanted you to to know that that still might be there. Okay. And and you might not be like the FS1 form. All it does is it shows the DMV that Bridget has active coverage. Right. There's a state law, state statute law, having to look at it that says you have to have continuous coverage. And when there's a break in that coverage, the DMV finds you a civil penalty of fifty dollars per vehicle. So I don't know if they're going to catch all three vehicles. I don't know what I I can't see any of the DMV information from my. I'm the insurance agent, right? So what I would suggest is absolutely do call them back. Tomorrow Wednesday morning at some point, and just make sure that they've got that received in their system. You may still and probably based on what I see here, you probably will still owe a fine to the DMV. This form. It's going to check the box, but it won't get you out of the fine. Okay. Okay. And unfortunately, honey, you can't run from that. You know, even the fine people do try to run from it. They don't want to pay it. You know, it happens right. But but they'll chase you. They will eventually they'll revoke everything. They'll send you. You don't work if you don't pay it. It's ridiculous. But um. And that. And I don't mind paying that. I just needed to make sure that I was okay. And so I just needed to make sure I'm clear. I just thought that maybe I needed to do something with y'all. Now um. The only thing you were supposed to do use right all so we can file that form for you yeah. Okay. The only other thing that I'm I'm wondering is now because they had a issue with my draft that still didn't have anything to do with their break in coverage. I just want to make sure. Um. Not well, no. Um. Because your your your National General policy is currently set up on auto pay off of a credit card. Looks like payment was on December 2nd, and it took 238 dollars and 26 cents of your money. So it it went through there. Um. Again, the the frustrating part here that I think you're going to have with the DMV is that your Progressive policy ended. The Nat Gen policy started. Okay. I am certainly not fussing actually. I I want to I want to help you right. Yes. I what I'll say is this Bridget, anytime like auto insurance is the one policy that gets people in trouble because it's tied to the
