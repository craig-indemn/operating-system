Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hi, my name is Debrason Cabbage, and I have a question about my homeowners that we have through Alliance, and we just received a new statement for the month of September, and the payment amount has gone up substantially, and I was just wondering if someone could explain up to me why it went up. Okay, all right, Debra. Yeah, let me put you on hold for an agent. I do have a couple of people that have just literally called in at the same time. So when I put you on hold, if it goes to a voicemail, if someone's not able to take your call right now at the moment, if you'll leave a voicemail that goes directly to an agent and they can give you a call back, is that okay, Debra? Yeah, sure. Okay, all right, hold on just a moment. Thanks.
