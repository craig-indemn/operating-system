Hello, this is Kobe. Hey Kobe, good afternoon Jeff Edmonds with Alliance. Hey Jeff, how's going? Doing good hope you are. Hey yeah. I got I got the quote on the risk that we talked about yesterday the Dale Folk. Yes. And I emailed back and I didn't know if it'd gotten to you and he was kind of wanting an answer so I thought I'd follow up with a call. On that general liability part, I can't remember what we actually said yesterday. Are we? Is it necessary that we include both of those lines? That I included because. I didn't think it was but you you direct me here. You know it's not. Um. It's not completely necessary. Well, here is the deal. It sounds like this isn't just a warehouse. It sounds like he's he's consigning things online. On auction and. You know warehouses from our perspective are for things in long term storage or. Um for storing things. Right. And. In reality, this guy's running a business. Um. So you know, like, does he have a website? Is he? What website is he using for the sales or the auction? Yes, to both of those questions and it looks like to me he's more along the lines of antique stores than he would be warehouse. And I'm I'm fine with deleting the warehouse line of that risk. Uh and also the premium basis that is showing for the antique part of that is 50, 000. It's going to be closer to the 10, 000 and I think that was what was on my accord was 10, 000 but I didn't know if that 50 might have been a minimum amount that had to be shown. Yeah, so I'm glad you called. I was I was going to call you and talk about the quote too. You gave me to it. That's all right. I put that to 50k to provide some rate relief because we are at minimum premium. So if I had made that just you know 10, 000. The rate would be way higher so. This will be audited right and. If he comes back and let's say he does like 60, 000 in sales. Well that sixty that extra 50k if we were to use 10, 000. Is then going to be audited based on a much higher rate instead of the the rate for 50k. Okay. So we ran with the 50, 000 of. Basis there for the antique stores and removed the warehouse line. Is that livable? I mean that seems to be more in line with what he's doing. Yeah I I think that's fine I can do that. Here is what I'm thinking. And it doesn't look like this building's very big. No, it's like 2, 400 square feet I think something like that 2425 I'm going on memory now. So what I would do is. Ask him if part of this building is used as a warehouse and part of it is. Used as like a storefront, which I know it really isn't. Right, people just come to pick up their stuff. Yeah, that's all. That's the only reason anyone else other than himself would be on the premises because everything's done completely online. Matter of fact, I can send you the link to the online site if that helps you here. That would be great actually. Yeah I can do that. And is the property part of this required that he purchase or is there any connection between the two lines? They are completely separate quotes. He does not have to take the property quote that I sent at all. Okay. Yeah so if he wants to take both or just one totally fine. Got it. And. So so here's the exposure when when I'm looking at this for the antique. Class code we're we're thinking you know slip and falls bodily injury. Stuff like that, but so for your typical antique store. And the the benefit of that class code too is it's it's an auditable class code so that's kind of why it's it is good to have both of those on there. Is because this warehouse class code is not really is not going to be audited that square footage isn't going to change but he does have a sales component. Which we need to factor in because warehouse that warehouse class code is not going to contemplate any. Any actual selling of. Of the products right so I think the issue he's going to have with is the price because the warehouse part of that is driving you know it's it's sitting at 1500. And the antique store is at seven well actually 750 dollars roughly half. And that seems to be more in line with what he's doing
