Sorry, if you are holding, is Cody to help you. Hey Cody, it's Anna calling you back. Hey Anna, how are you? Good. How are you doing? I am good. Okay, so you got my email that I sent with the quote right. And you had a question about the drivers on the quote. Yeah. Okay, so it has Louise and Juan both as drivers on the policy on the quote. On the quote. Yeah. Okay. Is that fine? You want both of them on there, is that right? Yeah. Okay. I was just making sure he was on the quote he was added in there if not if we could get a quote with them added. Yeah, so I've got both of the drivers on there, and then I've got the two thousand eighteen RAM thirty five hundred the two thousand eighteen trailer Cardinal trailer, and then the two thousand eighteen Ford F one hundred and fifty was the new truck I believe right. Yeah, that's right. So the old, the old Allstate, and I am sorry about Allstate policy. Look, I, I hate Allstate with a passion to be honest with you. They're very difficult, and apparently they've not renewed your policy. Never let us know. Won't give us any information about it. I don't really know what to be honest with you. Like we don't have hardly any commercial. We've got some personal line stuff with them, but we don't really have commercial stuff with them anymore. So I guess they've like completely rescinded our commercial appointment or something. Because they said we don't even have an agency code or anything with them anymore. So I don't really know what happened there. So I apologize. Did you not receive anything in the mail from them or anything? No, and the thing is, I think the NC Carports' email was linked to. Was used for it. Yeah. Okay. Which thank god nothing happened throughout the year. Completely agree. Well, I guess he went a full year without paying for any insurance at least. Yeah, that's a pro. But I am glad nothing happened. Definitely pay attention to your you know just your bank account to make sure you know all you know you got Westfield the Ohio farmers insurance group is who Westfield is so make sure you know that one's coming out each month. And the Travelers Workers Comp, and then obviously once we start the Auto Owners Policy, just make sure those are obviously coming out each month. And if there is an issue, obviously you can always reach out and we can check on something. But yeah, I am glad nothing happened for sure. Let's see. The total for the year was seventy seven fifteen fifty six, which is basically exactly what your Allstate was with just the one truck and trailer. So it's obviously a good amount cheaper to cover two trucks in a trailer for the same price. So that's good at least. And you are going to use a checking account information to set this up and make make the first payment correct. Yeah, on a monthly basis, which I think was six forty three a month. And we're going to issue this effective today. I got to go back and change that. Okay, I got back. Eleven four today. You've been doing well. Yeah. Have you been doing? Oh, not too bad. Just busy busy as always. That's good though. Yep, how's the installation go? Are y'all working for NC Carports still or who y'all working for now? Uh no, it's another manufacturer. I don't know the name. My husband's doing that handles all that. Okay. I guess they have a certificate for you already. I assume. They haven't asked for it yet. Okay. Once they do, I'll reach out. Yeah. Now that we're issuing a new policy, obviously it's good for them to have the updated policy information with the business auto too. You said you are not sure which one he's working for right now. No, I'll get the certificate holder information and I'll send it over. You got my email address. The Cody at my alliance insurance. You have that. Yeah. If you'll send that information to me, then I can I can send it to you or you can provide an email address for me and I can get that to whoever needs to go to wherever he's working. I'll get that sent out whenever you get that over to me. Is it twenty two twenty one Shore Road in Yakindville? Is that the correct address? Uh, what is on the on the quote? I don't remember which one. The twenty two twenty one Shore Road Yakindville, North Carolina is what's on the quote. I know there is a Hampton Road or something a different address. Yeah, no, just keeps the twenty two twenty one. That's where he keeps the trucks. Gotcha. Okay. And so we're going
