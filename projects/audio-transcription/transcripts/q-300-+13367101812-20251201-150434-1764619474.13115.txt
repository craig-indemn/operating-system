Thank you for holding. This is Jacy. How may I help you? Hey, this is Travis Hudson. I sold my car today, and I did return the plate, and I guess I'm trying to cancel my insurance policy. Okay, say that one more time. You said that you you did what with your car. I sold my car today, and I. Yeah, and I did return the plate, and I'm trying to I guess cancel the insurance policy on it. Okay, was that the only vehicle on that policy? I believe so. I don't think my wife is on that policy. I'll double check. Okay. If you don't mind just confirming your address for me, please Travis. Um, it's one zero five two Manor Haven Drive Durham, North Carolina two seven seven zero three. Thank you. It's loading, so just bear with me here. Yeah, all good. Thank you. I I do have the policy number in front of me. If that helps, just let me know. Oh no, I've got the policy number. It was just a computer loading, but I appreciate that. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. All right, I've got a 2019 Kia Forte on your. Yes. Yes, that's the one. All right, and when do we turn in the plates? Today. Okay. Love it or actually twelve one now. Yep. Okay. Yeah, looks like that is the only vehicle on the policy. So what I'll do is I'll I'm gonna have to send you a cancellation form, for you to sign. Okay. And then we can go ahead and process cancellation. I've got tw hudson eighty seven at gmail dot com. Yes, that's correct. Okay, I'll send it over to that email and it'll come from Congressine. And what it is is just a cancellation form. Your e sign. It'll be returned. To me, and then I'll go ahead and I'll submit that. Okay, perfect. Is there anything that I need to do after that? Or just just fill out the form. Um. If. If Safeco, um, once the billing is updated, I'm not sure if they'll send like a final bill. Okay. But there's nothing else that has to be done on our end. It's just submitting not that form, or canceling the policy, and then if they need anything else, they'll send you a final bill. But other than that, that would be it. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it, Travis. Yeah, have a great rest of your day. You too. Thank you. Bye.
