Thank you. We're holding this Heather. Hey Heather, this is Debbie Franklin. Hey Debbie, how's it going, girl? It's all pretty good. I hope you're doing good. I am. Yeah, I was on vacation my sweet, and I believe you. Did Jamie give you a call and do a review or? I think you. No, he hasn't called me back to let me know of anything that could be better. Then you know I. Yeah, I had that bill of eight hundred and forty some dollars for the. He said it was just for liability and. It had gone up, so I didn't know if maybe there was something else we could look at to get it better. So I emailed you. I've been working on it and I emailed you some proposals. Oh, okay. Thing, let me. I just sent that over to you a little bit ago. Hold on, let me get you pulled up again. Okay. Yeah, I think it was your home that went up significantly. That. Well, my my liability insurance went up too. I think it was seven hundred something last time when I signed up with you and then it went up eight hundred something now. I'd have to sign my. No, I got it right here. It was. Yep, it was. It's eight fourteen. Yeah. For the year, so I have got you a proposal with Pen National. Yeah, just emailed it to you. Let me pull that up. But I can definitely I can't save you that much on the auto but the homeowners I can definitely save you. Um. Well. So I can get your home at fourteen thirty one. And I think it was. Let's see. Yeah, I've got those papers in here. I'm going to go get them. Um. It was with Travelers. I know that. Yes. Yeah, we have both your home and auto are both with Travelers. Your renewal on the homeowners is what went up significantly. Um, it went up to seventeen thirty three. Yeah, seventeen. Uh huh. Yeah. So the proposal I sent you. Is fourteen thirty one. Would that make my house payment lower? Well, the the the one I sent you is fourteen thirty one. You're currently PM this past year. It was thirteen eighty two. So not much of a difference. Should. Stay the same. Now I can get the premium lower. I've got a thousand dollar deductible. Um, we could bump that thousand dollar deductible up to twenty five hundred. Well, what's the seventeen thirty three for? I thought that was the home. That's your new wall. It is your homeowners. That's your renewal with Travelers. Yeah, but that that's included in my house payment. That amount for each month. Well, that's the renewal. Yeah, seventeen thirty three. If you decide to keep Travelers and keep that, absolutely. Um, that'll be figured in. And what I'm saying though is your current policy this year's term. Um, twenty four to twenty five was thirteen eighty two. And that was the thirteen eighty two was for I thought that was a a different amount that could be for my home insurance. That at thirteen eighty two was your your policy premium for this twenty four to twenty five year. That's what it is. Thirteen eighty two is what it was. Oh. I was saying it was thirteen eighty two this year for the twenty four to twenty five term. Yeah. Oh, and it and it's going up to seventeen thirty three. Right. Yeah, that's why. Okay, that's why I did it. Looks more significant than the auto. Um, but yes. All right. Sorry about that, Daddy. I was. That's okay. Trying to reach me. Yeah, there's. Um, your homeowners went up three hundred and fifty one dollars. If we if you can, what with your house. Yeah. Okay. So the quote I sent you was pretty close to what your current term is. It was fourteen. Okay, and my house payment would stay the same with the new one. Should yeah yeah it's the new. Um. What was it? Fourteen thirty one. So yeah. Yeah. Um. And then the auto. Let's see. All right, and then the auto. Um, if we decided to switch. Switch it over. It would be seven twenty eight sixty eight. Okay. That would be a. That would be a little bit of. Yeah, it's back down to what you know we currently have from both slightly a little bit more, but not like Travelers to increase that Travelers have. Right. Okay. Well, yeah. Let's let's do that then. Okay. Did you well the only situation situation for PM? Is your key you still have the key? Right. Yeah. Is it do you have a push button start? No. You know
