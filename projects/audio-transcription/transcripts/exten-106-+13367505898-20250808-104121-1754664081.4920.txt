Hello. Um, this is Maggie from Negative Brothers. Hey Maggie, how are you? I'm good. How are you? Also good. Um, I just had a question. Um, because our, we had to pay the workers' comp, uh, payment. It would do the twenty-four, I think, or twenty-six. I'm not sure that month. And we were not able to pay it. I wanted to see how like how much time do we have to pay it before like it goes out for cancellation. Hey, yeah. Um. So yeah, it I thought that it was on autopay. Is that not what Gloria um informed you the last time you guys spoke? No, it's not. On autopay. Oh, it's not. Oh, okay. Uh, give me one moment. Let me. Let me try to get a photo. Actually, Gloria is a little bit more familiar with the billing system than me. So if you don't mind, I can have her give you a call right back so she can take that payment from you. Okay. Um and then while I have you on the phone, I was going to send you guys an email today. Um, did you guys decide on the general liability? Um, I know. Yeah, I think we're going to end up getting it, but it's just that um they send them a check. Uh, to get the down payment, but um, for some reason his bank every time he gets a check they always put it on hold. Oh okay. Yeah, so the thing is that um, since it's on hold, it's not going to be available until the 18th. So that's why we're calling also because. Um, we're not going to be able to make the payment until the 18th. Okay, let me um. Well, first I'll go ahead and gather all the documents to make it easier for the day that you're ready, just so we can have everything ready to go. And let me ask them if we were to issue it now, if the down payment can be made like on the 18th and the coverage can go ahead and start now. Um. So I'll ask about that and get back with you. In case that's what I want to do. Okay, that's fine. Okay. I will talk to this. Maggie either way. Okay. Thank you, and I'll let Gloria know to give you a call back to make the payment. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Thank you.
