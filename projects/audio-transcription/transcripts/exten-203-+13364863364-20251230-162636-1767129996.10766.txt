Alliance Insurance Services. This is Maria. Hi Maria, this is Mary Baker. How are you doing? I'm very good. How are you? Good. My dad reached out to you yesterday. I was trying to reach out about writers insurance quotes. We looked over the quote that you gave us. I emailed you yesterday. I don't know if it might have gotten lost or something. But the quote is just a lot of coverage that, unlike we think, it's a little bit high in the coverage for the. What I'm requiring for my property, and like I'm fine with everything else. It's just a 500, 000. I don't need to be that high. If there is possibility, I can get a quote that's a little bit closer to what the writers insurance seems like 100, 000. Everything else was fine again. Whatever works in your wheelhouse. Also, I do apologize. I'm in a little bit of a pinch. I need to try to get it done before like five. I'm so sorry that I'm putting you in a pinch right now. Today. Yes, if that's okay. I'm so sorry. Or like five thirty. That's fine. I just need to try to get things done. I've been at work all day today. Yeah, no worries. No worries, and unfortunately no that that I mean the carriers that we have they won't allow anything less than 500, 000 written standalone. Gotcha. Okay, so 500, 000. I mean that's still fine. So then just doing it that way. Okay. Then I'll look at the quote again and see if we can do anything else. In that regard, but that should be. I just wanted to see because again. Like it's fine. It's just a lot of. Yeah, understand. Understand. Yes. Just let me know if you if you decide if you want to go ahead with it. We we have it saved in the file so we just have to print it out. Perfect. Right. Cool. Okay. We'll let you know as soon as I can. I just gotta make some more calls. But have a good rest of your day. You too. Thank you. Bye bye. Alright. So bye.
