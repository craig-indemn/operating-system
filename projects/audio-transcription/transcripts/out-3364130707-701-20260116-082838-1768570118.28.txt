Hope you had a great week, and wanted to get with you about getting some information to get the life insurance going that we had discussed a couple months back. You'd asked me to call it to the first of the year. Give me a call back, please at three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. That's three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. The phone conversation with me shouldn't take more than the very most would be ten minutes. So if you could just give me a call at that number. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you so much.
