Hello, this Jeff. Can I help you? Hi Jeff, this is Christy and auto owners. How are you? Hey, great. How are you, Christy? I am good. Thank you. Hey, I am calling on a it's a renewal review, coming up for the M five group. Yes. Okay, so I have in the notes that there was a fire and they've been doing like renovations and stuff, and that it could be completed in August. Do you have any updates for me on this building? I do. I was looking at this actually earlier in the week with Stan Marion, who's one of our employees. He's he is the M five group as well. So. Basically, three of the four tenants have now moved back in, and the fourth should be in by the end of the month. So I was kind of holding off on responding to your email because I think I had a little bit of time, but I was going to let that happen. The fire extinguishers I think you would ask about are in place. And what else was I am not looking at your email. Yeah, another underwriter did that. Um, it says based on the results. This construction is complete. Please ensure adequate number of tags fire extinguishers. Oh, there is a handrail needed in the back rear stairway. Um. Let's see. Stan mentioned that he had an issue with putting that handrail there because of how the city would respond to it being the age of the building. And I don't know he he just seemed to have an issue with whether or not he was going to be allowed to put that in by the city. And I don't think he has plans to do that. Is there something he could be willing to do that? That's what I am wondering because well I am just thinking because I know my dad is throwing down stuff like that without a handrail. So I am not sure what what could be if he just hesitant about going to. I think he's worried about the city having an issue with it and stirring up more. It's something to do with code I believe. And it's not it's not an entrance that the public uses. They come in the front door. That was another rationale he gave me too, and this was just in conversation. We we actually share space here in the office in Mount Area and they you know they were actually having a grand opening of that a grand reopening of that building day before yesterday. And I was going through the M five underwriting and just we were just kind of talking about it so. Okay. So I would. Yep. Okay, I'll put a note in there just how. Um. It's only employ I would imagine only employees that are only employees that come in the back door that use the step. Um. So minimal exposure, none at all for for the client. How can you send me photos of the fire extinguishers when you get the opportunity? And then what ended up going? What are the three tenants so far? Is it the clothing stores something? I know one's a bakery because he brought cookies from the bakery day before yesterday. The other another is his wife's Juju's clothing store. Oh, I did see that. Yeah. Okay. And I am not sure what the third one is. I'd be guessing. Okay. Okay. All right. So so yeah, when you get time, I'll just put it up. I'll push it through to renew because at first I was like, "Oh, it's bacon. I am going to have a candle look one." No, it's bacon. But this was good to hear. Yeah, yeah. Good to hear. Okay, so then I'll just put a note in there that will follow up with you again later on with occupant and then I'll make a note about the step so hopefully they won't say anything about that again and then just send me some pictures of the fire extinguishers. That sounds good. Okay. All right, thanks, Christy. I appreciate you checking. You are welcome. All right. No problem. Have a good weekend. You too. Bye bye.
