By random checks. Thank you for holding this. Is Brandi? How can I help you? Yes, my name is Dan Suter. We have auto and homeowners policy with you all, and I got a letter through the Department of Transportation here in North Carolina that they want an FS one. Submitted electronically for our Toyota Rav4. Okay, give me one second. Okay. You probably need to pull my account stuff. Can you verify your mailing address for me, please, Dan? Or six nine nine two, Saratoga Court, in Summerfield, North Carolina, two seven three five eight. And officially, it's Desmond Daniel Suter. I go by Dan. It's my middle name. Yes, we do have Desmond on your actual policy just in our system. We see that you got by Dan. Okay, and that letter that you got from the DMV. What date does it have on there that says that your policy was terminated or insurance was terminated? Well, it doesn't say anything about policy being terminated. It just says as for proof of coverage effective eleven eighteen twenty twenty five when I renewed our. You know registration form. Okay, um, can would you be able to take a picture of that letter and text it in to us that way we can have a look at it. That way we get all the information correct and then we're able to double check on it with the DMV. That'd be fine. Where do I send that to? Yeah, so the phone number is going to be three three six seven eight six one one three three. Okay, and for clarification perspectives, this letter was dated twelve nineteen. December nineteenth, we left for two and a half week trip cross country for holidays. We left on the seventeenth, returned on December thirty first, and received your mail on January second. And they said this must be submitted electronically, new later than twelve twenty nine, twenty twenty five. So just for clarification purposes, I guess we still just submit electronically and see what happens. Yeah, so that yeah, so that's what we have to do on our side, and since getting that letter and letting us look at it and then we can follow up on it, we're able to let you know if everything has been cleared or if there's something else that you need to follow up with with the DMV. So we'll let you know after we send it. Which it it typically takes about twenty four hours for them to receive it. So then we'll let you know either by tomorrow or Wednesday, but you should be able to be good to drive the vehicle. Okay. Good. Thank you. You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with, Dan? No, I appreciate your help. Thank you. You're welcome. I hope you have a great day. Thanks. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye.
