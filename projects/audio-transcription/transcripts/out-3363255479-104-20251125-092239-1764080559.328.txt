This is Megan. Hey Megan, it's Brian at Alliance Insurance. How are you? Hey, I'm good. How are you? Good. Morning, morning. Well, just a question about the invoice. Was it more than likely mailed to that 401 South Main Street? You know what? I'm just trying to figure out if we missed it somewhere because I guess the lady. That kind of does the administrative work for M and A. Got an email saying that the policy was expired, so of course now they're not happy with me. But would it have already canceled? When we're basically only three days late. Yeah, well, no, so it has not canceled. So. Okay. The the due date is November 22nd. That's three days ago. That. No, they're not going to cancel it over that. Okay. You've got plenty of time. I sort of I found this out. Fairly late, you know, Amani left and he was the one managing that, so they were sending everything to his email. Right, and and that's the only reason I even got nervous is because I knew I had been dealing with him and then I knew he he was not. There anymore. That's right. Yeah. Do I need to change that? Should I change the address to the PO box 1308 or do you want it still going to 401 South Main Street? Well, there's no I don't think there's a mail reciprocal there. Is the only reason I was asking if that's where it would have gotten mailed to. So yeah, if you want to change it to the PO box 1308, that that's good. Okay. Yeah, and then you can. I'll send this where it needs to go. Okay, perfect. Yeah, so but yeah, you guys are all squared away. We just we found it last week. Right before it was going to expire, so everything's fine with the policy. You got time to pay. Okay, that's all I need to know. Okay. All right, thank you so much, Brian. Good day. You too. Bye bye.
