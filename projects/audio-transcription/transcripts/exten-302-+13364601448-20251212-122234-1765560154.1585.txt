Thank you for holding. This is Anna. I can help you. Hi Anna Sherif at the Hartford. How you doing? Hey, I'm good. How are you? Doing good. I'm driving, so I didn't want to leave you hanging. You're gonna have to go back into the customer record and change the location to whatever state it is that you're looking to quote that lesser risk for. Okay. So if you want me to stay on the phone with you, I'm happy to walk you through it. But you're gonna click the name of the basically the customer record. You're gonna edit, which is gonna be on the top right hand side. And then that will open up to allow you to quote. So even. Okay, so even though it because it specifically asks for street mailing, even though that's the mailing address, I still need to put in the physical. Okay. When you created the customer record, you put in the mailing address in Florida, and then the system automatically carries over the location state. But when you go into the customer record, you will notice it will ask you what is the predominant state. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, everybody overlooks it. I see that now. I changed it, and now I can quote it because I was like, "Wait a minute, I thought Hartford likes the lesser risks." And they want to give me the stop sign. I was like, "I did something wrong." Yeah, anytime you get a stop sign, it is going to be state specific. So Florida, maybe Texas, maybe California, New York. You may get those stop signs, and then it depends on the class code too. So that's why it's always state specific. But yeah, in this particular case, that's what you did. We should be okay on that one. I believe you're gonna put it in as a retail. Is it restaurant? Yeah, it's just it's just three of them, and they're just your typical chicken salad, chick or whatever. Let's say Japanese and one other restaurant. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you will. I don't know if you'll classify it. Yeah, I think. Because the other one I found was the Builder Lesser Risk Shopping Centers Less than 10 Stores. That it is. I wonder if the restaurant carries a little bit more rate. Anyway, rate it up how you think it needs to be rated. Okay, for three of them. Uh and yeah, maybe select the restaurant. Okay. Okay, let me do that and then we'll see where I get. Okay. Yeah, sounds good. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. You're very welcome. Have a good one. You too. All right. Bye.
