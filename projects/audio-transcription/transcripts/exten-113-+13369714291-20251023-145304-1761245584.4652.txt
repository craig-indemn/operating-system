Thank you for holding this hearing. Hey Gary, it's Courtney with the Boyer Boyermark Chamber. How are you doing? I'm sorry, this is Courtney Wheeler. I'm calling you about my my homeowner's insurance. Okay. You doing okay today? I am. Are you? I'm doing good. I've got my payment information. Okay. Go ahead and let me get that, please. Okay, great. Um, let's see the bank account number, the routing number. It's the Civic Federal Credit Union. And the routing number is two five three one eight four five three seven. Okay, let me read it back: two five three one eight four five three seven. Correct. Okay. And the account number is one zero seven seven five four two four. Seven five four two four. Okay. Now remind me again, Courtney, you you want which pay plan do you want for it? I'm gonna I'd like to pay the so the homeowner's. I don't. Oh gosh, what was that? I don't know what. How much it will be a month? If it is it more, if I just do it monthly, quarterly, what is this? Well, they charge you a fee when you when you break it up into installments. So that that fee is going to be probably a couple dollars a month to do that, unless you go on a bank draft. And I'm assuming that's what you want to do. Yeah, I want to do bank draft. I just gave you my bank draft. Okay. That I can go ahead and process all that when we release the application. Okay. And you will get the documents to your email to sign. Okay. And you just sign those for us, and it comes back to me automatically. But we'll make sure we get it in place so it you don't have any laps on anything. Yeah. I appreciate that so much. If you have any questions, yeah. It'll just be a monthly bank draft, and it won't be costing any extra since I'm doing a monthly bank draft. If they charge anything, it'll be like a dollar. Okay. I mean, I think twelve dollars is worth a monthly payment, but if I need to pay it in full, you know. When you get this stuff, if you have any questions, you just call me back. Okay. I sure will. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Thank you. Take care. Bye bye. Bye bye.
