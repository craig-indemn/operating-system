Hello, hello, David. Yes. Hi there, David. My name's Jamie. I am an agent here with Life Insurance. We have your auto policy. I should be have two auto policies written for my office. And this afternoon, just to do some really simple review with you. I need to make sure all your information is still up to date in the system. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. If so, let me just now walk in. Let me walk in my office real quick. Okay, I'm gonna be real quick with this. I promise. And this is a bad time. I can certainly push. No, I'm good. I just walk in my office. Okay, good deal. I'm gonna run through this real quick, David. Stop me, interrupt me if anything needs to change. You can update it for you. Phone number seems like it works just fine. Email is grayf at parkwayford dot com. Yep, one six three Axton Creek Drive in Moresby, North Carolina two eight one one five is your mailing address. Is all that still good information there? Yep, fantastic. Okay, so I've got two auto policies active for you. Your primary auto is with National General. It's coming up for renewal on January 24th. There's currently three drivers on the policy. I've got you, Christina and William Ferguson all show up. There's currently three vehicles that have full coverage on them. You have a 23 Ford Bronco, a 2014 Ford Fusion, and a 25 Ford F150 Raptor Edition. Those vehicles have comp with a 500 deductible. You've got collision with a 500 deductible. There's no rental. There's no towing on any of the vehicles. And then the only vehicle that shows up with a lien holder is the Raptor. It's financed at Third Bank. Yeah, I don't know. I'm probably gonna pay it off too. I'm just bought it, but I ain't gonna see and pay interest. Do I have to call you back and let you know? Then don't have the lien there. Yeah, yeah, that that that um, if that lien is active, then the bank would be mad at us for deleting. So I would just go ahead and take care of whatever you got to take care of. No, I'm saying I need to call you back once I pay it off. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah, we will not get notified of that at all. You know you'll have to call us and tell us unfortunately. Okay, cool. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I do just want to make sure there's no exposure to you guys. Do y'all use any of these vehicles for any kind of like business usage? Any Uber driving, Lyft driving, DoorDash, Amazon. No, I mean, it's just none of them really get driven. I drive a company car, so. My wife doesn't work, so the you know son. I mean, my son drives like he's 16. He drives a fusion. He drives it three or four miles to school and back. So okay, I just look all three of those vehicles are on here for pleasure usage, which is the cheapest way to actually. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I just I just drive a company car, so she actually gets one too. My wife, but we don't normally take two off a lot, but. Got you, got you. All good there. I also have a Haggerty policy on your Haggerty policy. There is a. I just go past it 2004 Ford Mustang Mach One Edition. You do have comp and collision on that vehicle as well. And looking at this one, yeah, the only driver that shows up on this policy is you. Yeah, nobody. I got cost this in the garage with a car cover on it. It's got 30 000 miles on it. It may get driven. Twice a year. Wow, wow. I hope I bet that thing's pretty too. Okay. Anything else? That that's the only two policies I have in the system for you. I don't have any homeowners information. There's no. There's no toy policies in Ford. You know golf cart skidders none of that. Anything, anything you need quoted at this time? Anything you're missing? Not that I think, not that I know of. I'm probably gonna buy a boat next year, so I guess I'll need to get that stuff together when I do that. Okay, that's that's fairly. I've never even had one. What are they? Are they pretty pricey or what are they? Like a regular. Nah, well, I guess it depends on what you're buying. You know, if you're buying some kind of
