Hello. Miss Edz, I have your phone number memorized already. You'll go home and be dreaming about it. There we go. What did you find out? Okay, so I did leave you a message. She said to send over a copy of the policy. My fax or email. Okay. And I've got the fax number is eight six six. We don't use the fax, so let me let me type email. So the email. Okay, the email is CarringtonCovered dot com. I am covered. Yeah, I like I am just yeah I am I am covered. Just I I am covered. Yeah, yes. Okay. CarringtonCovered dot com. She said to send over a copy of the policy. Um and then check with the safe code and cancel that no which I know you know how to do all that stuff I said they take care of that I don't ever have to worry about that. You sign off on that which I'll tell you about that in a minute so just go ahead and finish up. Yeah and then she said what they'll do is they'll issue the check for the insurance part. Okay. But then when safe code refunds me, then I'm to send that to them. Okay, got you. I don't know what that means really exactly how that works but I just I mean I gathered what I was supposed to do when I get a check I'm to send it to them. Okay now here here is the process and I will get this done for you tomorrow okay. Okay. I don't have enough time to do it this late in the day but I will do it in the morning when I come in. Um. Your email. I will be sending you a couple of different emails and they're all for signatures okay. Okay. Okay. Electronic signatures so it should not be a big issue but there will be a couple of them. Okay. The application and the cancel request. Has to be signed by you for us to send in and all that. Now. Okay. Once the policy is issued with Grange. You can expect within two weeks. That somebody from Grange. Might be lurking outside your house because they will come by. They will come by and take pictures and things like that. Okay. So yeah yeah I know they have before. You see a stranger out there messing around. And they do that just to follow up on the information that we've already given them. Now I pulled up some pictures at your house. Do you have any outbuildings or anything? Yes I've got two. One of them in the back needs to be torn down. Um. This one that's here at my driveway it's it's brand new. Um. Practically brand new anyways the one in the back. I mean it's it it holds my lawn mower and just my garden tools. Um. It's not in the greatest of shape. No. Is it is it um is it a wooden structure or a metal or what? Yes. It is wooden. Both are wooden. Well what normally happens when they do that walk around? If there's anything suspect on there, then they will exclude coverage on it. Now that does not mean they will exclude coverage of anything you have in the building, but they may exclude the building itself just because of the condition. Yeah well and that sign of that lower one as long as you know I'm really I'm really not concerned about insurance on that other one. I've got the insurance on the one so I'm really not concerned about the other one. Okay really I mean I've been saying it needs to be pushed off or something but it kind of holds just what I need it to hold to keep from getting it wet and it's you know. Well the contents will still be covered even if they exclude the building. So. Okay. That's one. In both of them anyway. Okay well I know the one at the bottom they may say something about but this one here at the driveway it they shouldn't say anything about it. Well trust me they will let me know if if anything happens and I know your phone number now so I'll be able to get back in touch. Okay that sounds fantastic. If you have any questions. On any of the documents that you get, just call me back and let me know otherwise I'll just plan on processing this thing in the morning. And you'll be set. And now you know you know your effective dates will run differently now. So instead of running from March to March you're going to run from November to November. Oh okay. Well that kind of runs right with my taxes huh. Yeah. Kind of runs right together I guess either way it's coming on my check every month it don't matter to me. If you think about anything or anything comes up that you have a question about you just call me back and let me know otherwise I'll go ahead and proceed with everything tomorrow. Sounds great thank
