Yes, this message is for Bobby and Karen. This is Brandi with Alliance Insurance. Just trying to reach out to you to review over your home and auto policies. Your home is coming up for renewal in February, and there are some changes that we need to make a month before to get you ready. Due to the current company that you're with is pulling out of North Carolina, so we do have to move your homeowner's insurance to a different company. If you would please just give us a call back at three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thanks and have a great day.
