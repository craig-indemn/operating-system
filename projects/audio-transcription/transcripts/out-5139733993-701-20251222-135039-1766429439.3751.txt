Hello, you've reached Heather Circum, personal lines underwriter for the Cincinnati Insurance Companies. Unfortunately, I've missed your call. Please feel free to leave me a detailed voicemail or to send me a follow up email and I will get to either one as soon as possible. Thank you and have a nice day. Please leave a message after the tone. When you have finished, please hang up or press the pound key for more options. Good afternoon, Heather. This is just Jeremy calling from Alliance Insurance Services in North Carolina. Hope you're doing well. I am building a proposal and ready to present the final proposal to a gentleman with your company. And the quote number for home is QH one one three eight two three zero three. One one three eight two three zero three, Rich McCullit. And upon reading the clue report, there was a wind claim at the residency's purchasing but not filed by himself. And it changed the rate on the homeowners by a few hundred bucks, three hundred or so to be honest. Wanted to see if we could get that corrected or what needs to be done. How that can not impact the premium or if I'm just missing something obvious there. You can email or call me of course. The number here is three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thank you very much. Hope you're doing well. Talk to you soon. Thanks.
