Sorry for your hold. This is Cody. May help you. Hey Cody, it's Vanessa. Hey, how are you? I'm good. I was just calling because you had forwarded the email about what we were talking about the workers comp and all that, the private stuff. To Victor and Yadera. Wait, hold on. Because you responded to everybody and you sent all this the thread. Well, you would ask about. Can you send the installment page for the business auto and bill so you can show it? Right, but we were talking about the workers comp and that they didn't have anything to do with that part of it. Oh, oh. Yeah. Um. I don't think you can. Not send it back, right? No, I can't now. It's because it was that whole email chain that was in there. I was trying. I was trying to just forward that part about the business auto. Bill and stuff. Um. I guess because they didn't know that you didn't have workers comp. No, no, no, no. It was just um. I think I had said something about business like it was just like. In general, no, they knew about the other part. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I was just trying to just send that to you and to them because I think that you were asking about. The installment schedule or whatever, and I just I can't generate or get any sort of information on that until this first payment gets made and they get out of the cancel pending status. No, that's fine. That's fine. I was just wondering because I was sitting here and I had seen the email come through on their end. Right, yeah. I guess because I just included them in that because you had mentioned. That to them. The payment. Yeah, yeah. Oh no, it's fine. It's fine. Okay, thank you. I'll let you all message you back. Okay, I'm ahead of lunch and then I'll be back here in a little while. Okay, and we can go from there. Okay, sounds good. Thank you. Thanks. Okay.
