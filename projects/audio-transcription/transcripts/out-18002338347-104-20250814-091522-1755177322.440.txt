Thank you for calling Chubb Agribusiness. If you know the extension of the person you are trying to reach, you may dial it at any time. For our policy billing department, press two. For our claim. Chubb Agribusiness. This is Pat. Hey Pat, it's Brian at Alliance Insurance Services. How are you? Good, how are you? Doing well, thank you. I am trying to log in and pull my commission statement for the month, but neither one of my logins are working, and when I try to reset the password, it still won't let me do anything. Oh, okay, okay. Let's see, what's one of the logins that you are trying to use? Should well the one I typically log in with is Chris Cook. Okay, and it's Cook just CEO. Okay. Yes, CEO. Okay, you got it. Okay, all right, just a moment. Let me check on that. Okay, let's see, and then what's the other login that you were trying to? Yep, the other one is B Leftwich, which is L E S T W I C H. Okay, all right. Let me check that one. Okay. Okay, let's see. Looks like I need to. I'll have to check with our agency support unit to see if they can reactivate one of those profiles. Does it matter to you which ones? Should I have them just reactivate the Chris Cook one? Yeah, either way is fine. Okay, all right. Just a second here. Okay. Okay, so if if they can get that reactivated, then what will happen is it's going to send an email to Christopher at myallianceinsurance dot com. And they'll have a the email contain like a password reset link. So let me. Well, okay, so in that case, he's out of the office today and tomorrow, so can we reactivate the B Leftwich one because that'll go to my email. Should go to Brian at myallianceinsurance dot com. Oh, okay, yeah, we'll do that one instead. Let me connect with him really quick, just a moment. Okay, thank you. Okay, Brian, are you still there? Yes, sir. All right, so they went ahead and reactivated that profile for B Leftwich. And so there should be an email that arrives shortly with like a password reset link. Okay. And as soon as that password resets, you should be able to get into the into the account then. Okay, perfect. I don't have that email yet, but I assume it will. Yeah, sometimes it takes a few minutes for it to come through. So. Okay, no problem. Thank you so much for your help. Yeah, you bet. If you still can't get in, just give us a call back and so that we can investigate that further. Okay, I will. Thank you so much. Yep, have a good day. You too. Take care.
