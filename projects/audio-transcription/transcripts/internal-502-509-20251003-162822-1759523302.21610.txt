Look for the audio input in your computer. Input, not output. Like in my settings. Yeah, like, well, in my computer, it shows that there is a tray at the bottom, and it has the internet, the battery, and a speaker. Oh, okay, I see what you're saying. So on the speaker part. Yeah, it's turned all the way up on the speaker. Okay, but it has to be to your headset, not to the computer or to anything else. Oh, I know what you're saying. Okay, so. Can you hear me now? Oh, let me see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. I can hear you. I've been here able to hear you.
