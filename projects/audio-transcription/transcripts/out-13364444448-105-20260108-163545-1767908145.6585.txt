Thank you for calling Heco Construction. Your call is being transferred. This is Melissa. Can I help you? Hey, Mister Isrid, how you doing? Hey Rick, I don't, I don't even know how to. You sent that last email and I'm sitting here. I've been scratching my head since they told me to get it. Yeah. And I thought, I guess Rick is he's going to scratch his head too. I can't explain it to you. I mean, I guess I just don't understand if they want to see that. I mean, somehow that exact bond, just a different date on it. I mean, that's that's a whole other original document. You know what I mean? I mean, I can't really change the bond that we stamped and sealed without just withdrawing it and issuing a new one, right? Well, I didn't know if you could go in there and just change the date and keep everything else the same. Yeah, let's see. Let me let me. I don't I don't understand either because. Let me just find that document. That let's see here I got to find out that was a that was the Red Street Tunnel. Yes, this has been the craziest I have ever seen. Um, I just I can't explain to you. Well, we'll figure out. I mean, this is a new one. This is a new one for me. I'll be honestly, I'm I don't I don't have words for it. Well, I'm going. I'm not the only one that scratched my head. No, when it comes to that, I'm sitting here going, hmm. What are we doing here? Let me look at this draft. I just want what I'm trying to do, Missy, is pull my copy of document I have. And it's just you can get and just yeah and just see if it'll let me manipulate here in the next you know 10 minutes because otherwise I'm going to have to. You know, scratch, but let me just see. Hold on. No, this is. Oh no, that was that was. Um. Now that bond you sent me was a Liberty Mutual bond, and I know now I'm getting confused because the document I've got attached here. Is is a Cincinnati bond? And didn't and didn't and we we redid that right? I mean, there was a second request for bid bond on that. Yes, we had to redid it because the first bid bond that we had attached was not the correct form that they wanted. So we redid it and we've done it on the form that they wanted. We hit it on that old style form and we redid that because because I was having such trouble getting Liberty Mutual to approve that old style bond form. And Cincinnati didn't care. He said, "We don't care what form we use for a bid bond, and that's why we used the Cincinnati bid bond." And because it was just I can get it done. Yeah, I know. And then and then. So and what we're so now what we're doing is looking at. We're looking at totally different bond. I mean, you I mean they're. Oh boy. It's look it's. Only thing I can say is that is there no way just to change the date on that. Let me let's see. Let me just download the one you sent me. I'm concerned about if I if I if I use this one here that we really. Yeah, it's going to look like this copy that you sent me. These copies of those red seals showing up there. You know what I mean? And I can't see. It's like it's right here. If we can change the date on that, then we can just send it to him back the way that it is. All right. Let me do this right. So what I I don't have a real fancy PDF editing tool. You know my my Brian left who does here. I've seen him be able to take some of these PDFs like this, like you're sending me and and go in there and take away the seventh day of October 2025, put the date in. Because it sounds like what we need to try to do right. Well, I would say that would be perfect and great and wonderful and glorious. That way it gets it to them as fast as humanly possible. All right. Well, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to send him an email right now. I'm not in my office and I know and he's he's working from home busy too. So let me I'm going to send him this email. I'm going I'm going to copy on it just so you know. Get you in loop here and I'm going to just I'm going to need to call him and see
