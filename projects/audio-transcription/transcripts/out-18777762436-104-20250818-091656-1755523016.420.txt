How can I help you today? Do you have the policy for Buck Out Tree Service? I think so. Yeah, I said I thought I said blackout, but yeah, Buck Out Inc. Tree Service and landscaping yet. Yeah, you got it. Looks like you guys, based on what I read on the deck page, pulled. I guess you guys have a US DOT number. Doesn't look like it's authorized. It's, but it looks like it changed the premium by six hundred and sixty dollars, and I'm just trying to. Get an understanding of what changed on the policy. Just adding the DOT number. I mean, I can reach out and check with somebody, but anytime there's any sort of DOT, it has to be on the policy, so it's a rating factor. But I can I can reach out and check for you. Give me just a second, but they're gonna just tell me it's the DOT number. But I can check for you real quick if you want me to. So just by adding a DOT number, it increases the premium. Is there some kind of result for Progressive on that? It's based off of their DOT history too, so I don't know how. Yeah, he's got their. He's got zero zero percent. Where he just he just he doesn't have any vehicle or driver inspection, so that's sort of why I called because I thought well if there's nothing there, I don't understand what. Increased the premium. Yeah, I can I can look for you. Give me just a second. Okay, right back. Okay, all right. Thank you, Tom. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright.
