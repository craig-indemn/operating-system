Hello. Hi Ashley, it's Gloria. According to my lines, sure. It's how you doing today? Hey Gloria, I'm good. I'm sorry, I got your voicemail right after I called you back, so I think I understand completely why we got that check. Okay, all right. I was just calling back to make sure that everything I left on your the voicemail made sense and why you got the refund. It did, it did. Thank you so much for calling me back. I appreciate it. You're welcome, ma'am. Anything else I can help you with? No ma'am, that's it. You have a great day. All right, thank you so much. Have a wonderful day. You too. Bye bye. Yeah, bye bye.
