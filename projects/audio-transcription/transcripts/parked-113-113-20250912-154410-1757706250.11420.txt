Todd, are you still there? Hi, hello. Yes, it's me, Todd. Is it scary? It is. Can I help you? Okay, perfect. Yes, I'm glad I caught you because I was hoping to get a hold of you before it's you know due. And today's Friday, I know the weekend you're not available and it's close to the end of the day. So anyways, my I want to make sure I got this taken care of before my account lapses. I've got these documents here. And they say end of Liberty Insurance coverage. And then pay fifty dollars. I don't understand what I need to do here. Did that come from the DMV? Or did it come from the company? DMV. Yes. The motor vehicles. Okay. Yeah, it says from NCDMV. Okay, can can I put you on hold just a minute so I can pull everything up and look at it? Okay, sure. Sure. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Um, I don't have any active policies for you. I'm showing that the Progressive auto policy canceled on July the second. Does that correspond with the with the letter that you received? Hello. Let me see. I'm checking my letter right now. Okay. I'm just reading over it to see. Um, I don't think it. I don't think it says July the second specifically, but it says. Um, a lot of other stuff. I don't know. Let's see here. But it says, yeah, account or sorry, not account. I mean to say. Control number, um, one seven nine. Oh, I'm sorry. Let me start over: one, seven, nine, six, one, nine, seven, three, two. And we'll see if I can get the policy. Policy. It's in the in Stok County. That helps. Yeah. Yeah, I'm in the Progressive site now. And it's showing that the policy canceled. On seven two of this year. And that is beyond a date that we could reinstate it for you. The only other alternative we have is to try to requote it. And start the policy new, but that's not going to it's not going to help you with that letter that you received because that is a lapse notice. From the Department of Motor Vehicles, anytime a policy cancels, the companies notify the the DMV. And then they send out those letters. So regardless of whether we redo it for you or not, then that penalty is probably going to have to be paid. I did cancel that, but I got insurance with a different company. So I have two different account numbers. Okay. That who did you get the other policy with? Oh, sorry, excuse the interpreter. Same company is also with Progressive. But I closed out that account and opened a new account. New account number. Same Progressive company. Did you? Where did you purchase that second policy from? From Progressive. I mean, but the agency that you use to place that second policy because we don't have that second policy, so you must not have purchased it through us. Online. Um, I can give you the account number for that. I just have it in my phone. Do you mind holding while I get it out of my phone? Yeah, you can do that, but I'm not going to be able to access it if you went through their online service to get it. You're going to have to call Progressive Direct. And get them to to file that document for you that the state is asking for. And they should be able to do that for you. So when when you make an online purchase, then we we don't we're not involved in that at all and we don't have access to any of your policy documentation. I can give you that number to call if you'd like. Yes, please do. Yeah. I will. Yes, ma'am. See. Find it here. Okay, it's eight hundred. Eight seven six. Five five eight one. And when you speak to them, you give them your most recent policy number and tell them that you got that letter from the motor vehicle department. And they will file the paperwork for you. Okay, hold on one second. I'm just copying that down from the interpreter. Okay. Sure. Okay, I've got that phone number down. Um, and I do have the second account number ready. Do you want it? Nine nine nine nine. Zero four eight two six. Okay, now that number is the number that you need to give to them when you call. Because we can't we can't do any we can't do any transactions with that number since you contacted them direct they won't talk to us. But when you call, that's the number you want to give them for your reference number. Oh, I learned something new. Okay, thank you, thank you.
