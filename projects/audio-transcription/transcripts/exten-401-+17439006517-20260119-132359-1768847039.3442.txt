Hello, this is Heather. Hey, this is Dylan. I just called a few minutes ago. Yeah. Um, so I'm on the canopy connect and I've added nine and my wife's name on the drivers. But when I go hit when I go to hit done, it just sends me to YouTube blink and I don't know what to do after that. That's it. That's it. Let me take it. Yeah, I know it's a little quirky at the end, but if you've got YouTube that sends you there, let me just. Yep, I have received it. I got it. Did you do it a couple times? I think so because I did nothing at all. I got it. I should have told you that. Like it's yeah, it's a little weird at the end. I don't know why it's it's like our commercial on YouTube, but. Um. Yeah, my my apologies for not giving a heads up. Once you get to YouTube, you know you've done it. So you're good. Okay. Thank you. Thanks for that. Absolutely. Bye.
