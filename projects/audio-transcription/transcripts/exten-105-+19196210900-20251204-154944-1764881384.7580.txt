Ah, this is Rick. Hey Rick, this is Kate Patel. How are you? Good, Kate. Good, how are you this afternoon? I'm doing okay. I have what they call the post thanks living. What do you call it? Yeah, I think I'm still recovering from my food coma from last week too. And we're going to go into another food coma in a couple weeks. I know it starts over in a couple of years. Yeah, hopefully I'll still get in my pants on January 1st. Right, right. Um, thank you for helping me out with this. This has been a whole saga. Yeah, yeah, I think it sort of surprised you that you ended up needing it. Is the way I read it. They were told you know they originally said no, you don't need it, and then it turns out you did it the last minute. Yeah, and I was like, "What? Because we've approved your permit. We're just waiting on the certificate of insurance." I was like, "Oh, you're awesome." Exactly. You specifically saying because it doesn't reach the forty thousand, I don't need it. Yeah, crazy, but bureaucracy. But at any rate, well, we can solve it. I wish it was you know a little less expensive to do it, but it's just sort of what it is with these minimum premium policies. I'm afraid, but um, but we can get it done. They've approved it, and once we make this payment, probably not tomorrow. I'll know the carrier. So what? Just to give you what happens here. The rate bureau is a state agency, and we have to send these types of applications through their portal, and then they will assign the policy to us to one of about three or four or five carriers that participate in this state program. So I and once I know that I can give you the certificate of insurance. So shouldn't take me much longer than a day. Oh yeah, that's fine. That's fine. I've got the numbers that you need. So whenever. All right, so yeah, go ahead with the routing number, please. Okay, it's zero five three. Yep. One hundred. Three hundred. And. Count number. Go ahead. Zero zero eight. Yep. One three zero. Okay. One zero six. Okay. Three nine five, and I'll go over that one more time. The routing number is zero five three one hundred three hundred. Okay. The account number is zero zero eight. One three zero one zero six three nine five, and that is Edison King LLC. Okay, good. Yeah, I was going to ask you, was that a business account? Which that's the way it's doing it. So that's a business account, and I'm going to say that. They'll send me the receipt and I'll send it to you. So that pops up as first citizens' banking trust. Does that sound right? Yep, that's right. Good deal. So let me continue here. All right, sixteen twenty two was the amount. I'm going to accept that. And I will print well. They're going to email it. So let's confirm that. Okay, that's been submitted and accepted. Okay, so I'm going to send you a receipt here in just a couple seconds when I can when I can download it. And like I say, probably probably tomorrow at some point they will send me an email and saying okay we've assigned it to Travelers Insurance or whatever it is. And once I once I have that, then the magic certificate of insurance can be generated. Right now, I just don't know what company to put on it. Okay. But but I'll know pretty quickly and I'll get that to you. Do you do I need to put that certificate to anyone's name or just into a blank a blank certificate? Is the city of is it the city of Garner? They say that at all. So I'm going to say just blank. I think they just need to know I have something. They just yeah that's very common. So typically what we'll do is it'll just say at the bottom of it it'll have Edison King it'll have details but at the bottom it'll just say for information only. And if and if somebody there changes their mind, oh gosh, our name needs to be on it. Well, you just let me know it's an easy fix. But I wouldn't know what to put on it apparently right now. So yeah, I don't I don't either because it could be some different from what I think. Yeah, and it probably would be if we guessed at it. So just hang tight. I appreciate it. We've got I see all these confirmations flowing in here. Let's see what this tells me. They may have assigned that. Hold on. Let's see why download it.
