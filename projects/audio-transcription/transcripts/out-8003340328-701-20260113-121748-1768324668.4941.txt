Thank you for calling Auto Owners Insurance. If you know your party's extension, you may dial it at any time. Wait while I transfer your call. Commercial Alliance, this is Ally. Hey there, Ally. This is Jeremy Palmer with Alliance Insurance Services. How are you doing? I'm doing well. How are you? I am doing very well. Thank you so much. I needed to ask a question in regards to the Handyman Class Code, if you will. Yeah. And to see if the incidental roofing repair replacement is that something that is acceptable in that space. Or is it discouraged in that space? Yeah, gosh, that's a good question. That Handyman Code is so generic, and that can make it tough sometimes. Let me check one thing. When you say incidental, do you have an idea of like how often, like percentage of what they do that would be. So out of their, their gross sales, they're projecting to be 150, 000. It'll be a new venture, but he's got 25 years experience. Start out on his own basically. And she said, she keeps the books for her husband who's doing this solar provider. That he might do two or three for the entire year, at most. Would be their projection. And like what kind of work are they doing on it? Well, like it would be for only for metal roofs. Okay. So if he did like if their primary business model that she was conveying to me at the time was basically renovations and or add-ons. So when they do like an add-on, obviously you might have a new part of roof that needs to be put on there. Onto the structure, she said, but he only does metal. So I'm guessing if metal is not what the current roof is, then someone else would be taking that over. Okay. Doing that. Yeah. Um. Did that answer? Did not just give you way too much. No, I think that's helpful. I just am trying to. Trying to check a couple things. Okay. That is helpful information. Give me one second. Sure. Um. Okay, so I mean, it looks like yes. I mean, we definitely from what I can see. One of the things that is like contemplated in that code would be like incidental patching of a roof. So you know, if they which it sounds like it's probably what they're doing is they're just doing like some roof repair on only metal roofs. Um and if they're doing as few as it sounds like they plan to a year, that would be that that would be within the scope of of that classification. Okay. Okay, and and that's what I wanted to be. You know, I didn't want to start putting in a quote, get excited about something and present to them, then find out, oh crap, I didn't do that code. Yeah, no, that code should work as long as it's you know as incidental as it sounds like they plan and then again patching of roofs, not any major roof repairs or replacements or anything like that. That would obviously be a horse of another color at that point, but understood. That's perfect. All right. Work on that from there then. Okay. Great. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good day. You too. Bye. Bye.
