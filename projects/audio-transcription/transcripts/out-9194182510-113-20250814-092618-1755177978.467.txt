Good morning, this is Jim. Hey Jim, this is Gary at Alliance Insurance. I got your message about the one auto policy. Just wanted to try to get a little detail of what we were doing here. Yeah, well, you know I've been with you guys for a long time and I appreciate all the service. And just look at my budget. I I got a quote from another provider and so I've decided to switch on the car. Okay, now on the on the policy that we're canceling, it it is not affiliated with the rest of your package. Is that correct? As I know, yes. Okay, and did did we even try to to put those vehicles on the other policy or not? I don't understand what you mean. Put it on the other policy. Well, and if you've got two policies, two auto policies which I'm showing here, um, and your home and the umbrella. We could have combined those two auto policies together. I don't, I don't have two auto policies. Yeah, hold on just a second here. Let me look. I only have one car. I am showing a separate auto. Let's see, the auto policy number for auto owners. And the umbrella and the homeowners you want to keep with us, right? I want to keep the umbrella and the homeowners. Okay, I've got one auto policy. Yeah, I've got that now. I'm sorry, I just mispoke. Okay. So leaving the umbrella and the homeowners alone. Correct. Okay, very good. Just wanted to clarify that. Okay. Yep, appreciate that. Very good. Thank you. All right, thank you, sir. Have a good day. You too. Bye bye. Bye bye.
