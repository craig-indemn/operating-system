All these people. Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hi Ashley, this is Maisie. I'm calling with Milestone Settlement. How are you? Hi, I'm good. How are you? I'm good. I know you spoke to Jennifer earlier when you called it. Yeah. So I was calling back. Are you guys able to accept the check and then have the difference sent out or did you want to send the check back to us and then have the full amount sent back? So we can I can actually post the well. I don't know if I have that option. Because we could we could just send I could just have them pay out the difference if you are able to accept the check. Right. Yeah, which would be easier. Right, right. Because then if you send it back to us, we have to wait. Then do a stop pay and then wait a day after that and then we have to recut it back to you guys and it may take another couple days for you guys to get. Um, it doesn't give me the option on the carrier side. What I can do is call them and see if they can take this and then I'll just let them know that y'all are issuing another check for the difference. Okay. Did you want my email address to send me an email confirmation if that was if they are okay with doing it that way? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that works. Okay. Um, and I can. Oh no, my email. Okay, let me know when you're ready. I'm ready. Okay, my first name is Maisie M A I S H A. Okay. At At Milestone Settlement dot com. Okay, M A I S H A at Milestone Settlement dot com. Correct. Perfect. I will. Well, Essen is um I hear from them. I will email you. Okay, awesome. Once it's confirmed, then I can go ahead and email our escrow team to send out the difference. Okay, sounds good.
