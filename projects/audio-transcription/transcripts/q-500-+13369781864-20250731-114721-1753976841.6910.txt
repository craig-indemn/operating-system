This is Jessica. Can I help you? Ah, yes. Um, I'm trying to find someone that can write like the North Carolina joint underwriting thing for like homeowners insurance. Do you guys do that? We write a homeowners insurance in North Carolina. It's um, I've had it before. It's it's like the cheapest homeowners insurance you can get if you can't get it anywhere else. I don't know if you're. Yeah, I think it's just like basically for like fire coverage. Yeah. Do you um? We don't we don't unless you have like your home with us and I'm not your. Okay, well I'm having. Yeah, I'm having problems with these insurance companies. If they see something they don't like, they won't write the policy. They won't write you a homeowners policy. So I've had this problem. Seeing that you don't have like, is there something you need to fix? Well, they don't like the roof, and I you know what I'm thinking. Well, the roof is fine. What what is uh? What is going on and I just don't get it. Um. So you know someone would have to come out and just look at the property and say, okay, you know maybe they don't do it. I'm I'm just running into some of this stuff that's just got me baffled. Um, I know there's some problems here, but I just I'm running into some dead ends. Yeah. You know I've I've been here for three years and I've been taking care of problems as I go. And so I don't know. I'm just reaching out to whoever I can to see if I can get. Uh, any kind of help you know with getting a. I've got a policy till August 10th. I went through progressive because I got a progressive on my auto insurance. And I thought, well, they I'll get better insurance than that minimum. With them, well, they come out and they don't like it. Yeah. So they they call me and told me, well, we're not going to write a policy. So anyway, I've got till the 10th of August to try to come up with a homeowners policy. Um. You know. So I didn't know if if um. If you guys would even be able to help, I know it would get me out of the woods if I could get the North Carolina joint underwriting policy wrote until I can get all this stuff fixed. You know. So someone would give me a a better policy. Yeah, yeah, unfortunately. So that's what I'm running into. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Unfortunately, we probably would be in the same boat with the other carriers as well because our companies are strict, especially the roof right now. Yeah, it's a little tough. So you don't do the North Carolina joint underwriting. No, no, we don't rate those. Okay, well, okay, well, that I appreciate your time anyway. Of course, you have a good day. All right, bye bye.
