So if you're hold, this is Cody Malpied. Hey Cody, it's Claudia. I know you're gonna think that I am crazy, but I swear that I am not. I I I swear I'm not crazy. I don't think. I had a conversation with Nate. Because you know I told him I was gonna own up that I made a mistake on. He's like, you didn't make a mistake. I'm like, okay, but I thought you all told me we couldn't do any more. Sole props. Sole proprietors. He goes, well I had a conversation with Christopher and Cody and I just said that we the pay the payroll to the number of employees needed to make sense. I thought that we kind of resolved the issue so that's. Okay, all right. I'm like, I guess maybe I was left out of that conversation. You know. Yes, Nate and and our territory rep and Christopher and myself we met and had a fun conversation. How well? And okay. I think I thought we kind of resolved the situation on that. You know, obviously, just making sure that we're putting correct payroll and scheduling people included excluded correctly and all that sort of stuff. Well, they forgot to tell the person. Well, shit, maybe I was confused. No, no, you ain't confused. Maybe. You just got left out a little bit, maybe. Yeah, I just got excluded. So he's like, no, no, no. We resolved. I'm like, okay. I guess the person that needed to know didn't know. So I'm calling to tell you disregard whatever I said because we didn't make a mistake. Okay, good. Well, good. I'm glad that that is the consensus around there. So. Okay, well the last person to know I now know. Well, hold on to that. Hey, that is not your fault. Yeah, that is not your fault. Communication is key, isn't it? Ah, yeah. You know, especially if you change the directive and then change it back, then change it back and got to tell the one person that might need to know this. The correct conversation, but we good. Just wanted to clarify. You take care. Bye Cody. You too.
