Hello. Hey, I am Jelica. This is Brandy with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Um. So I know that you're um. I didn't forget about you on your home policy. I know that you're. Okay. And his mom owns the property. But since you send me that declarations page over, I noticed that the renewal date it wasn't until August. So I wanted to wait a little bit until we got closer to see you know what the what your renewal looks like and what I will be able to provide you so that way you have some kind of comparison. Um to it. Um. So the other thing that I wanted to ask was I couldn't remember if I asked you. Do you know the roof year on this home? How old the roof? Oh. Yeah, I believe it's 2006. Let me see. Um, I can find that information for you. I I'm confused. It's 2006 or 2016. But it's something with six. Okay, I want to say that it's probably 2016. Um because. Um. Y'all. Let's see. Did y'all buy that home in 2022? Hmm. He bought the house. Yes, in August 2022. Yeah. Okay, okay. Because the pictures on Zillow because Zillow is still there and it looks almost really new. Um. It doesn't look like a 2006 roof, so that's why I wanted to ask to make sure that I put the right roof year. But I would figure that it's probably around 2016, but I wanted to double check with you. Okay. Awesome. So I should have. Um. So I should have a quote for you in the next couple of days for that home, on where we might be able to um. To put it and maybe possibly, bundle later on. Um. But I wanted to. Have you gotten a renewal for that yet or has he? No, we didn't have any renewals yet, and it's weird. I want to check his email because I'm fine. He doesn't pay attention. But I will go ahead and check the email today and maybe I can send you an email. Okay. Yeah, that's no problem. Um, because on the declarations page that you gave me it says 8:15. Um. So I I know that I would get a little bit closer. So you should have it 30 days prior. To just have it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we should have it. That's correct. I want to call then. Okay. All right. Well, yeah, I didn't realize. Yeah, today's 29. Yeah, we're getting a little close, but I wanted to let you know. I did not forget about you. I was waiting a little bit closer. Um. But I think I have um some competitive um rates for you on that home, especially if we start looking at moving um the auto to bundle. Um. You know, so I will I'll send that over to you probably by. Today, I would say Thursday. Um, I'm gonna send you an email of a quote for the home. Okay. Okay, that will be awesome. Um. Look, I just check it out and the house is building in 2006. I know it looks new and we try. Also, the picture is in Zillow. Now it's better because we do we did a lot of remodeling like the bathrooms and upgrades. But yeah, it's 2006. The roof is 2006. Hmm. But we did a roof. We did a roof in 2022. It's a brand new roof. Okay. Um. Do you still have proof of that? Like, do you have the? Yeah, like from the roofing company, like a receipt or an invoice or anything from the roofing company that you use. Yeah, probably we have that on the file. I will check it out and send it to you. Yeah, if you can send it to me because you'll definitely get a better rate with having a newer roof. Um. The companies. Yeah, the companies. Yeah, the companies will just want to um see proof of that. So yeah, definitely send that over. I will send you that and yeah because we got a new roof and new gutter. We have everything new. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, that sounds good. Just send that over to me and like I said, I will send you over a quote um no later than Thursday and then you know you guys talk it over and then just let me know if you guys want to move to us with that okay.
