Alliance Insurance Services Maria. Hey Maria Bill McClure how are you. I'm good Bill how are you doing. Good good um you got a minute. Yes sir. So um I'm assuming you don't know any more about the the question about if we're going to get charged if we cancel mid term. That like I told you what I spoke directly with the carrier underwriter and had them. Let me can you give me an exact amount of what they would owe if we canceled it effective today. They figured it up and what they did they took what you just paid in like I said on the 27th subtracted any subtracted out any unearned premium so there was still enough earned premium they said that you would get a refund. Okay. They did not know the exact amount of the short rate. Got you. They did not feel like you would have to owe anything. Okay. That's the best answer I can give you. Oh so well I mean that's fine. Yeah I just I just didn't know what that if I had to come out of pocket of any monies I didn't know I just want you know is it a dollar or a thousand dollars I mean I don't I mean I won't. I just want to know I'm a numbers guy I just want to know what what I'm getting into so here I got a couple questions on what you sent me over on the National General. Okay let me get that pulled up here real quick while you're asking while you're getting it. So um could you quote this. Um for each vehicle under property damage. It says a thousand thousand dollars actually can we go up to 250 on that. May get your quote up here I can tell you. Let's see what that cost is going to look like. Okay you're wanting to edit the coverage amounts on the vehicle. The property damage yes. Okay. And the second thing is I don't think we have an umbrella policy do we. No and that would be something we might want to look into. Okay can you check that for me as well. Yes. I just didn't want to throw anymore. No I want you know. No I understand you know I I think um. I just I didn't realize I didn't have an umbrella policy and then. I'm thinking now moving forward you know when we have when we're making these changes now and we're getting a nice savings possibly looking at some. Absolutely. Other coverage that we probably need to look at more closely. Absolutely we can definitely do that I will get on that. Okay. So let's quote you want to change this quote. The property damage which is a collision you want to increase that deductible to what. Um. I got my glasses I took my glasses off. So under vehicle level coverages under. Property damage. Can we look at moving that up to the next bracket I think which is 250. Now you're talking about the collision deductible which is um at. We have collision with a 250 deductible right now quoted and we have the comprehensive. Deductible at 100. Okay well so let me explain what I what I think I'm trying to ask you and I may be wrong. So if if we have a collision with another vehicle. In this day and age some of these vehicles now you know for for replacement or for total you know it could be over 100 thousand dollars. And my limit is 100 thousand dollars. I got you you said the liability portion of it the next bump up is actually 500 thousand. Oh it is liability yes sir. I see what you're saying now okay let me see what that would be. So I don't want to under insure myself if that incident occurs with an expensive vehicle. Correct. I understand that. Okay so to increase that I'm updating that calculation right now give me one second. Okay yeah I didn't know what the next level up was 50 or 500. It's 500. Okay so and that's also going to increase the insured motor's property damage for you as well because it has to match. Okay. The liability and that will bring the annual premium to 4193 and 85 cents. Forty okay let me go back up here. Forty one. Ninety three so it's going to go up 100 dollars. Yes sir. Okay yeah let's go ahead and do that. Absolutely. And are there any other tweaks you would recommend to this policy. Well let me ask you let's go back here one second. I think you mentioned about um. No I'm sorry go ahead. Hello. I'm here I'm just I'm looking at all the different coverages to see if there's anything. Neat I now you do not have towing I don't um know if that's you've got rental which you may may not need rental I mean I know you have four
