Think the whole thing was scary. Hey, you're in Bill Jones. Hey, Mr. Jones. I signed that thing the other day. I did miss it for a day or so. And I did do the what I thought I was supposed to do, but. Well, it did not come back to me. And normally, if it's if you clicked it correctly or did what you need to do, it comes back to me. And we we have not received that as yet. No, and you send again when? The day. Yesterday, I think. On the day before, maybe. Let me just double check here. What? It must be lost out there in that cloud somewhere. Yeah. Okay. Here's the I see. The link I need. I see I signed it. We're from from I can't remember lady's name. That. Please, Heather. Maybe. You document. Heather Johnson. I viewed the document. We'll do it again. Yeah, she did the document. That's correct. Let me try again. So it says signing complete. Oh man. Does it say anything about other than complete or send or finish or anything? No, well, what should I do? You think. Well, if if it's telling you that it was completed, it should come back to us. So let me just wait until Monday and see if it shows up. Okay. And if not, we'll make other arrangements. Alright, sounds good. Okay. Alright. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Bye bye. And bye bye.
