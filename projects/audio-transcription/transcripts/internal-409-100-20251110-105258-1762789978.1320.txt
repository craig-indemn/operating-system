Hello. Hey Corbin, how are you. Hey, hey, good. How are you. Good, not bad. Um, I had a question for you on the chatter you sent me. Which which one? I feel like I got a million over the weekend. Who. B Inc. Yeah, thanks for checking on that. Yeah, of course. So I called her. I got rounding account number. Um, she does want to be on autopay, so I did. Um, or I am in the process of getting the EFT. Over to her, but. Um, I was trying to make her payment online. But and I click policyholder pay, but it doesn't give me the option to put like a card or like. Her information, so I don't know what it's going to draft. So it's. So when you go in the Cincinnati. It looks like it's got two policies. I don't know if they're on one account number. I don't understand. I don't know their billing. I haven't looked into it. To be honest, but. I think it is for both because one of the policies is like ninety eight and the other one was like thirty one dollars or something like that. Oh, okay, good. That's good. That makes it easy. Um. So let's see. Asking me for a code. I can't get in. Six five nine seven two one. Yeah, I just didn't want to process it without knowing. Where it's going to draft. Where do we make a payment at? Let's see. Let me just put that policy number in. One ninety. Is that the one for one ninety seven? Ah, yeah, I think so. Or it should be two sixty with thirty four cents. Because I do not have permission, please contact customer support. Nice. Um. So your your question to me again. I am sorry. So I try to go in. Yeah, I am trying to make her payment, and it gives me the option agency EFT, agency mail or policyholder pay. I clicked on policyholder pay, but that's all it gives me. Like it doesn't give me an option to put her information in, and then it just says post payment to account. So you worried about. So if you click on that, what happens? So I am going to hit post payment to account. And then hopefully it'll give you an option to add one, add it. Okay, and then it just says. Um, a policy or policies contained will cancel soon due to non payment of premium. The full amount is required. Partial payment will not rescind the pending cancellation or amend the pay plan. Yes, I wish to continue or no. I don't wish. So making me pay the info. I think yeah. Is there any way you could contact the um. Billing department and see if you can. Put that on a. On a draft, she wanted a monthly, right. Yeah, monthly for the same. See if they'll see if they'll do that for you. I mean, if not then. She's got to pay all. Tell her put on a credit card or something. I don't know. Um, hopefully they'll. Is she not made a payment in a while? Is that why they're. Um. So the due date was on ten twenty one, and then they sent that to her on nine twenty nine. It's not very long. If they have to get approval or anything from underwriting. Sometimes they'll. They'll because the billing department really has no power. They'll just say. Well, you know those. You know just ask them or anything. You know. She's been wanting to get on billing. You know I would just say she's been wanting to get on billing, but we haven't figured out a way to do it. You know what. What we have to do to get her on a monthly or approve for a monthly. For monthly. Stub's underwriting might have to approve it. Okay. I don't know why they wouldn't. I mean, that's a safe. That's a safe payment plan. You know. Right. Yeah. So do I just call the. Um, just the Cincinnati bill representative. Yeah, I will just call their. Their department and ask. Okay. I wish I had the phone. I mean, look customer. Contact us. Agency billing. Agency.
