I'm an agent with Alliance Insurance Services in North Carolina. How are you doing, doctor? Good, how are you? Well, thank you. We had a question on a policy for a customer of mine. It is 801. 1349692. The customer's name is Clay Adams. Okay. And we added a vehicle for him to his auto, and I know I've got it set up as annual EFT and wanted to make sure that 49115 is that set to draft automatically or will I have to be manually input. Yeah, if you look at the big summary screen, you can see the due date. That's going to pull automatically on the due date. Okay, so it is going to pull it automatically for that due date. Yeah, if it's on if it's on EFT, yes. That's what I needed to see, sir. Thank you so very much. No problem. Anything else? None do it. Thank you. How we do? You too. Bye bye.
