Howard Hitchcock. Hey Howard, it's Heather. How's it going? It's going all right. How are you? I'm okay. Um, it's been on Monday. Um, so Cincinnati still is not, they're still not going to approve it. Cincinnati isn't still working with Penn, and you know they've approved it, but I was just trying to help with what all you sent. I compiled everything and one email sent it over, and the underwriter was Penn because I thought well maybe I know they've already approved it, but maybe it would help the premium, you know? Especially if we can get the three points, you know I know you said that would come later this week if we could get those three point three ways. But I'll say for like maybe we're open for Canoar. I don't want to I don't want to go the other way since they've already approved it. But the underwriter was Penn says that she was looking over everything and I'm just reading you what the email said that she just sent me said that the 25, 000 word and 29 dollars paid loss shows date date of loss as 121022 for Anderson. She didn't see anything with the date of loss shown as 11523, and then she's like, "Am I missing something? " What? I don't know. I mean, they pulled that for me, so I'm like, I'm only going by what I'm being told by State Farm, so. Okay, but the the the accident was filed against Jordan, there right? And that was on 11523. Hold on. Because she she she showed on 11523 was an accident. Yes, that she. She had on 115. Okay, and that was Jordan and the trap challenger, right? The leveraged challenger. Yep. And unfortunately, it's so old at this point now. But the the other insurance company was Geico. Okay. Do you recall Anderson and an accident? With the same amount. Same day. No. No twelve. No, they're saying December the 10th of 2022. December 10th, 2022. It was that the the Mustang that Drew was driving. It could have been. Do you remember how much that paid out? No, I don't. Okay. Hold on one second. I'm looking at it. 28, 337. 22 cents. Okay. Is what I. That was paid. That was paid from State Farm, right? That was paid from State Farm. Yeah, okay, and this one all right. So I'm not sure. I don't think this one was actually showing off my report. Okay. Well, when I looked at the loss, the loss report. When I looked at the loss report, and I'm trying to remember where I put it now, but the loss report seems to show the difference between for the challenger for what was subjugated versus what. The total was, I believe if I remember that correctly. I'm looking. Too many complicated things. It's a lot. It is a lot. Yeah, well, I mean, you're you're just the tip of the iceberg. You have no idea. I'm dealing with my son's identity has now been used through the IRS, which is blocking my my tax return. We are talking about selling a business that we own, which I'm trying to pull together and have like hours to get this done. And then there's this nonsense, which. Um. Increase ten. Your C bank. I'm looking for the where you sent me. USLI, did I know that? Please, that one email. And that's fine. One don't don't don't dig too deep. Um, I just you know if we can um because we've got the approval, um but if we can get a something that shows that those points. Are removed. I think that would help. With the premium. Well, I'm expecting that this week it's coming out of underwriting, so the the agent can't do that. Right, I understand that's what I'm dealing with now too, and I mean, it's yeah, and mostly Karen with Hannah is pretty responsive like she's emailing me now so. Um, but I I get it. I know how some of those can be because I waited like for a week before the others ever came back. I was like, "No, sorry, we can't do this." Um, so I understand. So, but yeah, I mean we're we're good to move forward with that one. Um. But they had approved it last week, but like I said, if we could get some kind of something to help with that premium, but you know they the points
