Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hey Brandi, this is Ellie Middleton. Melvin Ody is my dad, and we have our homeowners with you. And we had set up doing every three months, and I couldn't remember I hadn't gotten anything for the next payment. And I actually want to pay the whole thing. I have the funds to do that, so I want to check with you and see what the remainder of the year would be to pay that. If you have time, and if you don't, you can you can send it to me email tomorrow whenever you have time. Okay, and I remember your name, but what is your dad's name? Melvin Ody E U Yep, D U D Y. Yes, I talked to you back in July. Okay. Yeah. All right, so please change. So if you wanted to pay the rest of it in full, it would be one thousand two hundred and eighty five dollars and sixty eight cents. One thousand two hundred and eighty dollars. Eighty five. Eighty five. One two eight zero. Oh, okay, wait a minute. Wait. Okay. One two. Say that one more time. Let's just redo it. One two eight five, and sixty eight cents. Perfect. All right. I'm going to be doing that within the next because it's not due yet, is it? Like the next. You have until October eleventh. Okay, perfect. But I'm going to go ahead and get that paid because I was like, things changed up so that I could go ahead and do it, and I I'd rather just go ahead and so I'm going to pay it off, and I just want to make sure, and I appreciate your help. Yeah, no problem, Melvin. Have a good evening. You too. Thanks. Bye. Bye bye.
