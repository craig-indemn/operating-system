Good morning. Thanks for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Oh yeah, I was trying to get a money, but I'm just trying to get a claim started on. I hit a deer this morning. Okay, would you like him for me to chat with or tell him money? Well, he didn't answer, so I didn't leave a voicemail. Just send me to his voicemail and I'll leave a voicemail there. Okay, is it with a personal vehicle or is it a commercial vehicle? It's a company. Okay, all right, give me one second. Thank you.
