Good morning, thanks for calling. I hope you. Yes, ma'am. This is John Stanley. Have they closed the Montgomery office? Um, I don't think so. Ain't nobody here. Give me one second. Nope, our office is still open. Ain't nobody here. I come up here Friday. There wasn't nobody here. There ain't nobody here today. Some team members have gone to other offices, but that office is not closed. It's only closed on Friday due to the festival they're having up there. What was that? I'm sorry. Why not open today? I have no idea, sir. I have no control over the office. I don't know what's going on at other locations. Well, I go to Powell Mountain. They got one down there too. I know. Yeah, they do. Okay, all right. You have a good day. You as well. Thank you. Bye.
