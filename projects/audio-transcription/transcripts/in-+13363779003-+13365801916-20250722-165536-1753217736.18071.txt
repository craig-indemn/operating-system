Thank you so much for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, my name is Melissa Nelson, and I have a policy for you guys there. And I'm taking my daughter Friday to get her license, and she's already on my policy, but she's on with her learner's permit. So I didn't know if there's anything I needed to do differently. Or let you guys know. Yeah, we need to add her as a driver now. Give me one second. Let me get a one license key that can help me. Okay. One second. Okay.
