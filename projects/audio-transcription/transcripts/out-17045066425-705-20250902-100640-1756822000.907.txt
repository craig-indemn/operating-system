Hello, sir. Mister Jerry, how are you, sir? I'm good. Happy Tuesday. It was like a Monday. What's up? What's up too this morning? A little bit everything just getting my. Hold on, but I got shut some doors. All right. They like to go right outside my office door and turn the the damn. The okay, I'm with you now. Good morning, sir. Hey, my man. Good morning. Good to hear from you. Yes, sir. Okay, that's that. All right. So I just had my first question. I had one. I was kind of wanting to talk about a little bit, and I just kind of blotted off. But I did have the you know I paid the deductible on that Jeep when we did that crazy deal fixing it but. I can't remember what I was supposed to do to get my deductible back. Was that the one not at fault? Yeah, somebody else another party was at fault, right? Yeah, right. We get so so Amy Amy was in a wreck and then we we segregated it or whatever that word is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we we y'all paid to fix it or y'all did the auto owners did. Right. But I actually deductible I ended up paying the deductible. What was it? Five hundred. I think so. Okay. All right. I'll look at the claim and see if we have we have an a claim adjuster info in there. And my first thought, Jerry, would be, hey. Your adjuster needs to talk to their adjuster. Their carrier needs to reimburse you for that. Well, I mean, their carrier needs to pay for the whole damn deal, right? But that's your job. That's auto owners is going to get them to do that, right? Yeah, yeah. Auto owners typically what happens in that space when you segregate? Hey, we'll pay for it up front. We're going to turn around and sue the other party. Sue meaning you know file a claim and all that stuff. Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's where we are. That that's what how it usually goes. Let me matter of fact, let me just look and see. I'm right in front of my computer. Let me see if I got anything in here. All right, so that that can be easily addressed. Let's just see here. Mister Painter, there you go. Now he missed Easter claims. Yeah, you've been you've been a little bit on the quiet side. Let's make sure of thing. You must have been busy, sir. I said you've been a little bit on the quiet side. You must have been a little bit busy. Yes, I have been. All right. I don't see the adjuster info in here, but that's okay. Don't worry about that. I would probably have that information. Well, you will you will, but I can I can track it down. Let's see here. Amy was hitting the right rear. Blah blah blah. Claim number. Yeah, I got what I need right here. Claim number, policy number. I just don't have the adjuster number. No worries. We we have our in house claims rep. I'm going to run it through her anyway. We have a team member. What what's the other question? Or question. So I started reading. I was reading through the the commercial policy. Taylor Protection Commercial Policy. What was that last part you said? I'm sorry. I was reading. I got the the last month a couple weeks ago. Got the the policy business. It's the business Taylor you know the business personal deal. Yeah, yeah, the commercial package. Yeah. And let me. And honestly, just at some point, not today. But like to go through that and understand that a little bit better. What we're what the hell we're spending five thousand dollars on. Okay. Then there's all kind of coverages in here that that I don't know. You know, so this started out as a little bit of a business loss. And I honestly, you can't read. You know, I know it's got the the location. The building here, the building in St. Paul's on this thing, and it's just so much stuff. But like, what are we covering? You know what I mean. Yeah, yes, clear as mud, right? Yeah, no, it's not clear as mud. Yes, it's clear as it is clear as mud. Exactly. Yeah. So what that sounds like to me is. Let's see. This thing renews October the eighth. So we're just that four or five weeks out. What I'm thinking, Jerry, because you got a commercial auto and you got your property and liability as well wrapped up in it. What I'm thinking is. No, no, no
