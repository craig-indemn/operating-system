Ah, Dana. Dana, hey, this is Heather. Yes, Heather Scott with Alliance. How are you, hon? Doing fine. How are you? Doing good, good. I've got a couple things said. If I could get you just a second look at for me. Yeah. All right. Bear with me. I always forget to have the quote. The quote filled up. And I think I may have called about this one already. Okay. But just want to double check. Okay. It's gonna be the quote key is two one eight. Nine zero two six two three. And it's for Don Hensa. Yep, got it up. Okay, all right. And again, I think I might already called about this one for approval, but just want to double check. Oh, good morning. Okay. It's gonna be the quote key is two one eight. Nine zero two six two three. And it's for Don Hensa. Yep, got it up. Okay, all right. And again, I think I might already called about this one for approval, but just want to double check on it because I'm getting ready to issue these. I believe. Okay. It was two claims. It's actually one claim. But again, you may see notes on there. I can't remember I spoke to Jenny or. Okay. Yeah, and she documented it, but just just like I said, just for my peace of mind before I issue the policy. We're good with that. Yeah, it was actually one claim. Oh yes, yes. Okay. Okay. Yeah, let me get out of it. Oh wait, yeah, it says you're in there. Sorry. No, you're fine. I should be out now. Okay, perfect. Let me refresh. Let me refresh my page. Okay. Um. It says that you were and it's still. Oh, okay. I'll just let me log out. I'm gonna log out completely. Just I just exited. I know. It's so yeah, it's tricky. Yep, all right. Now try. Okay. All right. Um and you needed to look at the. Just want to make sure we're good on this. I think she. I think I want to say I spoke to Jenny, but I forgot to document it. Okay. We talked about these two claims, but they're actually one. Yeah. Oh, it's from the same date. Yeah. It is. I don't know why they did it like that, but. It's just one and everything has been repaired. He's got a new roof. All the necessary repairs were completed. We love that. Yeah, we love that. Yeah, if it's a brand new roof, if the roof is the roof year 2025 or 2024. I think I think it's 24. Okay, perfect. Yeah, we we like that. I know right. Yeah. That that looks fine to me for sure. I experience every time someone calls them to get a homeowner's quote. And it's like, what year's your roof? It's got to be within 10 years, right? Nowadays. Oh, I know. Ten years was not that long ago either. Scary. Okay, so we're good on that one. Well, and then the next question is: So I his auto. I was trying to put the whole package with you guys, but the auto is being seated. Oh no. So I don't think we can really do anything about that, right? So. Yeah. Is it for claims or do you why or? I think it was claims. I think it was and I think that was another one that it was combined. I think. But it's showing two different things. I'm not for sure, but anyway. I can still write the umbrella though. Like if I write the homeowners and the umbrella, the requirements for the umbrella. If I write it with the same National General, it has to be 500 right. 500. I. The umbrella specialize. Okay. But sorry about that. That's okay. But is there is there another quote? Yeah, if there is. Okay, you're fine. You're fine. Let's see.
