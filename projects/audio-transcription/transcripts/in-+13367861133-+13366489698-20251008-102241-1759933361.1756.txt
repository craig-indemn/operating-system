Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? I'm trying to reach Brandi. Okay, give me one second. Let me see if she's available. So it does look like she's on another call at the moment. Can I send you to her voicemail? Or I get you another agent that can help. No, just want to she just sent me a text so I'm just trying to respond back to her instead of going all the way around some bushes telling somebody else what she told me and then them you know. Oh. Um, yeah, if you could put me to the voicemail. Okay, one second.
