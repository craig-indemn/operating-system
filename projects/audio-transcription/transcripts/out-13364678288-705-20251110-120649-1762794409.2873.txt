Hey Joe. Hey Michael, how are you buddy. Hey, how are you. I'm good. Sounds like you are expecting my call. I was. Well, Abigail said, "Give you a call. Do you have a few minutes? " Yeah, sure. So she just sent over a few email attachments on this previous loss you all experienced back in July. Yes. But what she didn't send over was kind of a description or a detailed explanation of what happened. Can you walk me through that and this will likely Michael require you to send me an email as well but go ahead and kind of give it to me from start to finish. Yeah, so we had been reached out to via email to come look at a property over here in Dobson, North Carolina. And then typically once it hits my desk, we've got the form filled out with the address, phone number, email, and name. So I called to set up an appointment, spoke to the gentleman about going out to the property. Everything kind of sounded good to him so. Scheduled to go out there that afternoon. We conducted our measurement and at the time there was no one home so kind of assumed it was a. Um, like a real estate agent or something like that. So I looked up the property and sure enough it was listed and looking for a new roof. So that's something we typically deal with is is real estate agents kind of requesting a new roof and they're in the middle of trying to sell the house whatnot. So once we had our quote over, I emailed it over to him and just asked if they had any questions concerns on it. They said that they were good with the quote and it fit within the budget and that they accepted it so typically from that point I like to reach out just to establish the color. Also get things officially good within the book. So then I called and spoke to him again and we talked about color and getting things scheduled for July 8 of this year. And then I had him told him to shoot me an email just to that way for our records we could keep track of. Of everything and then he sent me an email said sounds all good, that to make a down payment with you first before you start the project let me know if you are okay with that thank you. And I had already set everything up and we were already doing it so we I just emailed him back like hey we don't require a down payment we typically complete the work and then we'll send the invoice via email. And kind of just explaining how our invoice works and stuff like that, and I never got a follow up. So then when we finally completed the work, I guess we had some guttering as part of the quote as well. The guys for the guttering are separate from the roof and so they kind of get out there till Saturday. And they were out there installing new black gutters, had to remove the white ones. And I guess the real homeowner, I I don't know what what why or whatnot but he showed up that Saturday. Saw our guys working and kind of got into it with them was confused why they were there and then saw the sign for our company gave Leo a call and just kind of. Came out aggressively and didn't want to trespass and whatever whatever so that's when we I tried to get back in touch with the original. Client who I'd spoken to and it said the the number was no longer in service and that was when I kind of realized it was. It was potentially a scam so we we filed a police report and I didn't want to deal with the the guy who was saying you know we were trespassing and being aggressive but. I did wonder eventually reaching out to him and explaining the situation and he kind of acted like he didn't know anything about it or whatnot so. That really really all we did was file the police report and then they looked into both both the email party and the. The agent listed on the properties and found that this person was down in Africa or something like that and that the current owner didn't have any any part of it. Okay, so thank you for that. So you guys were out laboring materials is that where the loss is coming in at. Yes. Okay. And forgive me, Mike. I'm not sure if the email or excuse me the physical address was on that. Email traffic that Abigail said a little bit ago, but when you get a chance it doesn't have to be right now but when you get a chance if you can today send me that descriptive email what you just said but do include the dates you you. Referenced as well as the actual property owner's name whoever that is. Yes, sure. Physical address, what work you all performed, where the loss occurred. The loss occurred in essentially sounds like free labor. Yeah and I'm trying to figure out you know if this if this individual you know was out of the country or whatever type of scam. Where did they
