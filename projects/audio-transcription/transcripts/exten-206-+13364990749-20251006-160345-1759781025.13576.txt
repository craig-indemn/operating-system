Hello, this is Jeff. Can I help you? Hey Jeff, this is Mark Spencer at Cyber Gear. Hey Mark, how are you man? I'm good. I want to see if I can get connected to your computer and look at fixing the scanner. What can I do to help? What is your login name? What do you log into the computer? That's good question. All right. Because I generally just type in my password. Click on the start button for me. Okay. Let me find that. That's not the power button. That's the. It's down beside the search window. It's the four little squares. Gotcha. Yep. Okay, that's what I'm in. All right. And it should have your like the name that you logged in as. Oh, sorry, Jeff. It's just got my full name, Jeff Edmonds. Okay. But there's probably. Let's see my email address. Do you would would that be it or is it? No, it's it's this is that should get me there. I just want to see if if I've got access to that. Yep. Got it right there. I just. All right. Okay, I'm back in. Yep, I was making sure it wasn't under something else, but it's Jeff Edmonds. Yep. Are you in? All right. I am. I think you're in. Yep. Yep. If I if I need to close some of this out, they help you. I can do that. Okay. Looks like the driver is the only thing installed. Do you know how this one is connected? If it's wireless or wired. Is it your printer or is it is it the office printer? It's an office printer. It's it's the one I use to print. In this common. Where is it? Where is it located? Well, it's. I'm in Mount Airy. Is that what you're asking? No. In in relation to you, where is it that your desk because it. It is right on your desk. I am five feet away from it. Okay. Can you look on the back of it and tell me if there's an Ethernet cable plugged into the back of it. Yep, hang on one second. Yes, there is. Okay. Okay. So what if you drop something in the scanner? Until it's scanned. I think I can find something to lay it around here. All right, I'm going to lay the phone down. Hang on one second here. Sure. Are you still there? Yes. I've got you on speaker in case it offers me prompt. Sorry, I'm going to click scan. To a folder to the PC. Now let's try to the PC and see if that works. It offers me. After I click on to PC, it offers me to file to OCR to image to email. To file. Okay. Now it offers. Desktop. Six. Yeah, yours. That's you. That's your computer name. All right. It says it's connecting to PC. All right. It stopped trying to connect and went back to the original screen. So I'm going to press scan again. All right. To PC or. To FTP or to file. To PC. Okay. And then to file. Yes. Okay. All right, I'm back to that same message as earlier: connecting to PC. It also says if scanning is unsuccessful, try changing the security function firewall and parentheses settings to allow this machine and the selected PC to communicate correctly. All right. All right, the printer is going back to the home screen. Okay, so I've turned that setting off. So. Try again. Now it. Yeah, try it again. Okay. Scan to PC to file. There we go. All right. So when you do that, it's going to show you here. Where the where the file is, it's in your Pictures Control Center and scan. It's going to give it a generic name like this, so you can right click and rename it. Right. Okay. But there it is, and it's a PDF form. Now let me ask you this: up until today, when a document was put in that way, it was it was sent to Stan's computer. Will he will he still have the ability to do that or? Can can that printer only send to one laptop? I don't know how he was scanning it, but we haven't changed it. So whatever he was doing, whatever he was doing, it'll it'll still do. So I think he was he was clicking file where I was clicking laptop and then file. So as long as we do it that order, you're saying it should. Whatever he was doing, we haven't changed. Okay. All right. Whatever he did yesterday will still work tomorrow. Yep. Okay. But I didn't set his up, so I don't
