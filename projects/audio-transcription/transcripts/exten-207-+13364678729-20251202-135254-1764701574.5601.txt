Sorry, hold. This is Cody and Hoppy. Hey Cody, this is Victor. Hey Victor, how are you? Good, I'm doing well. Sorry, I'm sorry. No, sorry, no, you kind of sorry. I was calling because that day I remember when you had told me about the website for the audit. I forgot to do it and. Oh oh, I know they were kind of they were going to they have something available I think for the for the total amount. So that's why I was calling so I could do it here. These days I'm off so I can. And this is for the Travelers Workers Comp policy. Yes. Okay. So are you needing their their number or what? What are you needing? The the website so I can do the audit. Um. Let me see here. This is Victor Santiago, right? Yes. Just making sure you're not my only one. Let's see. Okay. Did you need a start? Did you need a start? It's non compliant right now, so you probably need to reach out to them so they can open up the audit for you. Yeah. Let me just a second here. All right, so the website that you go to. Is www.travelers.com. Yeah. And. You may need to go to this one first, and do you have an online account set up with them or no? No, yeah, because they asked me for like an email for my user ID and I'll send my email. And they said nothing was existing. Okay. Yeah, if you go to. Www.travelers.com forward slash register forward slash biz. Register slash what? Yeah, so www.travelers.com forward slash register forward slash biz. B I Z. B I Z. You should be able to log in there. Make an account. And make an account, and then they also give another website of travelers.com forward slash audit. I'll email you this um this letter Victor because it gives you a phone number and an email and if you need like additional information or you're not sure what to do on something you can reach out to them and they can help you. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can send me that and then that way I can do it here because I'm off these days. Victor. And still Santiago Victor 77 at yahoo.com. You've been doing well. Yes, yes, I'm doing well. I know I'm off right now. Yeah, it's hard to do this with them. So what's your going on? Things slowing down now. No, no. Yeah, that's why like I've been busy. Like I honestly sometimes I totally forget because I'm barely home and I barely have time. Barely have time to do anything else, right? Yeah, but but I know since I'm off a few days, I know I can do it. And then so then I'll call him and maybe they can order it. Uh, they they can open the audit again. Yeah, since it's non compliant, you may need to just speak with them first, just to make sure that it's open for you to go in and complete. How would I say? Do I confirm that I need the the audit open? You have an you know a non compliant audit that you need need to complete and just see what they instruct you to do. More than likely, though, they'll just instruct you to go online and fill everything out. But you probably need an online account, so just check with them and they can they'll make it a lot easier for you than me just telling you random information about you know because every company is a little bit different with doing audits. Um, so with Travelers, I'm not as familiar with their processes once things get non compliant like this. So I would just reach out to them and just let them know that it's non compliant and you want to get it done and they can instruct you the best way to go about that. Okay. Okay. Yeah, and there's a phone number and email, and then obviously those websites that I gave you are on this sheet as well. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. Sure. No problem. I'm sending it over to you right now. Okay. Have a good one. Okay. Good too. Thanks. Bye.
