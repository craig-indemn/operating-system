Good morning, Alliance Insurance. Oh yes, ma'am. Um, can you please check for insurance for my new car, please. Okay, you want to verify if the vehicle has been added to your car. I mean, added to your policy. Yeah, I don't know how much it costs this time. So. This is a used vehicle. We just bought so. Okay, okay. Let me put you on hold for an agent. Okay, they can help you get that added. Alright.
