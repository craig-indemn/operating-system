Hello. Hi, this is JC calling back with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I am good JC. How are you? I was on the phone. Oh sorry. That's okay. Glad I called you. That. JT, I got my husband Gary here. We're riding up to the lake house. We wanted to go ahead and work out this thing about the builder's rent insurance. I have the November quote and I also have the July quote. And I noticed there was a price difference, but we understand that since we waited from July to now. Correct yes. But JC, I just wanted to make sure I didn't see on the quote exactly what it covers. At like in detail, we wanted to make sure that it covers any building material, anything like that. Go over that. Yeah, so I was talking to one of the commercial agents and they were kind of giving me a breakdown of the quote that I sent over to you and basically what they were stating was that the insulation floater. If you look at your quote, that is what's going to cover all the materials that are going to be going on to building the home. So before they're installed, that's what's covering it. Installation floater. Okay, I saw that on there, and that just covers all building material. So it's covering yes, the building materials. Did you have and I can I can have this conversation with him as well. But if you have any specific questions or is it just what is what is being covered. Well, I think my main question was just what that covers exactly. And my husband Gary's here with me. Gary, you have any questions? Could you explain the floater to me, please? Okay, so basically all the materials that are going to be used to build the home. Before they're installed, is what is covering the the insulation floater. That's what's covering it. Now whenever they're. Sorry, go ahead. Go ahead. No, you go ahead. Does that mean when they bring it on site and just set it, it covers it? Correct. Yes, before it's installed on the home. After it's installed on the home, it's the the building limit is what's going to cover the cover it then. Okay, so in case of something a fire or. Trees fall on it or storm tears it down. Does that cover the rebuild part back? So you so the rebuild part is the building limit that you have on your quote. It's a five hundred thousand. Okay. If anything were to happen to. Okay. To the structure. Before it's complete, completely built. Okay, does it matter about the square footage? I think I saw that it was thirty four hundred. I just barely. Are you saying like on the on the quote? Yes. I don't know if we had that on, but JC, I know you had sent us a text earlier about the square footage. Let me go in there. Let me go in there and double check. Yeah, let me go in there and check because I don't I don't remember right off the top of my head. I don't see it on the quote. I think earlier when you were working up the quote, you said about the square footage, but I don't see it written on the quote. Yeah, I think what it was. It was asking me about what the square footage was like in the application, but I am just going to go back in there and double check. Okay. Okay, I am not. I am not seeing it on here with the square footage. I am just curious if that was. I saw it one time. I didn't see that. Yeah. Right, JC. What is the deductible? Let me go back to the quote here. Let me make sure I am looking at the right quote here. So the deductible is twenty five hundred. Yeah. And JC, I noticed at the bottom of the quote it says start date. Now this was when we did this back in July, so now it could be the start date beginning today. So if you look over, it says it says start date and then it says offer expires and then it has proposal term. Yes, ma'am. So that's that's what changed from from when I went up there and updated it. The other one has start date seven eighteen twenty twenty five, but the proposal date is what we're looking at there. I did I did go in there and change the start date to today. Okay, all right. Now JC, can we just go ahead and put this on a card? Yes. So if I understand this right, the floater covers on site material, right? Correct. Okay, and then the other part will cover any physical damage that needs to be repaired or replaced or rebuilt. Should anything happen after the material is installed already? Yes. Okay, okay, all right. Good deal. I think that that should
