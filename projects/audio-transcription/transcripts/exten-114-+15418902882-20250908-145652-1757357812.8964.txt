Thank you for holding. This is JC. How may I help you? Oh, JC, it's Susan Toner. Thank you for getting back to me. I was calling to see what you came up with. No problem, Susan. How are you doing today? I'm in Idaho visiting my sister. All is well. Wonderful. I'm glad. I know. Wow. How's the weather? Gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. And there's no humidity, you know. So you're not sunny and. I will say the weather is good here today, so I can't complain about that. I was going to say you're not. It's been a pretty August. Was a really nice month, don't you think? Yeah, it was decent. Just the humidity is. Has just been overwhelming. Yes, and when you're out of it, you realize how bad it is. Exactly. Exactly. It's a treat for sure. So I've got it pulled up. It looks like when we went to requote it, everything is pulling up pulling up about the same with those state increases. We did not find anything that was more competitive compared to your rate. Okay. So we are looking at Progressive being the best. Offer right now. Okay, in the past, I mean, it has been fairly consistent for a while. I was with Progressive years ago, and as soon as you signed up at a really low price, they just kept bumping it, you know. Okay. And but that doesn't seem to have happened the last couple of times, but it's always worth a check. I think. Absolutely. Since I am traveling, is it possible that I can pay you with credit cards right now? Yeah, let me just take a look at your policy. We're going to pay in full. Yeah. Yeah, we. I think there's a discount for doing that, correct. Yeah, there is. It's one thousand fifty nine and forty seven cents. Right. Okay. So you want to. And it's due the first anyway, correct. It is yes. And since I'm just going to put on the credit card. Yeah, I do. Yeah, what's that card information? I am. Okay, it's four one zero zero. Three nine zero two. Two two six four. Two five two eight.
