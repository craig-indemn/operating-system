Thank you for patiently holding the Somali speaking. Oh hi, I'm Moni. This is Sharice Daniel with the Hartford Small Commercial. How you doing? Good. Doing good. It's a pleasure to meet you virtually, but looks like I'll be coming in in a couple of next month. To do one of your team meetings, so hopefully I'll get a chance to meet you in person. Are you out of the Winston office? Yeah, I'm based out of the Winston office, so yeah, I'll be there. Is that the same office that Christopher and Brian Leftwich are out of? Yes. Okay, great. Christopher kind of he kind of floats everywhere, but. Which you guys coming in? He'll make sure he'll be in attendance. Yeah, yeah, I was the one who appointed the agency what like seven eight years ago, and then when I think they merged with another agent, so I ended up losing you all to my counterpart who managed that agency, and then it's funny how now it's coming back to me so it all comes back full circle. Yeah, I kind of heard a little bit of that backstory there. Yeah, so hopefully it was always a good experience working with me, but nevertheless you're you're stuck with me now. Hey real quick. All right. Thank you. Got a quick question for you. Now this may have already been asked, but I just kind of need to satisfy my curiosity. I see you quoted a restaurant for or a construction for colds cooling. It looks like the BOP and the auto. Yes. How did we look on that? I was it was a bit out of range. We did end up writing that one. We wrote it with Westfield. Got it. Okay. Yeah, I believe we did the whole package there for around fourteen thousand altogether. So fourteen and the auto. Yep, whole package. Okay, one thing to keep in mind. I know the auto probably had to be submitted, but we do have significant credit. That you could have applied and we could have won that one for you. So. Okay. Yeah, I definitely consider that next time. I think I think I think my type of my type of when I'm going in, I'm usually not a heavy credit guy. I'm type of a guy that you know if we're not there on the basic rate. You know then I'm probably not going to ask for a bunch of credit. Now if we're just a little bit there, you know we're a thousand a couple thousand often. Yeah, you know I would definitely entertain credits, but you know it has to make sense for me. You know I don't really like giving a lot of credits on accounts. Yeah, okay, and I'll talk about that next month. Our philosophy is different. We just give you a premium and then we allow you to apply credit to customize it. Yeah, yeah, I understand that. I understand that. I just I just always know that that credit falls off. So I feel like if we go in without the credits and we're where we need to be, and then you know down the line we're not where we need to be, I feel like it's easier for me to ask you for credits if they already don't have it. You know. Yeah, no worries at all. They already got the basic rate and we just need we just need to be down a couple thousand. So a lot easier for you to go in there and give me some credit if they have none versus it was already credited twenty percent. I got you. No worries at all. And then last one is slice of Italy. It comes till September. We came in at about eleven five. How did we look? Yeah, that one was definitely another one was way out of range. Their expiring policy was only at four thousand. So that was way out of range. So we just shut that one all the way down. Who's the expiring with? The expiring is with auto owners. At four K. All right. No worries at all. Okay. Well, I appreciate your time. I don't have anything else. Anything on your desk? Anything I can help you with? Um. See real quick. Do you do new business and renewals? Yes, I do. I do work on both. Right now, working on pretty much kind of like a a building supplies, a building supplies type of for us. They do a lot more lumber. Than anything, I would say about seventy percent lumber, thirty percent. Another thirty percent would be the other building materials like paint, cinder blocks, bricks, things like that. How do you do it on the market? No, not good. We would stay away from yeah from lumber and anything like that. Currently, don't have an appetite for. Okay. Gotcha. Yeah. Another one I'm working on here. Would you guys have any appetite for a
