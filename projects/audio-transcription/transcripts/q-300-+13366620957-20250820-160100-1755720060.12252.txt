Thank you for holding. How can I help you? Hey, this is Putter Mindbird from Auto Owners Insurance. I'm a field adjuster with Auto Owners and I'm just handling a claim for one of our mutual insurers on an inland marine piece of jewelry. Um, I was going to see if she could drop that piece of jewelry off at y'all's office and I could maybe pick it up sometimes just just to kind of make it easier on the insured. Sure. Um, what's her name? It's Julieton Deloro. And how do you spell that last name? On Deloro. It's A N D A L O R. Okay, let me pull up this account here. And she had basically the claim was: is a dog ate her jewelry and chewed it up and broke it and um, basically unrepairable. So, but we just have to collect piece of jewelry before we issue the payment to her and instead of having her drive out to Greensboro, I think it would probably be easier for her to drop it off at Clemens and then I could come pick it up for y'all one day. Um, do you have her like a policy number or something? That name's not pulling up for me. Yeah, it's um five four four nine three four seven six dash zero zero. Got it. Okay, yeah, you should be just have her drop it off at the Clemens office and I will let them know that that's going to be happening and that you'll stop and pick it up. Okay, it might I might be able to get over there Friday. Um, it does it. I'll try to get there as soon as I can, but um, it'll either be okay. I'll swing by the office and pick it up. What time are y'all open till on Friday? Ah, till five o'clock. Okay, okay, perfect. And I didn't even I've been to the one in Winston, your office in Winston, but I haven't been to the one in Clemens. It's twenty two fifty five Louisville Clemens Road. Yes, that's correct. It's Sweet C. Sweet C. Okay. I will remember that. All right, thank you. Well, I guess she's got to drop it off first. I got to see when she's doing that. But thank you all for so much for letting her do that. That just makes it easier on her and us as well. Oh, no problem at all. I'll let him know you are going to stop in. Awesome. Thank you so much. You're welcome anytime. Take care. All right. You too. Bye bye.
