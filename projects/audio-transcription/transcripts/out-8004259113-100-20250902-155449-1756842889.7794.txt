Hi Jude, yeah, the policy number is four two zero one one seven zero zero eight seven four eight. Perfect, thank you. And who have the pleasure speaking with? My name is Ashley. Perfect. Are you the agent or? Someone helping. Yeah, we're the we're the agents. Agency. Yep. Okay. Insurance. All right, perfect. And what's the name insured property address? Twenty four thirty eight Autumn Mist Drive, Winston Salem, North Carolina. And what's the name insured there? James Dover. Perfect. Can you change it to the phone number or an email address there for the insured? No, not at this moment. Perfect. You call on regarding payment or something else. Yeah, I am regarding the payment. So I went to the carrier website and accidentally made the payment in full for one thousand two hundred and eighty three. Because we we only received one thousand one hundred and twenty one, so I don't know if maybe you could stop that payment and. We can reapply this amount that I have here. Yeah, sure, one moment. Oh, so you received for one thousand one twenty one. That what you said? Correct. Okay, that was last year renewal. This year is twelve eighty three. So yeah, so. So forced not to do a full payment, right? We would have to either do a two pay or four pay. Which has some minor fees associated with it. Would you prefer letting them know that the payment went up a little bit or? Yeah, so I actually did call them and leave a voicemail. But can we still place that stop payment on it? If it was done today and not too long ago, I should be able to delete it. Give me one moment. Yeah, it was done maybe twenty minutes ago. Okay, so in terms of the payment plan, the two pay or the four pay. The two pay would be two payment one four six eighty six, due by the twenty second. And then the next one for four fifty one due by three twenty one. Actually, let me look at the current term. Give me one moment. Current term. Yeah, so first one would be of the two pay would be due by September twenty second for seven eighty three. And then the second payment would be due by March twenty first twenty twenty six for five sixteen even. That's the two pay option. We have a four pay option too, but not sure. It's it's minor fees. There's a ten dollars setup fee for the two pay and then three dollar payment fee each time they pay. But the seven eighty three and the five sixteen already include those fees. So. Okay. With the pay, with the two pay would be. What do you what you think would be applicable or do you just want to call them back and have them pay the whole thing? I'm just going to get them to get them to reissue a whole new check. That way we're not having to do two separate payments. So yeah. I know it's a minor, but it would be sixteen dollars total additional on the two pay. Yeah, so I think at this point, it's just best for us to just wait. Okay. To see if I can contact them for the right amount. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So I went ahead and did that for you. The payment is deleted, so it's not going to process. And then once you're ready, make sure you do so. By the effective date of the renewal, which is nine twenty September twenty second. So prior to that, would be great. But it's okay. Yeah. But currently it's after okay. Okay, sounds good. Thank you. Any other questions? Uh no, that was it. Perfect. Thank you so much, Enjoy. Thanks for calling. Enjoy the rest of your day.
