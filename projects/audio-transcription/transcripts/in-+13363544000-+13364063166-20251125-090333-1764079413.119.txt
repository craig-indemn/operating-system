Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Yes, good morning. This is Jerry Mason. Would you look and see how many vehicles is insured on with National General? For me. I looked on. I looked. I looked on the app, and it just shows two vehicles. Okay. All right. Let me see. So it's the 2021 Ram 1500 and the 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe. That's it. Yes, because it looks like back in back last month on the 10th, we had removed the 2001 Chevy Corvette and removed the 1996 Mercedes. Who authorized that? I'm not sure. Let me see. Okay, we talked about putting insurance on those two cars, but we never got an app or anything. I would never drop insurance without having one in hand. Yeah. Who authorized that? I didn't authorize it. Now for $1, 500 for two cars, that's ridiculous too. Yeah. Seven hundred car, no way. I'm sorry, I'm not fascinated. I just I'm a little upset with this. Yeah, no, you're fine. I mean, I totally understand. Um, so let me see. Because this was on October 3rd, Cecilia had created a case and. Let's see. Now I got two vehicles without insurance, and they'll come and get my cash. I've never would do this. Oh, all right. I'm trying to see what she did. Because she's talking about. And I say, yeah. I think going any further. When you lost Patrick Moore, you lost the best agent you ever had. Me and him have a good relationship. Yeah, unfortunately, I I didn't get to meet him. Oh, yeah, almost two years. I've been here almost two years. Yes, I didn't get to meet him. Great guy. Yeah, so I've heard. Yeah. Um. Let me get you. I've had I've had insurance for that agency for a lot of years. Uh huh. Yeah, we appreciate it too. Um. So what we can do is I can send you over to the service team. That way, somebody can help you, especially if you didn't authorize the vehicles. Um, because that's very important. So give me one second.
