Your call has been forwarded to voicemail. The person you're trying to reach is not available. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up. Good morning, Daniel. This is Jamie Flippin here with Alliance Insurance. You and I spoke late last week and filled out that questionnaire for your homeowner's policy. So I sent it over to underwriting. The underwriter emailed me back this morning because apparently there is a some I think a shingle loose or something with the shed. They're going to make you sign an exclusion form on the shed. So I sent that to you for electronic signature. It should be in your email sitting there. It's called CongaSign, C O N G A. That is a electronic form signature software if you will. You should be able to open it up, click to sign it, and then it'll come back to me. I'll sign it. It'll then go in the file to the underwriter. And also, underwriting is requesting proof that you replaced the roof last year. So if you could track down the paid receipt or you know invoice whatever, whatever you have their paperwork was. Snap a picture of it and reply back to me. I've sent you a separate email for that. So you should have two emails in your inbox this morning just to track that paperwork down. If you have any issues with any of it, if you need to chat through questions or whatever, if you want to come in the office and sign all this and do all this in person, that's fine too. I just figured you know the electronic might be easier there. So I'm in office all week. Give me a call if you have questions: three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. The very office number. Again, this is Jamie here with Alliance Insurance. Thanks so much.
