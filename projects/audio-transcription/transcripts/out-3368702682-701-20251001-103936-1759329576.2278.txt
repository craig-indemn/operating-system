Hi there, Teresa. This is Jeremy at Alliance Insurance. I was going to follow up on the life insurance application process. It seems like they have notified me that they still haven't been able to get in touch with you to do the phone interview for yours. And Tim has still not signed where he did his phone interview, and that was emailed to him for a docu signature as well. They are going to close the case this Friday, I believe. If they haven't heard back on either case, so I just wanted to make you aware of that. Also, if you got any questions, please give me a call or let me know if I can help at three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. That's three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thank you so much. Talk to you soon.
