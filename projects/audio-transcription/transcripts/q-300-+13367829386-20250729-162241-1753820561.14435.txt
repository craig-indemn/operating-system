Thank you for holding this. Is Heather? How can I help you? Oh yes, I am a client of you guys, and I currently have a policy. And I need to see what my insurance would go to, and I'm in the process of purchasing a new car. Okay, and your name please. Shannon Brinson, B R I N T L E. Okay, and your address. Five one seven nine, Chamberlin Place, Apartment Two Zero Two, West Salem. Okay. All right, it looks like I currently have you listed with a 2015 Nissan Altima. That is correct. Okay, and we're just wanting a quote on a new vehicle. Uh yes, I've got two different ones. Um considering and this will be taken off. And then I'm looking at a 2025 Mazda CX5. So you're saying that you would be replacing this one. Yes. Okay. Twenty five. And there's no ride sharing such as driving for Uber or Lyft, right? No. Okay. You might have to repeat that one more time. I'm not sure I clearly understood that. Are you? Do you drive for Uber or Lyft? No, no, no, no, no, I do not. Okay, we just have to ask because it's so popular now. Right. Zero twelve hundred. I'm just going to match what you've currently got on here. Well, and I will be financing this car as well, so I'll have to have full coverage. Okay. And it looks like you currently do on the car that you have, so I'm just matching what's there. Okay. And you're trading in the Altima. Yes. Okay. And what is your name again? Heather. Heather. Okay, Heather. Do you any way that I can like deal with you specifically each time I need to talk to you guys? Yes, you um you can always ask first me specifically that is. Okay, I appreciate it. Do you have the VIN number on this car because it's not going to give me a lot of info without the VIN. Hang on, let me see. This one. I'm not sure if it's on. I'm kind of like shopping around. I'm not sure if the VIN number is on what they've given me. Zero. Okay. I do not see a VIN number. Actually, what would it start with? You know. Um, not necessarily. I mean, it can start with a letter or a number. Every I mean every making model is going to be different. Okay. All right, try this number right here. Ready? My daughter is going to call it out. I'm driving. Yeah, go ahead. J M three K F B C M X zero seven zero six three eight six. Okay, I'm going to repeat it back because I probably misunderstood one of those. So J as in Jack, M is in Mary, three is that K is in kite. Yes. F is in Frank. Yes. E is an elephant. B is in bat. B is in boy. Okay. And then C is in cat. Yes. Okay, M is in Mary, X is in X-ray. Is that S is in Sam or F is in Frank? S is in Sam. Okay, zero seven zero six three eight six. Yes. Okay. Yeah, that pulled. Okay. So it looks like if we added the Mazda CX5, it would actually your policy would go down thirteen dollars and sixty two cents. Really? Okay. Yeah, um, usually Nissans have a rep for being more expensive to replace parts on, so that's probably what that. Where that's stemming from. Okay. All right, so try um. Oh, I don't have the VIN number for this. Well, never mind. Um. Okay. All right, I'm good with that for now. I'm going to be looking at a Toyota Rav4. Do you know about how they run? I mean, like, roughly are they more than a Mazda? You think. I would say it's probably going to be around the same. So I mean, you're going to be in the same ballpark as what you've got now with the Nissan. So a decrease is always good too. Okay, yes, it is, and I appreciate it. And um, once I make a decision, I'm sure we'll be in touch with you and go from there. That sounds good. I'll save this um this quote. Usually they last, I think, around 30 days. Um. So if you do go this route, just let us know. Okay, perfect. And I will ask you, Heather. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you. Have a good one. You too. Bye bye. Bye.
