My name is Tabatha. Who am I speaking with today? Yes, this is on John Wayne with Alliance Insurance Services. How are you today? I am doing good. How are you doing today, Mister Wayne? Good, good. Yeah, it's been a while. Yeah, calling. We got an auto policy number twenty thirty two. Two four one seven zero six. All right. I do have that pulled up for Kong Sam. Correct. I the reason I am calling because there is a I mean the the calling about the two seventy two dollars violence. That for the one of the the incident that only apply to I believe to his son from a different policy but now it apply to him you know again so it's like you know one incident but apply to both you know policies. For the same because you know I think the father and the son has the same last name but but it's just different middle name so let me give you his son's policy. His son policy is also with National General as well. Okay, what's that policy number? It's twenty thirty two. Two three eight two nine eight. Okay, let's get that pulled up. So now from what I am showing, the incident that we're looking at is from February fourth of twenty twenty four. Is that correct? Yes, same incident, but I think since that because they they were living in the same household, I assumed. And their name is low. I mean it's just similar except the middle name. So the system you know probably just didn't you know recognize you know or didn't see that you know these are the two different drivers. So it is is apply to the to the son and then now it apply you know to the father policy. So I need you to review and see if we can remove the one for the father. So the policy number for his son that policy just did start this past November and it doesn't have any claims on it. But I did look at the clue report which is where this accident pulled in from. I am showing that the accident was when the insurance that it was under was nationwide. So if we can get something from nationwide showing that it was his son that was driving and not him. So something maybe saying Kong Heen Fam or something showing Kong Fam date of birth three twenty six eighty five. Okay. The driver. That would that would be what we would need to to clear that. Let me ask you this: Do we do we charge that incident to the son policy? If we did, then we shouldn't charge it to the father you know policy because. I mean we can get charged two people on the same incident twice. Yeah, because if you look at the the the incident, dead that was the same dead that we charged to both policies. Unless you know you if you didn't charge for the son, then yeah we need to prove that okay that was you know the son's you know accident and not the father. Well, well on the son we would also have to prove that it's his accident and not his father's as well. So we need to confirm which policy it needs to be charged to. Okay, the son the one that ended with eight two nine eight and we only charged the son you know for that accident. So if we did charge the son, then why do we charge the father again and we have to make him prove it? You know because. So it's been on his father's policy for longer, but just because it's on his son's policy doesn't mean that it's not his because they do have the same name and it pulled from the clue report. So what we need to confirm is is which one of them was driving at the time and we need a document showing which one was driving because they do have the same name. So we need something to confirm that it's for the son so that we know that we're charging it on the correct policy. Okay, yeah that that that makes him bug but but but but why the system charged two people for the same accident? That what I am trying to you know you know I mean you can charge to the to the father's policy. But then we need to take off you know that job from the son or vice versa. But but the incident was actually from the son you know and we only charged him you know for the incident. Right. So but what the system
