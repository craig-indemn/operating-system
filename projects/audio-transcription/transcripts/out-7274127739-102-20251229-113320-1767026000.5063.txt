Good morning, Marshall Lines Underwriting. This is Pedro of Frank Winston from Insurance. How can I help you? Hi, this is Glory. I'm calling from a life insurance policy dream day. Doing good and yourself. I'm doing great. Thank you for asking. So I have a situation. I issued a policy on twenty pad. Its policy number is SGM C nine zero one one four seven three two zero zero. Under Mark Wyatt. That's good. Okay, how can I assist on your general liability policy? Oh. So. Um, I was supposed to issue it with the other option, the clear blue option. So that we can have it matching with the workers compensation that's active in our system right now, but so. I was having a hard time to issue it, and then finally when I issue it, I realized I issued with the other option instead of picking the clear blue. So that we can have the S W N C policy number instead of S G M. Does it affect anything? Oh no, you're right. You have it right because the workers compensation right now is with Frank Winston. So you have S W N C right because it's under the Frank Winston policy paper for your workers comp, and then for GL it's FG. Because it's general liability. So this is also Frank Winston. So they're matching right now. You don't need. So they're matching. There's nothing. Okay, I was worried because this is my first time issuing a policy with Frank. Okay, I understand. Yeah, they're both they're both written with Frank. Just the general liability policy number will look different from the workers comp. Workers comp is FW for Frank and for general liability it's FG. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. So there's nothing for me to really be worried about. Yep, not at all. If you if you ever decide later, like for example, if you have a client who needs benchmark insurance company because that's the other paper for workers comp. The policy number will start with a TW. So that's the difference. Like you'll see P is in Tom W is in Walter. That's for benchmark and then for general liability. If you were to choose clear blue, then it shows as BG instead of FG. Okay. Okay, so and so right now it's it's fine how it is. Yeah, you you have all written with Winston with Frank. All right, perfect. Thank you so much. No worries. You take care and have a happy new year. You too. Alright, bye bye. Bye.
