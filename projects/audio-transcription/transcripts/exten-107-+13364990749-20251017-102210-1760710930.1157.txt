Hello. Hey Cecilia, it's Mark. Hey, Mike. So, um, not sure if what. I'm assuming this is something different than what I first thought when I read it because Kendall's already on the scan to email, on the copier. The one. What is it that? Print Salem. She's not able to print though. Yesterday we were, she was trying to print a document or. Oh okay. Document, but it wasn't pulling up as an option for her to choose printer so she can print. Okay, well I will take a look at that. I was thinking it was a scanning issue, so my mistake there. What what is her extension? Uh, one zero three. Yeah, one zero three. Okay. Is she available now? She should be. I'm not at the same office, but before I let you go, I can message you and ask her. Um, I have. Um, I need to know if you're able to get it into our email account as admin. And restore an email we deleted about 30 days ago. 30 days ago, probably not. Um. I want to see. Well, no, I'm thinking of like a, or is it a is it a an account that was deleted or an individual email. Ah, yeah, an account. The accounts are. We could restore within 30 days. Okay. What is the which account is it? It's Laura at my alliance insurance. Laura at my alliance insurance. Uh huh. Okay, uh, let me log in real quick and take a look at that, and then I'll call Kendall back. Okay, sounds good. All right, thanks. Thank you. Bye.
