Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Yes, Brandy. This is um, this is Alan. From seven one seven Walker Road. Can you hear me? Yeah, I was um trying to send you some pictures. The tree trimming guys are here right now, but the pictures is not going through. Um, I'm going to keep trying to send them, but I'm just making sure sometimes it says that and and it comes through on the other end. Is there a way for you to check that and see if you received anything or does that go somewhere else? Yeah, let me see. All right, and you are sending them to the seven eight six one one three three. Uh huh. Are you sending it by text? Yeah. Okay, and the number that you're texting is seven eight six one one three three. Let me make sure I was sending it from the text message you gave me. Whatever this I was sending it to whatever this number is. I can't see it while I'm on the phone with you right now. It's not letting me see that. I don't see that it's come through yet. Okay. Well, I'll keep trying, and then the other option is I got the pictures. Um, if for some reason it don't let it go through on my phone, um, would it be? Would it be okay for I guess for me to stop by the office and I guess somebody else can, um, screenshot from my phone and you know what I mean? I don't know what else to do if it doesn't let it go through. You know what I mean. Yeah, um, do you know do you use email on your phone? I do. Okay, yeah, I'll send you an email as well, and you can try to send them that way too. Okay, we'll try that first then. Okay, if you'll send that then I'll try that way. Okay. All right, I'll send you an email here in just a minute. All right, thank you. You're welcome. Have a good day. Bye bye. YouTube. Bye bye.
