Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hi, this is Nick Patillo. I was calling to update a couple things on my insurance, and then I was going to have you send me a form if you could too. Okay, is it for is it commercial or is it a personal policy? I have both. Okay, which one are you updating? I'm gonna update the auto, and then I just need a form from my commercial property. Or a declaration from my commercial property. Okay, so the the one you're the auto that you're updating is that commercial as well. Is that personal? No, that's that's personal. I'm sorry. Oh no, you're fine. Just one moment, and I will get an agent that can help. Thank you much. You're welcome.
