This is Heather. How can I help you? Hey, Heather. This is Amelia Slate with National General Insurance. I'm sorry, I'm having a call on my personal cell phone. We got a new phone system here at National General Wednesday. And I've got terrible problems, so I'm just having to do the best I can. But anyway, you said there's an insured that's going to be renting an Aston Martin. They're going to go high dollar. No, well that's what I said, and I was I didn't want to verify. I mean because you know usually it would transfer. But nothing on their policy is as high end as what they are requesting coverage for. So I wanted to verify. Before I said it would exact. I know, I know, and you know, and a lot of people do it and they'll do it for a day, but who exactly is it a name insured or who is it? Mohammed Tarek. Is he? Where is he going to be operating this vehicle at in the United States? To to my knowledge, yes. So the rental company is who called me. I have not contacted the insured because I didn't even know if this was going to extend. But it is a Aston Martin DB11. She didn't give me a year, but I mean these run well into six figures for coverage. You know they do. Is this and I'm curious? Is this placed out of Florida? Any chance? I am. I'm not sure. They're usually one of these high end cars. There's one out of well, it's probably multiple, but there's one I hear from a lot out of Florida, Miami, Florida, and another one out of Charlotte. But yes, technically speaking, believe it or not, yes, coverages will transfer. Okay. Is there a limit on what they would pay out? No, no. It would be actual cash value. Well, I don't know about. I mean, it would be based on what the you know. Yes, if it were total loss, it'd be the value of the car. That's right. So man, he's got a lot of drivers, don't he? Yeah, I mean, I think half of them are listed with other insurance. So. Okay, got you. Yeah, um, but yeah, there are a lot on there. Now let me say this. First of all, has he? I mean, you just said the rental company has called you. Yeah. Did they say? Did they indicate? Of course, they're not going to care. But whether this is for personal use or how many people are going to be driving this thing. They just gave his name and said that he would be the one operating. Okay, well I'm going to put it this way: technically speaking, the coverages would transfer to that vehicle as long as it's operated in a policy covered territory, whether which would be United States in its possessions, Puerto Rico or Canada. And it would the coverages would transfer for their operation if it's just like a temporary thing. It's not going to be an ongoing thing, but you know, let's say he takes it out for a hot ride one day, whatever. And a lot of times it's just for a day or so. Sometimes they'll be have to be careful. Sometimes they actually rent these things to race them on professional racetracks, and I hope that's not what he's doing. So all that said. So racing would not be covered. That's right. That's right, and not even not on these racetracks. Nope. Okay. And like I say, a lot of people are doing that. That's the kind of one that's becoming thing, especially for older people anymore. But anyway. So if he's going to drive it for pleasure, the coverages would transfer to him. And technically speaking, if his spouse and or children live in the household, thereby qualifying as an insured in the policy, the coverages would transfer to them too. Okay. However, that's a big risk to just leave that open. I would just simply put that it's to him. And and that is the only driver that would be covered. Yeah, and like I say, technically speaking though it goes broader than that. But you know, we start talking these fifty and some bucks and these type things. It's a big big thing. A lot of carriers have gotten to where they won't cover these things, but we're not there yet. Okay, all right. Well, I didn't know if that was on like the ineligible list or you know what the case may be, but if it extends, I'll just make sure. And I'm on a recorded line, so when I call them back, I mean I. I can cover myself as far as that goes. Yeah. And you know, and they have nice vehicles
