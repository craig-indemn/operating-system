What about the trip? That's just five minutes. Hey Heather. Listen, you hear me? This is. Hi, this is Heather. Yes, is this the one? Yes, uh huh. Okay, hi. Um, so did you get my voicemail? Or did you see? I saw. Yeah, something happened. Yeah, something about the water claim or something about. The water claim. Totally forgot about that when I was speaking to you this morning. Um, so that's another thing. Like since he, I think they're good with the pool, but it's the now it's a water claim. So remind me what happened. Was it a defect? Manufacturer and defect or something. Yeah, it was. It was from the water from the HVAC. Um, had a defect. You know, with the way it was made, I guess it was leaking water from the condensation line or condensing the water was coming out of it and just got under the you know just everywhere on the floors. Um, but that was over three years ago. Yeah, I know they go back five now. Okay, okay, why? Okay, I know. Yeah. So it was now it was a water leak and it was um the defect from the HVAC and just got water everywhere basically that's it everything else. And then obviously and then there was nothing else to it besides that. But was it um? Did you end up having to file against your insurance or did you? I'm thinking there's something. Did they mediate? Yeah, I filed. Yeah, I filed it with the insurance. It gave them the information from the HVAC company, the manufacturer who said that. Um, that they were responsible. I guess because they fixed the unit and everything. As a you know we didn't have to pay anything to fix the unit, they did it all. So they kind of like assumed liability that deal. So basically, Farm Bureau was supposed to go get their money back from that. You know. It was a subrogation process. Right. Do you know if they ever did? Did they get off? I don't know. They they never told me anything about it. Um. I gave them all the information and all the email and all the communication that I got, and I never heard anything back from them. Okay. Okay, hon. All right, all right. That's that's all I needed though. I just I knew I was trying to trigger my mind but it was like I just said one okay. It really hasn't but it seems like it has. But okay, all right. Okay, hon. I am working on it though. Um, I should have something. Um, it's not by the end of today. I don't know if I'll hear back from them today though. We'll definitely get them all sent over to you tomorrow for sure. Yeah, that's fine. I mean, you know. Okay, all we can do. Okay. All right, hon. I appreciate you. Uh huh. Thanks. Have a good one. Bye.
