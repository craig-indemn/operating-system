Thank you for holding. This is Anna. I can help you. Hi Anna, my my husband wants me to ask you the question because he's not sure. Okay, so the yearly premium just for the with with what we have now for the nineteen ninety eight freight liners how much? Uh, for that the nineteen ninety eight with collision and comprehensive coverage right now is currently four thousand four hundred sixty six dollars. Four thousand four hundred and sixty six dollars for the year. Okay, and for the two thousand seven, great dane, for that one with comprehensive and collision coverage at a thousand dollar deductible, that premium is three thousand nine hundred and five dollars. And that's with comp and collision. And what that means is that, with without that, what does that mean? That. So if you don't carry collision or comprehensive on your trucks, if another truck vehicle hits your truck, you will not have coverage for any of the damages done to your vehicle. Okay, so we're going to keep it the way it is now. But he's comparing because he just finds it since it just comes out automatically of that of that account. But he's like, "Well, this is just very very high. How much is the two thousand two thousand seven freight liner century now? The one that we just added? Yeah, that was the for the three thousand nine hundred five dollars. And how about the great dane? The trailer part? Yeah, two thousand two hundred and fifty seven dollars. Okay, that's with all of them have comp and collision. Correct, all of them have comp and collision at a thousand dollar deductible. Okay, a thousand dollar deductible and that's the. So they they they're completely covered, including the non non trucking and non trucking liability. Correct. That has the liability and your collision and comprehensive coverage. Okay, so from now on, the payment for all three is going to be about a thousand dollars. A month. Um. Let me see what I sent. She's give me one second. Yep. Okay. Yeah. So the remaining until your policy renews, the payments are going to be a thousand thirty one dollars and twenty one cents. Um, and after it renews, it's going to still be around that much per month. So when since we added this vehicle, they pro rated. But I don't know how much more is going to be until that renewal comes out. But when you add a vehicle halfway through, they they pro rated for the remaining of the year. Okay, so let me let me let me call him and let him let's just leave it like that for now until he lets me know. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thanks. You're welcome. Bye.
