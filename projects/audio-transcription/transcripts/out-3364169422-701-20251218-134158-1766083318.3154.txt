Hello. Hey there, Grant. This is just Jeremy. I'm calling from Alliance Insurance. Yeah. How are you doing? No, just fine. Good, good, good. You and I had spoke last week, and I printed off some paperwork for you there and left it up front at the front desk. And they said you hadn't been by yet. Just wanted to remind you that we did have those quotes printed there for you. No, I got them last week. You did. Yeah. I think I did. Not there Wednesday when I was there. Maybe it was just the fact that me and you had spoken. I haven't come by yet. Well, I know we had spoke. Yes, sir. And I think you had said to print out the hard copy there to take a look at it as well. I guess you were wanting to just have another look. Maybe. Yeah, I want to. I want a side by side comparison because you ain't first and you ain't last. I've been to. All right, man. You got it. That's all. You're definitely still in running. All right, I appreciate it, sir. All right, appreciate it. I'll try to get by that morning. Get him. Okay, buddy. That's all. Wonderful. All right, appreciate it. Yes, sir. None.
