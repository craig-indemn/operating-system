Thank you for holding this. It's Tracy. How may I help you? Hey Tracy, Theron Porter here. How are you today? It's Tracy. Oh, I'm sorry, Tracy. That's okay. Give me one second. Let me pull up your account here. Let's see. Theron Porter got it pulled up. How can I help you today? Well, I keep getting bills here from Progressive, and I don't not necessarily understand them or dispute them or anything like that. But January is saying January 10th is a due date on this, and it's saying that owe another forty dollars after I just paid them another install. I just I'm not quite getting it because I paid all this in full on November 4th. Let me look at your policy here. Is it for forty dollars that you're that you received? This one, yes. Okay. And the other day I got another one for like thirty dollars because he was telling me I've been taking off the the paperless discount. Okay. Let's see. Was that something you requested? No. Okay. So you don't mind being paperless. I don't it don't it don't matter to me here regardless I got to pay the bill. If I can get a discount, I would take it. Yes. Okay. I think that's where that forty dollar increase is happening. Well, I don't know because it don't say anything here on this thing that that's what it's about because when they sent me the bill over to paperless discount, it was thirty dollars. Okay. It's saying that I paid the four thousand sixty nine. It's saying that I have a remaining balance of forty dollars. Is what this says. The invoice for the forty. As I'm looking at the activity for your policy, it looks like on the 19th of December there was a change that was processed, and it that's where the forty dollars is coming from, and it says that it is from the. Paperless change. I'm not sure who processed that. Let me see if it tells me here. Doesn't really matter. I'm not here to play the blame game. I just don't quite understand this. So it says that there. Let me go back to it and enrollment not completed. So I'm thinking maybe you received like an email or something, and they just didn't process or didn't process whatever they needed. So let me see if I can get you back on there. Okay, so it says here that the insured must complete enrollment online and accept terms and conditions. If no other policies are currently enrolled in paperless, so you would have to do that on your end. Let me see if I can get that email sent over to you. No, let's just go on and play it and be done with it. I'm not going to be with this company very long at all. You don't want to. I'm not. Damn, I got I'm running three businesses. I've got 25 rental properties. You think I got time to sit down and do a job that I think my insurance people ought to do? No, I do not. So let me just pay you. Well, the system is asking you to just basically accept paperless, and you wouldn't have to pay the forty dollars. But if you want to pay the forty dollars, no, I don't have time to to do the insurance people's job. Okay. Well, it's. Period. And the story, and the story. That's fine. End of it. Okay. Can you accept payment for this? I can. Okay. I'm ready when okay four one one eight seven zero nine eight forty three seventy four twenty seven twenty four. All right, and what's that expiration date? Zero eight twenty eight. All right, that payment has been processed. Oh, what I appreciate your help. No problem. Have a good one. You too. Bye.
