Hello, this Jeff, can I help? Yes, Jeff, this is Kathy of Big Domino Salvage. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Doing fine. Thank you. Good, good, just a quick question because I thought we were all set up on AutoDraft for our account and I see I've got a bill showing that was due on Friday of last week. Uh, it might be showing that date. Let me let me get you pulled up here. Was it from Ascend? It was from. Did you get an email or what? I did. I got an email. Okay. It is. Let me get that pulled up here. It came through at eight o'clock and then I had another one that. Um, I thought I saw another one came through over the weekend. I saw, but there was another one this morning. I'm wondering if it's the same thing. There was a cost to add you to the policy and it wasn't due to driving record. It was actually to for you to be added as an employee to the garage policy. Okay. And it generated. And I'm kind of hemming and hawing until I can get it pulled up. Okay, we'll hold on while you're looking. I'm going to put a call on hold. Thank you. You go right ahead. Okay. Okay, it generated an additional annual premium of like two hundred sixty nine dollars and fifty seven cents. Let me ask you to oh my god. Now no one else can call in all four of my lines. With up, but that's a good thing. Okay, so I do. So that was an additional two sixty nine over the year. So I need to pay that and then we'll then everything else will be. I'm not sure how you set up. See here, here is what we did for you guys and before I. Talk off the top of my head. I'm going to pull it up just so I can see it with my own eyes. But I think. Well, let me get to it here. Okay. All right, so I need to go in here and I can make this payment. So that's not a problem. So that was just. Was that the amount of that bill two sixty nine fifty seven? Did I hit that right? You did. That is correct. Okay. I'm going to put you on hold one second. Sure. No problem. Check that out. Okay, thanks. Yep. Hey, I was Kathy put me on hold. This is Jeff Fed Alliance. Okay, but hold tight. Yep, thank you. That's fine. Okay. Okay, yep, it looks like, uh, the stuff that we did for the Mesa garage policy. It was agency billed through our Ascend agency bill platform. That's what generated the additional premium invoice you got. Okay. Two sixty nine fifty seven. Okay. Now your Progressive policy, I don't have it pulled up. Did you set it up on your own to to make? EFT payment. Did you get a bill? Have you gotten a bill from Progressive or is this the only bill you got? I thought what I got from them was just like. I think I got something. Tell me what the payments was going to be each month. Yep, let me pull that up then. Hang on, I will take a look at that. So are we good on that Ascend bill that you got? Yeah, so I need to take care of that. Yeah. Okay. And that you know I know we talked the other day you you mentioned. You know not to add you as a driver if it was going to cost this this didn't really reflect that it. Actually, there were two little bills built into that one bill that Mesa did. Part of it had not been. It was like seventy or eighty dollars that was. Under quoted from the original quote and then there was the rest of that was to add you as an employee. And so they just lumped that into that one bill that you just took care of this morning. Okay, got it. So that's what that. Right now, yeah. And the Progressive, let me take a look in there. That's eight six two eight. One three two five three. A is your second letter. But don't write on your desktop, but that's awesome. Writing your name that's good. Why don't we get a piece of paper instead of writing on the desktop? Okay. That'd be a better idea. I know what you're into right now. All right, it looks like. You are. All right, I know the first payment was paid through a bank account. And then it shows your installments of one seventy six eighty eight. From now through July. Okay. And I'm let's see. It gives me an option to pay remaining balance, but we're not doing that. We're just trying to figure
