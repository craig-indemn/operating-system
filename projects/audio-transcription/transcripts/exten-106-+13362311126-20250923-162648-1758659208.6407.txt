Sorry about that hole. This is Jessica. Can help you. Hey Jessica John, let's get my voice now. Hey, yeah, I did. Um, I just got back from picking up my son from school, um, and I'm actually looking into it right now. Okay, you want to? I'll get you some time to get caught up on it. Yeah, let me. Let me figure it out, and I got to reach out to underwriting too because this it's not making sense to me. Oh shit. It also said, let me see. So. I still haven't done a damn audit. I hope it has nothing to do with that. I can do that this week. I see something though that says that it was done. Let me see. Yeah, why why should dig into it? Just give me a ring back immediately. Yeah, I'm just worried about it. Thanks about it. Uh huh.
