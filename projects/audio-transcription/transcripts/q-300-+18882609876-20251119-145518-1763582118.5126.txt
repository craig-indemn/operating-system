Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hi, Brandi. This is John calling from Wells Fargo, and I would like to verify some information about the owner's policy. Do you have a policy number? Yes, the policy number is five six two eight two five zero eight zero one. For William Wilson and Lori Chalaway. Right. Okay, and what are you needing to know? Yeah, I just want to verify the annual premium and total outstanding balance for this policy. I'm sorry, say that again. The annual premium amount and outstanding balance amount. Okay. There is no outstanding balance amount, and it was paid eight. It was paid for eight hundred eighty dollars. Okay, and you said policy is paid in full. Yes. Okay, okay, okay. Thank you so much for the information. Uh huh. Have a good day. Nice. Bye.
