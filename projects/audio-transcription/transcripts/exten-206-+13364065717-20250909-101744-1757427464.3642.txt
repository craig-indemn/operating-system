Honey, got a battery dead. You might need to charge it. I don't know if there's a charger down here. Okay. Sorry, nothing. It seems like every time I get on the phone, like if I have my grandkids late, that's when they need something. That's right. I can relate. You start one thing and two things pop up. So that's that's the way life goes. That is, and it's okay because you know they only stay little for a short period of time. That's right. That's right. Okay, so I think you need some information as far as routing and the bank account number so that you can do the auto draft. Okay. Yes, that's it. You just let me know when you're ready.

I've got Big Dog Auto Salvage at gmail dot com. Is that correct? Perfect. Yes. Yeah, what will happen? I'm going to go ahead and do this progressive auto policy and then we'll need some signatures at various times here. It will come through our e sign platform called Conga Sign. That's C O N G A. So if you get something from a funny email named Conga Sign, that's legit. It's from us. Okay. And it'll walk you through the steps. It should be pretty easy.

And we'll we'll be glad to help you. Okay, Jeff. One quick thing. If for some reason that comes through and you hadn't heard from us or whatever, feel free to reach out. Just in case, I'm going to be going out of town for a few days, but I'll probably be. I'll have access to check emails, but just in case you're not going to bug us just if you hadn't seen something. Feel free to call me or Darren and and I'll get it taken care of. Yeah, we'll do that. Okay. That and these these policies are going into effect on September 23rd. Okay. That is the date that your existing policies are expiring. I'm pretty sure that's accurate. But these policies are set to go into force on September 23rd. The only thing that's happening today is the first payment's going to probably be taken from that progressive policy which I think is around 167 dollars. Okay. It'll be set up on automatic draft and you'll get better information once I get this thing issued here. Okay, perfect. If you need anything else, just let us know. Thank you for your help. Thanks Kathy, appreciate it. Talk to you soon. Okay. Yeah. All right. Thanks. Bye. Okay.
