See you, see you, Robin King. Hi, this is Gloria. I'm calling from a Lansing store. And how are you doing today? Good. How you doing, ma'am? I'm doing great. I was just giving you a call back after I saw you a voicemail. How can I help? I was meaning to talk to Jessica. Oh, Jessica is not in office right now. Yeah, when she will be back in? Tomorrow morning. Can you get her to call me, please? Yes, I will. All right, thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Have a wonderful day. You too, ma'am. Bye bye. Bye bye.
