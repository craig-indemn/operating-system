Hey Riley, good afternoon or good morning if you're still in Central time. This is Jeff Edmonds with Alliance Insurance Services in North Carolina. Hope everything's going well today. I have a coverage question regarding policy B seven six nine three nine four. The insured's name is the barn at Heritage Farm LLC. They have some inland marine coverage on this policy that is central to well equipment above ground. And I guess I just had question regarding coverage for the well itself. The insured is actually asking so I was just looking for a little bit of clarity there. If you could please just give me a call back three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three and just wanted to bounce this off of you for just a minute. Thanks Riley, look forward to hearing back from you. Bye bye.
