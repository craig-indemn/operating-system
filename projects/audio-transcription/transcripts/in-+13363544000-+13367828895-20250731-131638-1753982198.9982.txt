Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hi, this is Brent Wells. My son just passed his driver's license. Tessie's just turned 16, and I need to officially add him to the policy as a driver. Okay, all right, Brent. Let me pick on a brief hold for an agent; they can help you get that added. Okay, all right, thank you. Yeah, no problem, and congratulations. That's exciting. Well, I need to see the bill first. Well, you know, everybody has to go through that stuff, so yeah, I understand. Yeah, thank you. Hold on, just a moment, Brent. Okay. Okay, all right, thanks.
