Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Hi, Heather. John Mastasi. Sorry, I just missed your call. Yeah, yeah. How's it going? It's it's going all right. Waiting for settlement to occur here, but again, I got a call last week from New Jersey manufacturers, and they want me to know soon as settlement's over. So my concern is: Is it possible to make my insurance effective midnight tonight for tomorrow? In other words. Let me see. Sometimes. I know we have an effective Tuesday. I think right. Yeah, I think so. What day John? I just want to make sure I'm covered for a drive down. I'm not driving down, so we're going to get wait for settlement to be finished. Right. Finish packing, spend the night in a hotel here, and then drive on down. Yeah, I'm covered. My policy has not expired. You are right. Yeah, yeah, you would definitely be covered. Yeah, we did it for the third, which that that means it tomorrow at midnight. So. Yeah. But my drive, my drive won't be. I'm driving tomorrow, so my question is: Is it possible to make that your policy effective midnight tonight? I can call Cincinnati and see. Usually they are going. Usually they will require us to cancel these policies and then rewrite them. It's not you would think you could just switch the. I know you would think it would just be simple to change the date, the effective date, but most of the time the carriers require us to do a cancel rewrite. But I I mean I'm telling you like you would you're going to be covered. New Jersey is covering you up until midnight tomorrow night as well. How do you know that? You haven't canceled. You haven't canceled that policy. I had not canceled that policy, but they want to know the minute I move out of this house. Basically, is what they're saying. But then they say something about there's a 30 day rule. So I don't know what. It is yes you don't have to yeah yeah I mean that's what I'm saying you do not have to cancel your policies until the third. And you you don't have to cancel them on the third. You could still yes I mean you you have I don't know if it's 30 days in New Jersey but there is there's like. As far as are they talking about your homeowners insurance? No, they're talking about the whole package. I I've been talking mostly to them. I told them I was going to cancel the homeowners. And I guess the umbrella, you know, once you know once we are officially not the owners of the house. Excuse me, but I'm very concerned about the auto coming on down there. Basically, you know. Well, the auto is definitely covered. Yes, yeah, and that's what I'm saying. You could you you could not cancel your auto with them until like 12:15. If you wanted to, but I mean you're going to be covered. You can cancel it at midnight 12:00 on the third. Tomorrow night at midnight. That's what I'm going to do. Okay, very good. Yeah, thank you very much. You're going to be covered. Yeah, if you're driving tomorrow, then they're covering you up until. Well, they're going to cover you up until you cancel it with them. Cancel. Yeah, right. That's what I'm playing. And then you'll also be covered come midnight. 12:01, you'll be covered midnight. I'll understand that you see. Yep. 12:01, but I'll be down. Yeah. Right. 12:0. You're saying 12:01 on today's Monday. You mean on tomorrow night? Right. 12:01 tomorrow night. Right. Is that what you're saying? It'll be 12:03. Yep. Yeah, because tomorrow will be December the second. Up until 12 o'clock, 12:01, it'll turn 12:03. Right. December the third. So Cincinnati kicks in then at 12:01 tomorrow night. Yeah, I just want to make sure New Jersey is going to cover you. Yeah, they're they're going to cover you until. Oh, absolutely yes. Yeah. I'll cancel our policy on Wednesday. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know why they're making a big deal about that. I don't know why either. Because you do they allow you X amount of days like I don't know what their their requirements are there but I know. Now as far as the home, you don't cancel that insurance until you close. Wendy, I'll close on that home
