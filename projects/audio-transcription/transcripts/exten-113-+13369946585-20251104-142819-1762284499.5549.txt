Hey Bobby. Hey Gary, I've been outside, but I didn't know if you tried to call me or not. Hey, that's okay. I saw your name pop up here, so I grabbed it. Okay. Yeah. Go ahead and go ahead and read that number to me. All right, it's two, M as in me, E as an echo, H as in hello, M as in me, seventy five, W as in water, three four, X, six ten, six seventy two, six ten six seventy two. And that's on the Marquis. That's on the two thousand four Mercury Marquis, right? Okay. And both of these vehicles pay for we don't owe anything on them. And liability only, and I'm going to try to get it placed with who you've got the other with, but bottom line is we're just going to try to find your rate. How about that? I need yes yes sir I need cheapest thing I can get because like I said we don't drive a lot. You know and way things are nowadays, prices on everything I don't need my insurance jumping up twenty dollars for no reason. How much are you paying right now? Did they bill you for what now? Ninety dollars a month. They just renewed it. I was paying seventy dollars and sixty cents. It's what I pay for the last six months, and now they renewed it. Want me to pay ninety three dollars or something? So I called to see if there's some kind of mix up. I mean you know, I even asked my wife, "You get a ticket you didn't tell me about," and they said no, is because the North Carolina raised the rates. Yeah, they've been doing that quite often, Bobby. Um. Let's see now. You said all state, but it wasn't National General, was it? No, it was all state. I've been with all state for years. Okay. Yeah, I'm just trying to search out my options here. But I've got your phone number and I won't be able probably to call you back today, but I'll call you back tomorrow and let you know. Okay, I work. I don't work the five hours a day, four days a week. I work tomorrow from seven to twelve, but I'm home about twelve thirty in afternoon. Okay, good deal. Good deal. All right, I appreciate you, Gary. Thank you. Bye bye.
