Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Hi, Heather. Is it Heather? Heather. Hi, Heather. How are you? This is Julia Shaver. I hope you are happy. Yeah, we are happy. Okay, good, good, good. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Job good. Good, good, good. Coming, Christmas coming, New Year coming. Oh no, busy time here, right? Yeah, I just so comfortable with your voice and so godly. Anyway, let me ask a question. I think I also have like a home insurance with with with you, right? Yes. We have your home and auto. Yeah. Yeah, although we are already taking care of that. Um, I did not receive. I think are they the same time or do I need to pay for that one also? Can double check for me. The homeowners. Yeah. Yes, let's let's look and see. Um. It do you still have a mortgage, Julia? Yeah. The mortgage company may have paid that. It's probably escrow. Most homeowners are. But that one is already paid. Is that right? Let me jump. Let me just double check on it. Let's see. I remember. I think they are the same time. And then, oh, they are yes and. Um. Yeah, it hasn't been paid. Let's see. It has not. No, the homeowners have not been paid. Oh really? Oh. Let me see. Is it supposed to be paid by your mortgage company? By what company? The mortgage. Do you still have a mortgage on your home? No, I never. No mortgage. We own the home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right, and I do. I have First Horizon Bank listed. Your checking account ending in nine six three three. Oh, okay. So the money come from there is auto pay. It's not auto pay. No, that's why it's pending. Um. Because it hasn't been paid. Yeah. So do you want me to go ahead and process that payment, Julia? Um. The rate is the rate change. Yes, let's see what you were at. You know, everything has gone up. Yeah, I know. I know what's happening is I I received the auto pay by mail, but I did not see that by mail. So. What kind of I say? I told my husband. I said, "Oh my goodness, so the homeowners renewal is fifteen forty one. " How much last year? One thousand five hundred forty one last year. It was eleven thirty seven. Okay, that's going on a lot. It's so everybody going up, right? It has Julia. That's we. It's. We are hoping next year this is going to level off. Like we're hoping that. I mean, it can't keep increasing like it has been. You know. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, people can afford it. Yeah, I know. It's so crazy. It's it's not just it's a lot three four hundred three hundred something four hundred. Okay, by the way, I have a question. Is that possible? I I think I may can go to the online but it. To send me the amount by email, the the one you just say I'm driving because it's coming to my mind. I say give you a call. Yeah, if you can email me about what you just told me like a last year amount and then this year new amount. Okay. And the date and the date from which month, which date till next month, the date and just some very summarize. Just clear that that just the few numbers most important. So I'm and then I can talk to my husband tonight. Okay. Yeah. I don't think I would do that today. But there's another question. Okay, so can you email me that one? The one we just. I sure can. Yes, and I'll explain in the email. Yes, I will go on for what I'll increase because you know not just the premium went up. It was the coverages. They've increased your coverages too. So yeah. I'll explain all that in there. Yeah, that would be wonderful. That would be wonderful. And then there's another thing I want you to see if you can. Yeah, if you can help. Um. So it's one of my friends. Okay, I Heather. I'm going to still talking with you because I just parked my car in my car garage. I may have to disconnect with the car and then back. Okay. I'm not going to hang up with you. I will still talking to you. Um, I'm going to walk in the kitchen. I will tell you what the. I have other thing I want to ask you because I have friends. Very summer, very basic. Before I go That's come to the another question. So before he is with with with National General. That's the thing. Can he cancel this current with National General and then open another cancel or he have to switch the other company. That's a tricky part, right? The the auto with with National General. Yeah. Yeah. He is with National General right now, but can he cancel the current one and start with another one by himself with you. Right. Yeah, he can. Is it possible? But again, the same thing goes for the home and auto. Don't ever cancel a policy until you secure a new one. You know. Okay. Because it may be that such the, I mean, let's say we go in to run the reports and it comes back something's on there and we can't write. Yes. So he definitely has to make sure he can secure a new policy for home and auto before he cancels any. Yeah. Yeah, he's still on it. He's still in the in the in the policy, and he pays every month. But his his wife name on it, and then the the insurance pretty high every month they pay every month monthly. And then his wife have a two or three claim. That's the thing. That's why jump up so high. Yeah, I know, and then there is one is accident. Two is the the other, break it in her car and then he she claimed the the the the you know the the the the the stop so that of course insurance come go up to very high. Now the couple separate, but they're not living in the same household. No, no. Okay, let me tell. Since you and I we know so long, I am going to tell you a little bit more detail about this situation. And this this gentleman is my client. Is he have some I? You know I help him with this client for over ten years, so I know all his. He has a family issue. The long story short, so the bottom line he don't have a place to stay even, so he stay with me and my husband now. And we have a room for him, and then he address is our address. He we let him change all the address and he leave with us temporarily until he build up his own credit. And then he going to run out. He going to go out and run run his own place, but currently he leave our own place. Before their insurance address is in other place which is apartment. That's under the insurance. The name address is totally different than now. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think. I think so, absolutely. Yeah, we could definitely look at it again. I would not distress enough not to cancel any policies until he has something in place there. Okay, so before we are a little bit confused because I don't know the insurance policy. I thought I thought it um. Is the same company? Is probably we have to looking for the other company since he want to start a new insurance. So, but you told me it's okay. But you know I I am very comfortable with you if you can. Help him to do a new a policy just for him, then I will still let him stay with you instead. Just looking for other company because I before we confused so we don't know that's possible. Right, it does get complicated when these things happen, but I think it's doable, Julia. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So let's let's do that way, and then. Well, we don't have no like a reference, like a reference reference policy like a you know when the people introduced to you and you have reference. Yeah, some some have some now. Yeah. So yeah, if he you know if you can have him. What is his name? Dante Lemon. What is his first name? Dante Lemon.

Yes yes okay. And also give him like hopefully he don't have to pay that much. Hopefully he can pay a little less than what he paid now. Who knows? Yeah, I don't know the whole thing. So you do you need to talk him directly better or what do we think? I can help. I can send. I help you. Do you want to talk to him directly or let him or you call him on the phone?

Now are you you're going to be staying at Julia's right? Uh yes. Okay. So what are we doing with the homeowner's insurance with you and your wife? You said the homeowner insurance. Yeah, she was saying I think you were trying to get it just in your name only. Is that right? Yes. But but you're not going to be living in the home. Correct. I'm just trying to understand a little bit. Okay, who is going to be residing in the house? Um, right now just me because. Currently, the situation my name right now me and my wife are separate. So. Right and I think Julia mentioned you were going to be staying with her. Yes. Who's going to be living in the house that you own that you have insurance? It's asking who's going to be living in the house. Hey there. What's the question? I think you're confused. Can you repeat the question again? Let me sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said Dante will be residing at your home. Yes, right now temporarily, maybe until he gets financial situation set up. Maybe half year, maybe one year. Who knows? Yeah, until he get his. Who who is going to be living in the house that he owns? He own what? I don't understand that card. The homeowner's policy that you said you were trying to get. He is trying to get his wife's name off of. Do they own a home together? They don't have no home. They never have a home. They apartment. They live in apartment. Now they they don't the apartment they lend it all the time. Oh okay gotcha okay. They never have a home. Yeah. Oh sorry about that. Yeah yeah. I was thinking you were saying he needed to get the homeowner's insurance in his name as well. No no just the auto policy. No he they when they live together they run an apartment. Okay. Month by month and then I think they separate. They they since they separate, and um the the wife probably run another place and then Dante have no place so so with a with a temporary provider. Alright him. Alright, alright, that's fine. Yes. So that's clear, right? Okay. Yeah, I was thinking they own the home and we were going to write the homeowner's insurance too. Just in his name. Okay, gotcha. So um, so where just Dante just is looking to get an auto policy in his name only. Correct. Yes. Okay
