This is Rick. I was trying to reach Jeff Edmonds. Oh, yeah, he's my teammate, but not sure how it rang over to me, and I don't know if I can transfer you some cell phone. I can get a message to him for you. What's your name and I can reach out to him and see if I can get him to call you back. Um, Amy Smith. Amy, okay, and let's give me a good number for you, Amy. Uh, seven zero four. Okay. Five, five six zero. Yep. One nine nine six. Nine nine six, Amy Smith. I'll reach out to him right now, and I'm pretty sure he's in the office today. But let me send him a note and I'll try to get him to call you when he can. I thank you, thank you so much. Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
