Thank you so much for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, my name is Kurt Vandry. You have our homeowner's policy there. Yes, sir. And it's coming up for renewal. And I see that I got a notice on the premium, but I've not seen a notice of what the coverages will be or anything like that. Can somebody, email me that? I think it's someone. I went out to. I said I went out to auto owners and couldn't even find anything out there except the renewal bill. Of course. Allow me a moment. Let me get an agent so I can go over the policy and get you exactly what you need. Okay, one second. Okay, thank you.
