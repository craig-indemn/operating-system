It's a great afternoon lines insurance. Here is Jamie. Hey Jamie, this is John Logs. We spoke about a month ago starting to review the policies for the upcoming term. Aida John, yeah, how can I help you? Nicky Porter here. John, give you a last name for me. L yeah L O U D K S. Okay, I got you here. Three ninety one Crowesense Drive in Stokesdale. Correct. Yeah, okay. How can I help you, John? What's going on? Yeah, so couple things. The notice the notifications are coming in with the new premiums, which I mean overall so far so good. I mean I knew that there would be an increase on the auto, and you did forewarn me the increase on the homeowners would go up fairly substantially. What I didn't expect, however, is how much it went up on the homeowners, and I think part of the problem is. They raised the limit of liability on that by over five hundred thousand dollars, which I don't understand. I mean I'd love to see my house increase in value by five hundred thousand dollars, but that doesn't make sense. So okay, so let me get this thing open here so I can see it, and while this thing is loading. Limit of liability. Okay, that is protection for other people. For example, my homeowner's policy has a limit of liability. It's a half a million dollars on my own policy. That's for like let's say somebody was to slip and fall off my front porch and then come to Sydney. Claiming that I should have fixed the step, that five hundred thousand dollars in in coverage. Yeah, that lawsuit. Yeah, that's fine. That's that's personal liability. What I am talking about is the section one coverages for dwelling. It went from eight eighty nine to one million four thirteen. Okay, this thing is loading here, so I can't see it. Yeah, but if that's the case, so in the guts of the homeowner's policy, John, there is an endorsement. It's called Inflation Guard. Okay, what the Inflation Guard does is it tells the policy and the insurance carrier to bump coverage every so often. To keep up with natural inflation that has always historically occurred. Now looking backwards through history, it's been two percent, it's been six percent, it's been twelve percent, it's been whatever it's been. If that number on the dwelling has jumped on the coverage A, then that is the Inflation Guard telling Pen National that that is the new rebuild cost on your home. Over fifty percent in one year. I've seen it. I am working on this line right now. Who got one hundred thirty six percent? Yeah. Okay, depending on what county you live in, depending on the characteristics of the home, it has jumped dramatically. For Jamie, everybody I talked to in the last fourteen to sixteen months. I don't mind researching it for you to see if there is anything we can do on the RCE. But I would, I'd be blunt and tell you this: that's what the Inflation Guard is telling Pen that the coverage should be. Any other carrier that would treat you like, for example, let's let's talk worst case scenario. Let's say you called seventeen other people down the street and said, "Quote my homeowner's insurance." That new carrier is going to use the replacement cost estimator to set the limit based on their new business model. So it may be even higher than what the Inflation Guard is telling Pen National that it could be or should be. Yeah, it is it is a dramatic jump that people are getting on this currently. Let's see, you've got a September first renewal. And I do see one million four thirteen eight hundred on here. Let's see, move it backwards. Okay. So I just did a quick Google search of three ninety one Crowesense Drive. Which this isn't it's Jillo's so I've seen it be. I've seen it be low. I've seen it be high. I've seen it be all over the place. Jillo has the house, four bedroom, three bath, six thousand one hundred twenty one feet. The Jillo estimate is one point five three three million currently. The coverage on your house on this coming up renewal for twenty five twenty six Pen has it at one point four one three so one point four million isn't change. Is there? Have you guys made any substantial updates to the house in the last year or so? No, okay. So what I think I can do for you, John, is to go in and play around with the replacement cost estimator. If it gives me some number in between last year's term and this year's term, I can take that to underwriting to see if they will make an adjustment. Yeah, I don't know what satisfaction that's going to give you. Typically, Does but every time you cut the TV on and you see something stupid that makes you mad well that that affects insurance rates it infects the the insurance appetite I have lived in North Carolina my entire life I have never once ever thought about wildfire burning down any of the properties I've ever lived in but I can tell you factually promise you that once California caught on fire there are insurance carriers now that drop little tidbits of info industry updates into my email not every three days a week now it seems like that they are rating and they are trying to come up with an algorithm to properly rate for wildfire exposure here in North Carolina it is something that is going to be a thing and so I you know where this 1.4 million came up with how they calculated that how the inflation guard actually works John there's nothing that I could show you that would ever probably fully educate you because the truth is they don't even give me that info what I can tell you is that insurance carriers collect data and somewhere in the background of your policy in every policy regardless of the carrier they are factoring in like the individual cost of each nail the shingle the plywood the two before the roofing contractors that would put it back together the electrician that would wire it up and they and there's a lot of angry people at this office that I work for is family owned and operated has been that way for 21 years at some point today one of our longtime clients is going to open the mail and they're going to their head is literally going to fall off in anger John because it's it's just it is adjusting really hard it has been adjusting for the last couple of years it's been adjusting really hard in the last two years and I am I'm I'm at a loss on how to explain it to people anymore because it does not there are things that happen that that piss me off too like my own personal home and auto I have my rubs against the industry at the same time I'll say this I do see it from the insurance carriers perspective because I write policies and then all of a sudden and and the the client we literally just lost a client a few weeks back he he got his renewal in the mail it went up 300 and the client got mad about it and he moved his business to some other carrier and when I was processing the cancellation John I went back to look his insurance went up 300 because we filed a claim last year and the insurance carrier ate 37 thousand dollars buying him a roof so so you know in total he paid two or three years with a premium which equated to about six thousand dollars so he paid six thousand dollars the insurance carrier paid 37 thousand dollars and then he moved his business to another carrier like that that that that conversation happens way more often than not so you know it it it is a crummy deal for the insurance carriers right now until we catch a break from bad weather and idiot drivers I John I don't know when it's going to stop I will mess with this RCE tool and I'm going to take this to underwriting to see if there's some relief that can be found outside of that brother I don't know what other options there are outside of remarketing this to a new carrier completely my hesitation in doing that if I'm being honest with you and I am being honest with you is the fact that if Penn has you at 1.4 some other carrier is entirely likely to look at that and catch you at 1.5 1.6 something higher because it's new business coming in and they know that at some point in time the policy is going to eat a loss they can't underinsure you you don't want to be underinsured no no I'm gonna take the money out of yeah so I'm not I'm yeah I'm not asking it to be underinsured ever I mean that's not my my point my point is I wasn't underinsured last year right for 989 or for 889 I wouldn't think so yes sir yeah but at the same time John I'm not a contractor brother I don't no no no you had a pretty house what what I what I sense happened what I sense happened is you know we were our taxes were reassessed or the real estate was reassessed last year and you know that's fine that happens and that was the more realistic you know tax assessment but the fact of the matter is you know they they also reduce the rate of taxation to accommodate that so yeah did my taxes go up yes did it go up 50 no it went up maybe around 10 and so my my beef again not with you but my beef is how can you say inflation and the cost to replace has gone up probably well if I do the math here about 60 right I say I say something else is even more frustrating than I've seen a lot is you know Penn is giving you almost 500 thousand and granted they're not giving to you that it is a money change
