Hey Holly. Hey. What's doing what? I'll just work and what you're doing. Trying to catch up, like three weeks behind. Who are we talking about on this person? You can share old classics. Yeah, I just need to keep an eye out. So yeah, that's right. So her hubby died, like he fell off, a ladder or something and. Oh gosh. He had some problems anyway, but. So what's the the thing that me and Jamie were talking about is like once we take him off the rate goes up like three hundred and fifty bucks something like that. So we're trying to wait as long as we could, if possible, to make the change, like closer to the renewal date. But I wanted to get off my plate to be honest. Yeah. So if we could create a follow up to do it, you know. Later on, it's up to you. You don't have to, but I was just trying to help her out. And not kill her with an increase, but. That was my thing. I was trying to. I wanted to kind of wait till the renewal before we hit her with an increase, you know. Okay. Yeah, that. If that's possible, just kind of work with her. And then I kind of wanted just to move the case off and. You know, till later on and then and then make the change. So I was moving it over to you because I figured that'd be an easy follow up hopefully. Okay. Yeah, I don't mind calling her on anything and updating her on any of the changes or whatever. I just, I just wanted to get it off my list. Yeah. If that's possible, so. Is that okay? Yeah, I was looking. I found the case here. So she, does she know we're going to try to wait or do? Well, I only think she knew to do it. Like we were, that's just something that we would have done. I got you. You know, but I don't know. I mean, if we got pressure to do it, I don't mind doing. I was just trying to feel bad. So. I know, but if we have to do it, we have to do it. I was just, I was just going to wait, but I'm. Kind of wanted just get off my plate. See. You know a follow up closer to the renewal. That's what I was thinking. Okay. Yeah, we can do that because I guess I mean unless Safeco actually sends us something. Right. Let's say just do it on their own or whatever or. A reminder and then we just need to do it. I get it, but I was just trying to help her out as much as I could. Yeah, we can do that. I'll just keep on it. Okay. Hey Holly, you going to that thing tomorrow? I guess. That's what everybody's saying. All right. It's fun fun Corbin. It's fun fun. We'll see how that is. I know. That's my concern. I know you got to wear some gloves. Are you going? Yeah. You like golf, don't you? When it's nice, frustrating when you're. You know it's freezing and it's not going where you want it to go. It's frustrating. Well, we'll figure it out. All right. Well, thank you, Holly. Oh, on this um, I got one more thing for you real quick. Yeah. On Hamza, what is he talking about with these? Do you know these? He wants. Oh yeah. Transferred back to the ZV something. I've been trying to call him like all day because his one of his policies canceled and saw my list. It looks like it needs to be changed back. You know how you changed it. If I'm reading it correctly. You know how we changed it. Now he wants to change back. You remember that one? I think he did it actually or or I had um. I might have had Marblebox do it. I don't remember. I haven't dug into it, so I just email. So I'll look into it. Yeah, if you need anything else, just let me know. I wait on him to call me back. But um, but thanks Holly. Oh, in that Vance, we could talk about that later. But he's living up in Virginia now. So at some point when you get those rewritten up there. Yeah, I had um I had Marblebox quoted. I think I had a yeah I have attached there ready. So do you want me to just review them and let you know or you want me to? If you could put it to an email because I'm supposed to call him today. He's buying a car for his son, and we're putting him his son. We worked on it
