Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Hello, Brandy. This is Barry Vernon. You just called me and left me a message. It seems that you and I are trying to accomplish the same end here. I'm trying to send you some money and you're trying to get me to. Um, I've been trying to to pay our travelers bill online, but it it it keeps saying that there's there's a problem doing that and and and I can't get it done. So what what do we need to do here? So I was giving you a call because the policy is actually canceled because of non payment, and I reached out to travelers to see if there was a way that we could get it reinstated and they will not allow reinstatement because it's happened too many times. Um, so we'll have to end up rewriting you a new auto policy with a different company. Well, Brandy, that's not quite fair because I've been trying to pay the bill and it won't take it. Right, so because the policy has been canceled since September 8. They shouldn't have done that. I've been trying to pay it. They shouldn't have canceled it. Not when I'm trying to pay the bill. So did you try to make a payment before the 8th? Because that would have been you should have been able to make a payment before then, but after that you can't because the policy is canceled. I didn't write down what the dates were though I didn't. Okay, um. So I can try to call and get somebody else, but they have specific rules whenever it comes to reinstatements and after three times they they won't reinstate. I can try and call and do my best to get them to see if they will reinstate, but if they say no, I can't. The only thing that I can do to get you coverage on your auto policy is to get you another company. The last time we went through this, I asked you guys to put this back on draft. They told me they would put it on draft. They obviously did not put it on draft. I'm going to say this is an alliance problem. And if we can't get it done, I'll call Christopher myself and deal with it. Barry, I'm going to do my best to try to reach out to travelers, but if they say no, I can't do anything else. We can go with another company. If you wanted it to be set up on auto pay in the past, um, that might have not been an option because travelers does does not let anybody go back on auto pay after it's been um. Cancelled for non pay several times. I was told that it would go, that it would go back on auto pay, and that's that that was the assurance that I had. And just let me know what you can find out if you will. Yes, I will. All right, I'll listen to hear from you. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Hmm.
