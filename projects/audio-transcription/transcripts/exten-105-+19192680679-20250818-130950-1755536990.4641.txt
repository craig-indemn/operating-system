Is this Rick? Hey Rick, this is Ted Bradley. I can barely hear you. Ted, sorry, this is uh. Trying to work on a new technology here. Hang on just a minute. I got you good now. That's a little better. That's much better. Yeah. Good deal. Yeah. I've been good. I've been good. How about yourself? Yeah, doing all right. Doing just lovely ready for ready for fall one. Oh, you and me both. That was a month ago. More so more so now, but hey, I was just a couple things. I was calling number one to see if you guys are working on anything. Work comp wise that we could help you with. Yeah, my immediate off cuff answer. I don't know. I'm not. Okay. I have seen a ton of you comp heavy stuff here lately. It doesn't mean there might not be something in the. In the pipeline that I'm not up to speed on. I try to look at those opportunities. Not once a week and I haven't just Monday and I haven't looked last week's pipeline just yet. But. Sure. We our team meets every Wednesday and sort of has those conversations. But but yeah, we see I just don't know off top of my head. But certainly we'll keep you guys in mind when it's when it's an opportunity that might make sense. Yeah, well I appreciate it. Rick, I'm not sure. Are you do you recall are you aware of our wholesale agency that we started? Sure. Yeah, I think I think very aware of it. You know, also cool options if you bring the people with that that that broker type things maybe not the right word that's kind of you know the terminology that I use but. But yeah, I've sort of looked at it. I think I've poked around a little bit on some of the emails you may have sent maybe a little bit on website that might be some information out there seems like it's been a while. Maybe a little deep look at it, but I'm aware of it. Okay. So we the only person we have on your agency that's registered is Christopher. So as far as registered users, so what I'd like to do is is see if we can get you guys registered. Sure. Yeah, we all we all have our we all have our we all have our own IDs. Right. But only just give me a second here. Well, I think maybe what you're saying is that the brokerage registration is a is a difficult process than just first benefits registration. I mean, I know I've got my own user ID. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Two separate portals. Yeah. Yeah. I follow. Hang on, let me see. See if I see that other portal here. Give me just a minute. Sure. Yeah, I just see. I'm just looking at my password manager to see that's where I store all these user IDs. You're right. Yeah, I don't see anything. I don't see anything there. Why don't you? I would just suggest send them to to myself and you know the account managers here. Do you do you have those current contacts? Because that's something I could send you. If you could send me send me that information, that would be great. I mean, I have a list here. I can go through it with you. If yeah, just just tell me who you got and I'll I'll send you. Okay, so so I've got Brian left with yes yes. I got Chase Smith. Nah, he wouldn't use it. Okay. All right, Brian, and then I have Cecilia Martinez Cruz. Okay. She should I have more she she Brian Brian and myself and Cecilia should probably be admins if there is such a thing. I don't know if that's part of the registration process or not. But no, it isn't. As far as being admin, no, you you're just all going to have a you know your own login and then a lot of it self serve. You just log directly into the. The carrier, but what I would do is I'd have I'd have our guy do a do a. I'm going to send him everybody's name and email, and then he's going to reach out for a you know an onboarding. Take you know 10 15 minute onboarding walk you through the the whole thing. We'll figure it out. Maybe we can get them get everybody together. Yeah, at the same time like herding cats sometimes a wolf kind. Oh, he'll do it one at a time. Don't no worries. So and that might work better anyway. Sometimes it does. We'll figure it out. Yeah, but Brian Cecilia, obviously myself. You got Christopher Stein Morgan though. John Odell. Yes. Anastasia Joyce. Yes. Okay. Jeff
