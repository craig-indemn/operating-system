Hello. Hey Austin, this is Corbin with Alliance. Hey Corbin, hey doing man. Doing good, doing good. Thanks for calling me back. I sorry I couldn't get to the phone yesterday, but. No, you are fine. You are fine, man. I thought this was a reset because I was I just talked to the loan officer just a minute ago. I was like, okay, he's bought another house. I said I just talked to that kid and bought one. Yeah. Yeah. Not long ago. But um but yeah did did you get any of the home details because I wanted to give you guys the first chance to give me a quote on that. Yeah, I am pulling it up now. So I am kind of. I just want to kind of run it through it with you. I can't tell because you know how the pictures are lined. Never good. Yeah. Um. So I was looking at. Is it a townhome or is it connected? I think it's technically a cluster home, but they don't share a wall with anyone. Oh, so it's separate. It's a separate building. Yeah. Yep. But from what I understand, the HOA still is responsible for the roof and the outside. So. Um. So probably. So what what you doing with the other home? Are you hanging on to it or? We're gonna we're gonna sell it. That's that's plan number one. Okay. So the home the home being both names are just yours. Um, the loan is in my name, but I think we'll both be on the title. Okay, cool. And then um. Let me make sure I got. Unless there is any advantage to to doing it another way. Not really. I mean, I you know they base they base rates on score credit scores now. I don't even know what those credit scores are, but the more I feel like if I put two people in there, you just never know. Yeah. But that's kind of the way I like to do it if it's okay. Yeah, I mean that's fine. Um, I think her credit score is somewhere around the seven thirty five and mine was seven seventy five. So the average should still be pretty high, but mine is higher. Okay. And. See, she sent me the loan amount. Two fifty eight. Well, no, it's two. Oh six something because of the down payment. Two oh six four. Yeah. Let me see. She wants specify within how. If it's excluded and remarks. So she's not worried about deductible. Type of cost. Okay. So. Do you have a minute? I could quote it for you real fast. Uh yeah, I mean we just kind of showed up on the job site here, but I've got a few minutes. I could I could probably steal. It's quicker because you got all the details. Yeah. I can just fly through it. So. I am a quote as an HO three closing date the twenty third. Entity individual. And then I'll put both names. Austin. Elena, now you say say her name Elena. Elena. Alyona. Yeah. That's a cool name. Yeah. See, you got. You are moving from Turnwood. Put that in there. So you are downsizing. No, I mean it's it's uh. I got I got a lot of customers that live in tiny homes. They probably like fifty. I mean they are executive. Oh man. Yeah, I got. Honestly, I would take a tiny home. It's the real reason we're moving is our neighbor, man. Oh crazy. Yeah, I mean. He's just he's just aloof and he doesn't seem to care about the fact that he doesn't live in the woods. I mean he he blasts grimo music at three in the morning. He you know he smokes like a freight train. It's just like oh we put up with it for long enough. Oh, I am sorry, man. That sucks. Yeah, we bought the house and no one lived there, so it was kind of like you know a little bit of a gamble, and then he moved in and life got worse. So it's like oh. Oh no. That's crazy. Soon there is no claim history right, and you got your home with them and auto. You get that credit. And then. Twenty third. What's your date of birth? Awesome. Uh, November eighteenth ninety four. And it's all brick, all four sides. Um. Hmm. I wouldn't know. I don't think it's brick on all four sides. Unless there is. Vinyl. On top of the brick, but I don't think that would be the case. I usually put it either frame or brick. If it's more brick. Or more frame, that's the one I use. Hmm. Two baths, what two full and um. Two full, yeah, three bed. Thirteen hundred four square feet. There's a picture in the back. Yeah, see, so it looks like the so that just that first left part in the front is brick, right? Everything else is vinyl. Yeah, I think so. Man, I wish I don't really have pictures, but. That's what it looks like online. I don't. Because it does a corner shot. Yeah. And are those trees hanging the home? They are. I want to work on getting those cut back because. We already are in the process of that. I mean that's. I think primarily on HOA, but we definitely we already noticed that with the inspector. Yeah, because insurance company ones all the all the care is will inspect and they'll say, you need those cut back because the limbs could fall. Puncture the roof, so they. You know that that could be. I'm not saying they're gonna 100 do that, but I can see them going out and possibly giving you a. One of those fix need to fix that thing. Hmm. Yeah, two car garage. Good man. Got a deck in the back. Patio. Okay. All right. So give me the replacement cost of two sixty two. Just right on. Is it gas heat? It is not. They listed it as gas heat, and I was excited for that, but it is a heat pump. Okay. There is a gas, natural gas fireplace. So I don't know if that counts, but. Oh, you did. The unit itself is a heat pump, but you don't have a tank, right? You could possibly get gas if you ever change it out. If you don't have a. Yeah. Okay, that's good. Maybe to make your insurance for future. Um. All right, and then do you know when the electrical was updated last roof heating and air? Electrical inspect the inspector on the panel looks like 2015. The roof. I think was. It's probably. I mean, but would that matter though if the HOA is responsible for the roof? Yeah. Because of the because of damage leaks inside possibly. I could guess I couldn't tell you but I could guess the the the roof's about ten years old. Okay. Inspector said it was in good shape. He had some pictures. Good. And are you um? Are you escrowing your payments or are you guys paying separately? Okay, escrow. All right. What. And you can see other homes from your home. I'm sure. Not on the island. Any animals or pets. We do have one cat. Catch catch don't count. I'm just kidding. Yeah, goldfish. My cat passed away the other day, and then it was sad. Oh man. It was hard because she she was 15. I mean 15 years old. It's crazy. She just stopped eating. I stopped eating and then it kind of went downhill. Yeah. I guess she's in a lot of pain probably. Um. I don't know if I'll ever get another cat. My kids love her, but. They're in college now. They don't need a cat. I don't need a cat. But yeah. It might get lonely. Yeah, I think I'd rather have a I have a dog. The dog's enough. Geez. Yeah, well, that's true. Keep you busy. Would you like to do a self inspection? The. You have the option. They can come and do it for you, or you can they'll send you a text and you just. Takes ten minutes. You go around and take a video or a picture. They'll send you the instructions. Unless you just want them to do it. Um. What would you suggest? I would suggest you do it. Yeah, well I I don't mind. The only issue is I don't have access to it until we close really without the people. Yeah, you got plenty of time. Yeah, this is after closed anyway. Yeah, you'll be in. Okay, then yeah. Then you can do it. Okay. Yeah, I recommend that. But you can help a lot of the. Pictures and stuff. You had deadbolt locks, fire extinguishers, smoke detectors. Make sure you get those. Yeah. And then we got the mortgage information. Right now, it's going to be escrowed. Buddy. Will that list be in the? Um. In the info, I'm looking for. Yeah. Okay. Because I can make sure I have all that stuff on hand. Yeah, it's pretty easy. Dude, the mortgage company is going to be canopy mortgage. Right. I don't have that on my list. You know how I had that. Well, you you probably deal with a lot of
