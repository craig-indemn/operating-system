Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Turn. Somebody help you. Hi, this is Karen. Yes, this is her. Hey, this is Jacob Covington from Cyber Gear. How are you? I'm good. How about you? Good. Um, CC gave me your extension. So we're working on installing the check scanner software again. Can I remove it and take a look at that? Yeah, give me one second to just get it put up for you. Sure. Okay, I'm in the system now. If you want to log in. Right. I think this should be you. Yeah. All right. So. Let's do. Is the scanner currently plugged in? Yeah. Okay, I think they usually want us to unplug it while we install everything. Can you unplug that for me? Okay, one second. Perfect. Let's do this. Alright, let's make sure everything installed there. Should see Teller scanner and the D420. Well, I don't see the Teller scanner. All right. Let's go ahead and plug that scanner in and see what we get. Let me check device manager. Okay, let's plug in. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, the part that's supposed to kick off did not. I wonder if I need to log in as an admin. Let's. Let's go. Yes. Let's try that one more time. Now, and let's start the Teller scanner again. No. I. Okay. There you go. Hmm. Alright, well, not great news. Um, it's out here. Um, come on. There you guys. He'll sign back in for me. Um, had this happened before, and there is a chance that maybe they know how to fix it now. Um, because we can never get a clear answer out of their support. On what was actually causing the issue, but we know it's happening. Um, so there's a part of their installer. Um, or there's a set of software in the installer that is not getting installed. Um. Let me get back to. Oh, it's on the admin thing. That's fine. Um, it's not installing the Teller Scanner, which is what allows the scanner to talk to the web portal. Um. Last time that happened, we had to completely factory reset the machine to fix it. Um. Let me um. Let me give CC a call and see if we can get some clarification from the support. And see if maybe they can. Whether this support tech that y'all have talked to this time can maybe provide more information on what's actually going on and why it's not installing that. Okay. Um, but let me let me reach back out to CC and um and talk to her about it. Okay. Alright, thank you very much, Karen. Thanks. Bye.
