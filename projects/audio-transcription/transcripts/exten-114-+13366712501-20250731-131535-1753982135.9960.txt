Thank you for holding. This is JC. How may I help you? Hi, this is Casey Tuttle calling you back. Hi, I was I have received a message earlier about an FS one. Yes, I received it. I sent you an email. I just wanted to confirm. Did you receive a notice from the DMV? I did. Okay. Well, Department of Transportation, yeah, Division of Motor Vehicles, yep, yep. And I have a control number also if you need it. Okay, um, first I need. Okay, well let's backtrack. Um, if you don't mind, just confirming your address. Um, one ten Long Bridge Drive, Kernersville, North Carolina. All right, in that TO box is what we have on file. Twenty four forty seven. Yeah, go ahead and update it. Okay. What was that new address? One ten Long Bridge. Long Bridge is one word. And that's drive in Kernersville. Two seven two eight four. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so I've updated that. And on that form, do you see a date on there? Typically, it says, um. You know, you needed FS one for this vehicle on the date. Um, she's already said it's been revoked and I have a penalty of fifty dollars. Um, let's see, contact insurance carrier. Uh, just says your plate was revoked on seven twenty four. Seven twenty four. Hmm. I am wondering if they okay. So what we can do is um, do you mind? I am going to. Send you a text message if you wouldn't mind just sending me a picture. I am thinking. Because the FS one wasn't sent, is this the first notice that you received? Um, no, it's the second notice. So I received a notice from them and then I got a notice from I think it's auto auto owners. Um, I got a notice from them saying it was canceled. I paid it immediately. Then I got another notice from them saying it was reinstated. And now I am receiving this notice from the DMV saying my tag has been revoked. Okay, let me see here. It looks like an FS one was filed. Earlier this month, so let me take a look at these notes one second. Okay. Okay, yeah, so it looks like an FS one was filed already. So let me just take a closer look. To see what exactly we have to do, I am going to send you that text message and just send me a picture of it. And um, I'll see who we have to contact or what we have to do. Okay. And I am sending the text message now. All right. All right, that's sent and I'll just wait for. The picture and I'll be in contact with you. My name is JC. Okay, awesome. Thank you so much. You are welcome. Have a good rest of your day. Thanks. Bye. Bye.
