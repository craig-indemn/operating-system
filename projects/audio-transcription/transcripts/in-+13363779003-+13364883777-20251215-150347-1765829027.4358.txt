So much for calling Alliance Insurance. Hey, um, I'm calling from an auto wash shop. I'm trying to help my customer get their claim filed, and I do have their policy number. I'm just trying to check and see if I called the right number. Okay, policy number first. Um, it's a business auto policy, so D A T, and then the number part is two zero two six seven one three dash one seven. Okay, thank you. And what are you trying to do? Um, I need to help them file a claim. File a claim. Okay. Only one second. Let me get one of the agents to help you with that request. Okay, one second. One second.
