Sorry for your hold, is this Cody may help you. Hey Cody, this is Sunny, hey Sue Cruz's wife. Hey, how are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm good. Um, I was calling because I'm trying to figure out this DOT thing and he said that you showed him the pages and he can't remember and I don't know where to go to even start. Okay. Um. What have you done so far? Who have you. Um nothing at all. Like I don't know where to go to apply. Okay. Um. Give me just a second. All right, so if you go to. Fmcsa. He said S. Uh, F is in Frank, M is in Mary, C is in Charlie, S is in Sam, A is in Adam. Okay. Dot. Dot. Gov. Okay, I think I got it. So that is the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Okay. They are the government organization department I guess that handles everything DOT trucking related. Okay. Um on that website there should be a phone number down at the bottom. Yeah, I see. Um so I would suggest calling them directly and speaking with them on getting a DOT set up and where you need to go and what you need to do. Okay, sounds good. I appreciate you. Um, make sure when you are selecting the classification. For him, are the the truck and trailer registered titled in his personal name. No. Who's the title to? It's a family member's name. Okay. Um. Has it done that reason that way because of financing situation. Yeah, just because he's buying it from uh from his cousin and then he's still paying it all so they haven't put it in his name. Okay. Creates a bit of a problem because the DOT needs to match what's on the policy. Um. He needs. The DOT needs to be in his name. Right. But the truck is titled to somebody else. He needs to. You need to draft up a lease agreement from the cousin to him. That the cousin is leasing the vehicle to him. You know rent to buy situation or whatever, but it needs to be like an official document signed by him and his cousin. Um, because the policy needs to go in his name, not cousin's name because the DOT needs to go in his name because. The cousin probably already has a DOT number. I would imagine. Yeah. Um. How long does he have until he pays it off? Oh, I don't know. Yeah. He's just starting this, I imagine. Yeah. Um. So you definitely need to get a lease agreement drawn up like an official legal lease agreement, you know stating. All the details of the agreement on how much he's paying and how long he's paying and all that sort of stuff. Okay. Um, you can look up a lease agreement template online. Probably that would help with that. Okay. If you just Google vehicle lease agreement, like I don't know, you could probably make it more specific like. Individual to individual vehicle lease agreement or something like that. These days you can find about anything just by googling it, right? Oh yeah. Um. So get you know that taken care of, and then the DOT needs to be set up in his name. Um. When you do. Let's see. So when you are filling out the paperwork, I don't know if it's online or paper or how they do it, probably online these days. Um. So the operation, if you want to write this down, the operation classification. Okay. Needs to be private property, not authorized for hire. Do not do authorized for hire under any circumstances. Private property. Yeah, because when they pick up these buildings from the manufacturer, their subcontractor agreement with the manufacturer reads. That these buildings are their property when they pick them up. Right. So when you set up your DOT, this is a way to get it. This is basically the way the carport industry is. Set things up to get around being for hire on the DOT. So make sure on the operation classification that it's private property only. No authorized for hire. Okay. Okay. And then obviously for the carrier operations it needs to be interstate, not intrastate. Because interstate means you are going to other states as well. Not intrastate. Correct. Okay. Make sure that one's interstate and then like the cargo carried carried usually just like metal sheets coils and rolls is one of those options. And building materials is another option. So those are probably the two main ones. For the cargo that he'll be hauling, carrying whatever. Okay. Um. And then obviously just you know it needs to be in his personal name since you know he's leasing that in his personal name from his cousin. Address, phone number, all that sort of stuff. Okay. But just call that Fmcsa and get that
