Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Hey Heather, this is Stephen. How are you doing? Oh good. How are you doing? Yeah, it's been a while trying to get back and forth with in touch, but I am not sure if we ever got into any of the details of trying to get a homeowner's policy. Oh no, we haven't. I just got your email and then we just been tagging one another. So. What I was going to tell you is that the house itself is a nice house. It's four bedroom, twenty four hundred square foot, two and a half bath, with double car attached garage. And it's getting ready. I think they've already ordered the shingles. It's supposed to be getting the roof on it. Maybe at the end of next week or the week following. So it's getting ready to have a brand new roof put on it. But you know you may not even put a policy on it until then. I don't know you know what you are. Well, tell me what you are required to you know. Excuse me. Yeah, have you purchased it already? It's for my son. He it's his house. It's from his mother passing away. And so he's working all the time. So I was trying to get the thing lined up for him. And it's in Salisbury. And so we're trying to get the policy for it. You know, whenever it you know if it's one of those things where you got to wait till you get the roof on it. You know I've heard that they're the one I gather they're they're really getting strict about the roofs. They are, but the the my main concern right now is we can't do anything until it's deeded. It's the deed in his name. Yeah. Okay. How long has he had it? Huh. How long has he had it in his name? For for several years. Oh, so he he doesn't have it insured currently. It's got insurance on it, but the policy is going to be expiring in I think a couple December the seventh something like that. Oh okay. So we were shopping around to see what else we could get. Absolutely, yeah, okay, for sure, yeah, we could definitely help you. Yeah, so what is that address? Is five two five Trexler Loop, which is T R E X L E R L O O P Salisbury, North Carolina two eight one four four. Okay, all right, and yeah, I mean, so that would be I could quote it with a new roof. It doesn't expire or renew until December seventh. So we would go ahead and be on there by then. Right exactly. So that would be great. Yeah, as long as it's insured currently insured. Where I have an issue is if it's not had insurance on it. You know it's got no insurance on it right now. Okay, that's what I was afraid of. I thought that's what you were saying. I was going to say that the policy would probably quote it from November the first. Will be the best thing. I think would be better the sooner the better. You know for the insurance. Well, I mean if he's got insurance up through December seventh. Yeah, but I want to go ahead and because it's expensive insurance. So let's quote it until. November the first. Okay, who's it? Who's it with? I don't even know it's vendor insurance. The policy was canceled. We didn't even know the policy was canceled because of the roof. And when we found out about it, they'd already placed a policy on it. It's a you know it's got a it's the house is valued at like. Two hundred and fifty something thousand dollars with the tax value, but it's only got a it's only got fifty thousand left owed on the loan. And they you know got for some reason we didn't we didn't even know they'd cancel the policy on the on the roof. So they're going to put the policy on the roof and we're trying to put the policy back on there as soon as the roof gets replaced. When when did that happen? When did the policy cancel? It's been several months ago, but we've been didn't realize what the reason was for. But you know then we've from investigation they found out the roof was a you know the roof they say if his roof's not ten years. Are younger that they you know they can they won't even insure some houses with with how with if it's not you know I mean they're getting very strict about the roofs. And I didn't I didn't have no idea that we wouldn't have any any issues with the roof. The roof wasn't leaking. Or anything, but they just I guess it was hurricane hurley or something had something to do with it. And some people
