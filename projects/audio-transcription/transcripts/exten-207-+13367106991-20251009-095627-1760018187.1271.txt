No. Sierra Structures LLC. There it is. So you are the business owner and the actual lead installer on the job sites too. Yeah. Okay. I haven't had too many female installers that actually installed. I've had a lot of female business owners, but. Well, I am helping my husband, but I try to go when I can because we just had a baby too. So. Maybe in the future I won't be going, but right now I am a little bit healthy. Okay. Looks like you are the only member of the LLC correct. Yes. Okay. Could I put you on a quick hold? I am so sorry, my son is calling me and I need to know what he needs. Go right ahead. Okay, sorry I am back. You are fine. And is this one fifty four Brookfall Dairy Road in Elk and is that the correct home address for you? Yes. Okay. Are you going to be working for NC Carports the right near you? Five stars metal building. Five star. Okay. I just know you are right there near NC Carports office. Yeah. There is like two other ones near me too. Yeah, they're everywhere these days. Is this your cell phone number? And your full your full name is Brenda Benitez. Is that right? And Brenda Sierra Benitez. Sierra's your middle name. Technically, it's my last name, but yeah, they missed it up. It's one. It's yeah. I have two last names, but. Okay. Yeah, so Sierra and Benitez are your last names. Yes. And this is your cell phone number, Brenda. Yes. Okay. I also called you yesterday, but I left the voicemail. Yeah, I did get that. I just got into the office. I was going to give you a call back once I was able to. I was just kind of getting going this morning. I had some couple things I had to do before I came in. No, it's fine. And then what is your email address? I want to use the one for the business so that way anything that I get for them I rather use that one. Okay. It is A A Sierra Structures LLC at Gmail dot com. So A A Sierra Structures LLC at Gmail dot com. Yes. Okay. And what is your? Do you have the EIN number for? Yes. Yes, I do. Is that the identity? That's the identification number, right? Yeah, the employer identification number. Yeah, it is three nine dash four four one four four five one. So three nine four four one four four five one. Yes. Okay. And what is your social Brenda? It is five nine one thirteen forty one seventy. And your date of birth. Five twenty one nineteen ninety one. And you said you need general liability and workers' comp. Yes. So you are the owner of the company. Do you need to be covered or do you want to be excluded from the workers' comp policy? Is it going to cost the same? No, so if you are covered, then I have to use this year the amount that we have to use for an LLC member is sixty two thousand four hundred in payroll. To include you, which means if you were to get hurt, that you would have coverage. If you are excluded and you get hurt, you do not have any coverage. It's no, it's fine. I have I have two jobs, so I am covered into the other job I'm just throwing out ballpark figures here, okay, so don't quote me on this, but I mean you're probably looking at six or seven maybe on the general liability and the inland marine, which the inland marine part of the package covers your buildings in the in transit to the job site, like on the way to the job site and stuff. While they're at the job site, it's like something happens to the materials. It also covers all of your tools and stuff. So that policy is with that amount of payroll, it's probably going to be six or seven or something like that I would imagine. The workers' comp with 160, 000 in payroll is probably going to be in the 11 to 12 range for the year. So total, I mean I think you're probably looking for these two policies around probably 8, 17, 18 or something like that is just my ballpark guess. 18 hundred a month. Yes, so 18, 000 for the year, so more like 1500 or something a month probably is my guess. Oh okay. So it's definitely not cheap, but you guess you also have to understand that when claims happen, usually they're pretty severe in this industry, and there's just not many companies that will insure carport installers anymore. Basically every company out there has insured them at some point, and most of them won't won't touch them anymore because they have too many claims usually. So I will just tell you, it's extremely important to be safe, to have your guys stay safe on the roads at the job sites when they're working and all that, and not have any claims. Because companies are going to be quick to non renew policies, you know if you start having claims and stuff. Okay. Just it's very important just you know, don't drive in people's yards because even though they tell you to, they're still going to want you to pay for it once you dig a bunch of ruts in it when it's wet. That's one of the most common things I've ever seen. I think. Just be extra careful on ladders and on the roofs and stuff when they're doing all the panels and and putting stuff up and all that and. Just do your absolute best to not have anybody get hurt or hurt anybody else or damage anybody's property. You definitely don't want to file claims if you can avoid it, like little small claims. You know you probably just want to pay those out of pocket instead of filing an insurance claim. Anyway, that's just kind of my my normal spiel that I I tell installers, especially new installers when they're kind of getting into this for the first time. Oh my goodness. Very overwhelmed. Yeah, it's it's not really it's pretty basic, you know it's technical but it's it's pretty straightforward. Be careful, don't get hurt and you won't have any workers' comp claims. Don't damage anybody else's property or hurt anybody else on the job sites, the homeowners or whoever else. Could possibly be there. Just biggest thing is just to be safe, you know just be careful what you're doing, what they're doing on the roads. Just be careful. That's all I can say. I guess. Yeah, I do have one question because now that you just mentioned, I just remember something else. I also work for her sometimes at the shop, so I have two separate paychecks, but they're all both she makes both of them under the business name. But I know for that one, when I get paid, it's 75, 000 like a year exactly because she paid. And you get paid by who? I'm sorry. By Five Star Metals Building. So you work at Five Star. Yes, I also work at the shop. So you work in the shop at Five Star. Yes, but where I have the truck, she also. I do both that you could say like both jobs. I install and then I also work at the shop. Okay, so you work in this shop at Five Star, but then you're also going to be an installer for Five Star. Yeah, so that's where the part where I might not be going on the with them as much anymore. Uh huh. So would so the lead could be my husband you could say now. Right. I had to think about. But you're still going to pay him as if he's an employee because technically you are the business owner of the LLC. Yes. So the LLC is going to pay your husband and then three other guys every week or every run or whatever, correct. Yeah. Okay, yeah. So you just have to keep up with his payroll just as if he's any other employee because you are the LLC owner, not him. So you have to pay him each run just like he's any
