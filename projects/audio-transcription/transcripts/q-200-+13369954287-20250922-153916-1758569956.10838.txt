Corbin, may I help you? Hey Corbin, my name is Jacqueline Ramness. Um, I'm actually calling on behalf of my dad, Vidish Ramness. He currently has a homeowner's insurance policy three guys. But I want to call and get another quote just to see if you know there are better pricing out there now. Okay. And let's see. You know one second for me. Yeah. Somehow I just fall out of my system. Let's see. Let me walk back in here. All right, and spell that last name for me. R A. Emma's and Mary, Emma's and Nancy, A T. Is in Tango, H is in Hotel. And what's the first name? Vidish, V I D I S. Okay. On what's the address there? Five zero one six Hutchinson Street, Winston Salem. Okay. Yeah, looks like he got him with heritage. Yep. He renews tomorrow. Um. Yep. Has is it does he have a mortgage on it? No. And how old is the roof? Um, I want to say it is within seven to five years old. It's a fairly new roof, or well, yes roof. Okay. So it's pretty new. Five zero one six Hutchinson. Okay. And does he have any trees overhang in the house or anything? Or. Uh no no we don't have any. Has he had any claims or anything? You can think of. No, no claims either. Okay. And then we want to keep everything pretty much like what it is on the, the heritage policy. Let me see if I can pull that up. If now I do have the decal in front of me as well. Are you shopping in due to the rate increase? Pretty much. Yeah, pretty much. Gotcha. Yeah, just trying to find a better price out there. If there is one. All right. So it's building eighty six. I don't know if this matters, but he is married as well. I don't know if you guys had that previously. We just have his name. Um. Does he? He have auto insurance with us. I don't see it. No, it's not with you guys. It's with my different company. Okay. Would he be willing to let us quote that? I would say probably not. We have a really good rate. Where we're at currently. Okay. We try to have more than one policy. If possible. Yeah, and it gives you a better discount. Yeah, normally it's it's. Better for the consumer too because we should be super. Yeah, I don't mind re-quoting this as long as you promise to give us a shot at the auto. In the future. I don't know if I can make that promise. Like I said, like I want to say we have how many vehicles on that one. One, two, three, four. Four vehicles, four drivers, and we're in below two hundred. Yeah, I don't. That doesn't matter. What carrier? Oh, well, that's one of our companies. So. Yeah, figure that much. If you did a, if you did an agent of record and let nothing would change. Policy number changed. The premiums doesn't change, but we just become the servicing agency. That we do that a lot for people because we. Yeah. Control the home. Would that be possible? That I mean that would be a no brainer. Listen, I I can't I I wish I could give you a yes or no answer. That would definitely just be something that I'd have to talk with him about. Just because he's had a long-standing relationship with his current agent for the auto. I think that's probably what's keeping him there the most. Okay. Like I don't even know how long they've had that out or had that relationship together. Gotcha. Yeah, we. It's just. But I get it. I get it. Um. When you guys bundle, it's it's more of a discount. Yeah, and it's just more. It makes more sense for us to to have more than one. Yeah, for sure. But I don't, I don't mind. Shopping it, but that's just the mindset is. Normally we wouldn't shop it if we just had one policy, but if we had two, we would shop it typically on renewals. It's just. But I don't mind doing this one, but it's just kind of our mindset. Yeah, that's something we can definitely talk about. Like if we get this done, we can I can talk to him see if that's something he's willing to switch over. At this current moment. Would okay so like let's say later down the line like maybe a month or two from now, he does want to go ahead and do that. Is that something where like Let's see. How much acreage does he have? Like a half an acre, point two five. Oh, let me double check. I gotcha. I believe it is point three. Yeah, I believe we're on point three. Wow, looks like looks like this is better. But I need to do an analysis real quick here. If you don't mind, cat put you on hold right click. Sure. Is it going to take much longer? Take one more. Yeah, probably just a few more minutes. Okay, okay, yeah. Let me put you on hold right click. I do have to make a phone call. Like, okay, kind of right now, but it's just too long. Okay. Three twelve. I'm here. Okay, I'm here. Sorry about that. You're okay. Um. I found them. Um, the one that I, the only thing I could do if I don't have the auto. Is um. Hang on one second. Okay. I can um. I can't. This company won. It's it's a really good rate on the home. I have another offer. It's coming in at 858, but I have to do the auto. Or. I got another one that wasn't any better. Or I can change your deductibles around on the heritage policy. That. So 858. If I did, if I did the agent record on the auto. Um. Or I could change the deductibles around on his current policy to get it down. Or there's another quote I have with auto owners. It's not the greatest. I think that one. It's coming in about the same 1487. Um. Okay. So that's that's his really his three options. Gotcha. So the 858. That's if we switch over the auto to you guys. You'll be able to do that rate. Okay. 858. Actually. Hang on one second. Let me double check that. I think I get a little bit lower. And that's insurance at 312, 000. What thousand dollar deductible. Okay, across the board or just. Uh. Then I could give the. So his final rate would be. Hang on one second. 858. 809. It will be 809. Okay. Nothing change about the auto like everything will be the same. You just switch over to agency. Yeah, just the servicing agency changes. You know policy number stays the same, premiums stay the same. I don't change the policy. I really don't pick it up until the renewal date. So whenever that is. Actually, that's coming up here soon. Yeah. So we need to get that in. You have to sign an agent record. He'll have to sign an agent record form. I send that in to National General and then it takes a couple days to process. So the sooner the better on that. So. But I know your homeowner needs tomorrow. So. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, that's the one that I was really really focused on. So if we were able to do that, like like I have to ask him. But um, if we went that route and we did the. The auto. And the home together. Would the home be able to start tomorrow? Uh huh. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, cool. It's ready. Um. And the auto you guys just do that um. After. Yeah, we would just. I would submit that form you sign and let National General process it. It's pretty easy. I mean, we've been doing it for years. You just. It just changes over. I got you. And we just manage it from now on. For you. Okay, fair enough. Um. Yeah, let me let me talk to him and see if he wants to go that route. Um. What's a good contact number for you? You can just ask for Corbin. I kind of have a gatekeeper. Yeah. Corbin. Yeah. I do have a gatekeeper, so you just got to ask for me. Okay, fair enough. Fair enough. Corbin. And um, what what when do you guys or when do you leave this afternoon? Five. Five. Okay. Fair. Yeah. All right. And we've been. Yeah, I'll be in all day tomorrow. So. Perfect. Perfect. Alrighty, well, thank you. I appreciate that Corbin. I'm gonna um talk to some of what my dad and if he wants to do. If you don't mind, would you be able to send me like that quote via email? Yeah. Look over it. Yeah, let me open him. Final saying that. Yeah, I understand. And everything is relatively the same with um. Our current policy of heritage they kind of match Apple Scrapples. Yep. Well, I think you got a 1500 dollar deductible. This is a thousand dollar deductible. Okay. Uh, I think the other one was a thousand and then for Winden Hill is 2000. So. Yeah. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right
