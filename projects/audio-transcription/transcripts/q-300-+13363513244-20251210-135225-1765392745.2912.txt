Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hey, this is Lisa Tate. I texted. Well, I had y'all texted a paper for me yesterday to National General because I'd been paying insurance on a vehicle since last year and didn't realize it until the other day when I got my package in the mail about what I coverage I had and I noticed that I still had a vehicle on here that I turned the tag in last year and um I my daughter went to the tag place yesterday and got that paper for me showing when I turned the tag in and she had a monetary office to fax the paper to National General just to reimburse me for all these months I paid insurance on that vehicle. Okay, so if that was all done yesterday, it's going to take some time because that's backdating it a year. So it's not going to be an overnight change. This is actually probably going to take about two to three weeks for them to get this updated and refund the send out. Yeah, I was just wanting to know if he got that fax yesterday. I'll have to reach out to the monetary office because I don't work in that office. So I'll have to reach out to them and make sure. I called the National General line. I thought and it connected me to you guys. Yeah, because you have to go through your agent to make any changes or do anything on your policy. So you do have to call us first. And we make changes on the National General side. But I see the person that helped you out, so I'm going to reach out to her and see where she's at with this, and then she can give you a call back on everything. On an update. Okay, did that? Did they cancel the insurance on the vehicle I've been paying for because I need it canceled. That's what I'm saying. That is what's going to take about two to three weeks. Yeah. So for us to have proof and we have to turn it into National General for them to take it off because we physically can't. So it is going to take about two to three weeks for that process to happen. So it's going to take a little while for your policy to be updated for that vehicle to be taken off. Once everything is done, we will call and update you and let you know what the refund will be. Okay, all right, all right. Well, I appreciate your help. You have a good rest of the day. Thanks and you. Thanks. Bye. Bye.
