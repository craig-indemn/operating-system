I asked you to either call me or send it to my personal email. Yes, we are watching on that. We are trying to see if we can get you a quote from another carrier and see if that will help in the premium. So we are just yes we are just working on getting a few quotes and then I will communicate back to you before. Let's see. Um. So offices are closed on the first. So I should be able to get back to you on Friday. How does that sound? Okay, and you have my personal email address. Um, let me see what email address we have on file. Um, so we have one for Victoria Hawkins at Gmail dot com. Yeah. Correct. Will that be the right email to communicate? Yes. Okay, perfect. I will send you over an email with the quote we have, and then we can walk from there. Okay, thank you. Yeah, welcome. Anything else? Oh no, I'm great. Thank you.
