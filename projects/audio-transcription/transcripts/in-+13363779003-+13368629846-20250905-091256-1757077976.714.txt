Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hi, I just called a minute ago and nobody answered. But after deeper research, it looks like my insurance policy didn't renew. Okay, all right. Let me see. And it ended like two days ago. But I have nothing in my email or anything. Okay, so it looks like it's with National General. Yeah. Let me get it pulled up here. National General real fast. Okay, and what's your name? Ariel Cochran. All right. I just want to make sure I had the right policy pulled up here. Okay, so it looks like you had a renewal on September the third, and it looks like you're on paperless. Do you check your emails from National General? Yeah, I just checked and I've not seen anything. Okay, so yeah, can you make a payment today or you want to get this reinstated today? Yeah, it's what I was trying to do. I don't understand why it didn't. I mean, I pay it every month and this month I went in to go pay it and. Yeah, so all renewals like typically you get a grace period, but you don't on the renewals. Um, so that's that's what's different there. Um, so what I can do? Let me let me put you on hold just a second. Okay, let me see if I can get an agent on here, um, to help you get this policy reinstated. Okay, hold tight just a moment. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance Services.
