Brandy never called back and let me know anything. On your car insurance. Right because I I I realized the last week or the week that. I guess I don't know for the car dealer because I I got rid of the Mercedes and I bought a truck. And I realized I was driving with no policy. So I don't know if the car dealer never called. So we talked to the Brandy, and I don't know what she did. Yeah, I want to make it sure. Yes, he's got a note on here. We're we're taking off the Mercedes, putting on a 2025 Chevy Colorado. And you did it back in April. Yeah. Oh my god, Frank. Well, it's not my fault. I thought the car deal. You know they usually they always call it. I mean, I remember asking me the number for you guys. Actually, I even thought that they called in front of me. I can't say for sure. Oh well, next time just double check. Give me a call the next day. And say hey. Yeah, and that's the that's the first time because they usually it's not my first call. Yeah. Um. Yeah, so she submitted the request. And we're waiting. We're waiting on a reply from them to see exactly what they need for us to get this done for you. So Brandy will be in touch and letting you in letting you know.
