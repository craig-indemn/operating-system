Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Yeah, and what did you say your name was? Brandi. Okay, thanks. My name is Stuart Blanton, and I'm a customer y'all's. And I got a notice from my from. Auto owners insurance yesterday. It said my policy had was renewed, and so I was you know since I hadn't talked to y'all about it and also I didn't think it needed to be renewed till next month so I was. Just call them and see what's going on. Yeah, so the the notice that you received that's your renewal. It hasn't renewed yet. It's not going to renew without payment. But your auto policy renews November 30th and your home renews December 3rd. So they've probably just sent you out the renewal for both on what it's going to look like. Not that it's actually renewed. Now this you know since y'all have changed to Allianz but do y'all still get in touch with us and go over what's the best options? We have a team that goes through and looks at everyone's policy whenever it comes up for renewal 30 days out. If there is a need to move the policy, we will reach out and go over questions with you, or just review your policy itself. So we we do that 30 days prior to the renewal date. Okay, so that's that's that's I'm just a few days ahead of that so. I'll just follow back up with y'all in a week or two if I hadn't heard from you and we'll go from there. Yeah, I would first see someone reaching out to you around the end of next week possibly. To go over everything with you. We don't do it 30. We only do it 30 days prior because we can only quote if we have to move it. We can only quote 30 days prior to get an accurate quote for you. Oh yeah, I'm not I'm not in. Yeah, I'm not in a big hurry or anything. But when I got that notice, the way it's worded, it said it was it was recently renewed, and I was like, "Huh." Yeah, no, no policy is renewed unless it has unless it has payment. But the renewal has been released though, so that we have a chance to to look at it and you do as well. Okay, all right. Well, thank you so much for your time. Yeah, you're welcome. If you have any other questions, let us know. Okay. We'll do. Bye bye. Alright, bye.
