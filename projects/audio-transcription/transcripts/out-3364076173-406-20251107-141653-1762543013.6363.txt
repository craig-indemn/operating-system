Hey, this is Amanda von Redman. Leave me a message and I'll call you back. Good afternoon, Amanda. This is J Don with Lite Insurance Services. I was just calling to just review all the information we had on your policies for your auto and home. Whoever, because you're going to be coming up for renewal on both in January. We just want to make sure we have everything correct. Addresses, vehicles. If you would, just give us a call back at your convenience: three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thank you and have a great day.
