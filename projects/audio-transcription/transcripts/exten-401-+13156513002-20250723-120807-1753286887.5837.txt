Hello, this is Heather. Hi, Heather. This is Sandy Cozette calling from Yadkinville. How are you? Hey, I'm good. How's it going? Good. Okay, well I'm calling because insurance is almost going to be due and I got a notice about one of them. I think it was um. I think it was a house insurance, but I think it was Travelers. Okay. But I wanted and you told me to touch base in July to see if there was any way of consolidating them anymore. Yes. Yeah, we're gonna be. Yeah. We are gonna try this again. I think we did. We tried to bundle it in 2030. Yeah. And I have you. I actually have a little task for August 1st to reach out to you if I had not heard. So everything's still the same. Have you made any changes? Update to the home. No, no, nothing. Everything is the same. Yes. Let's see. Hold on one second. And that's the 2943 Leslie Lane. Right. Let's see. Um. What year is your home? Um, I moved in in October of 2003. That's when I moved down from New York and I didn't move until I moved in July, but I wasn't in it till October. Yes, okay, all right. There is a new home. It's still fairly new. Yep. Yes, so no, you shouldn't have had any changes. Then right, everything is still new. We're good. Okay, very good. Yes, but I think we've got a new carrier that bundles so. We are going to shop that for you. Okay. Okay. And so I will be back in touch. Let's see. Yeah, so I'm just looking here. Have you received your renewal? I got an email saying that it was going to almost going to be ready to be renewed. Okay. So it's 994. Yeah, 994 is your renewal. It's not until September the 6th though, but it it has been released. They just released that. So you. What are we talking about? Are we talking about the house or the um? The home, the house or. Okay, we're not talking about the car then. We're talking about the home. Yeah, we're going. We're going to quote price them together and try to bundle them as a package with the same carrier. But yes, so I'm looking at the house right now. It was 848. And it the renewal's 999. I'm 994. The renewal is for the house. The house. It was 848. Last year and then it went up to 994. Your renewal so it went up 146 dollars for the year. Oh, and that's Travelers. That's Travelers. Yes, ma'am. So it's nine. It went up 120 dollars. 146. Okay, well I paid in February. Okay, we're talking. I'm talking about two different things: 848. Okay, 994, and that's yearly, right? That's just one time. That's a year. Uh huh. Yep, an annual. Okay. All right, and then the auto. The auto is six months, so that's where we we need to. We need to get y'all as a six month policy and write a 12 month, and that's what I'm saying. I'm going to try and bundle everything. Okay, package. Okay. Yeah. Because your auto is really the homeowner looks. I mean, it's good. That's a good premium to be honest with you, Sandy. Okay, we have been seeing like significant increases with other carriers. I heard that. Yeah. Yes, so Travelers is still looking pretty good. Um, 146 dollar increase for the year, not bad at all compared to what we've been seeing. Okay. So I mean, we still have a homeowner's premium under 1000 dollars. That's pretty good. Yeah. So I would like to look at the auto though maybe we can combine it with Travelers like we keep your home with Travelers. Write your auto to Progressive. I mean, from Progressive to Travelers. And get that annual premium. So and then you would also get a discount on the homeowners which would make it bring that premium down a little bit on the homeowners. Okay, so I don't pay anything right yet till I hear from you. Do not pay anything. Yes, ma'am. Yeah. Okay, because then I need you to explain like some I've got written down here one of them just gets taken out of my checking account and another one I don't
