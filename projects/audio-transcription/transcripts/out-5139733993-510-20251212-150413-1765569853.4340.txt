Hello, you've reached Heather Circum, Personal Lines Underwriter for the Cincinnati Insurance Company. Unfortunately, I've missed your call. Please feel free to leave me a detailed voicemail or to send me a follow up email, and I will get to either one as soon as possible. Thank you, and have a nice day. Please leave a message after the tone. When you have finished, please hang up or press the pound key for more options. Hi Heather, it's Tracy calling from Alliance Insurance. I received cancellation downloads today on Chad Harrell. I need to find out if we'll be able to get that reinstated with the fire marshal's information. I'm also going to send you a quick email if you could let me know as soon as possible. I would really appreciate it. Thanks so much. Bye bye.
