Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. This is Jessica. Can help you. Jessica, this is Renee from Ortho Carolina. Calling you regarding. I think I left a message for you a couple days ago. Also, on Dillon Ricardo. Dillon Ricardo. He is employed by an Eric Mendez. No, he's employed by Eric Alvarez. Okay, I was out of the office for the past few days, but this morning looking through my voicemails, I called back. Maybe he's a manager. Of the the young man that was injured, but they hadn't been able to file a claim. And but today I gave him the number of where the employee needs to call to follow that claim claim to get a claim number. To get the ball rolling on that. Okay, okay, okay. Because for us to continue under work calm, the adjuster will need to complete an Ortho Carolina form. I mean, we can't just proceed with surgery until that's completed. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, okay. Doctor Biggerstaff was hoping to do this because the gentleman has a very bad fracture. To do this next week. Okay. Well, if he can get that call today, they'll probably assign an adjuster by the end of day tomorrow. By the end of day today, early tomorrow, then once they have that. I mean, it does seem what where we at Thursday Friday. Possibly like you could have that form completed by early to middle of next week, just depending on how fast. Because the customer, the the. And. Yeah. The boss of the employee will have to obviously communicate on what happened and the employee themselves. So in this type of industry, that this employee is in. Oh no, they'll have some. Yeah, neither one speak English. Yeah, okay, okay, okay. Speaks Spanish. That's an issue. But yeah, sometimes I will say these dollars. They one they um they take a good minute to report it and then two. Once the claim is filed, the communication between the adjuster and the employee or the employer is just like they. I don't know if they're procrastinating on it or what, but they don't get the information that over to the adjuster that needs to be given to them to. Move things along in a promptly manner. So I will say on his end if they. Take action really fast and they stay on top of things like this can be done. But if they're waiting to give a call back or if they don't answer after they've been called two times, like that's also the adjuster can only do so much. Oh I know, because let me tell you, they came in to our urgent care here. They walked into our urgent care. They didn't speak any English. It was it was hard to communicate. You know we have some. A way we can communicate with him, so he did see the patient, but then he had. A call is. He didn't have a phone number. He had someone else's number, so I found out that. The patient was working for someone. For another company. I mean it it it was it was difficult so I know it's going to take time. I know that. So okay, well, as long is there any way that you can put a note to to call me once this has started so I can talk to the adjuster. Yeah, what's your contact information? Okay, my name is Renee. And I am actually with Doctor Biggerstaff's office at Ortho Carolina. He will be doing the surgery. And my direct number is three three six. Six five nine four one zero five. And what's the um the patient's name? The patient's name is Dillon D I L A N. D I L A N Ricardo R I C A R D O. Oh, the last name. Is R I C A R D O. Oh, that was his last name. Do you need a date of birth? No, no, no. That's fine. That's his last name. That's what we have it. Okay. Okay. Already. Um. Once I have any of data details on that, I can get back with you. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you.
