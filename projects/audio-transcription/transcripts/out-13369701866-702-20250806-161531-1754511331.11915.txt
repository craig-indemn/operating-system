This is Dale. Dale, this is Rachel. Yeah. Allison just called me back. She has talked to Chub. And anyway, everything's good on your farm owners. You know, just come in before the twenty third and to make a payment. And you should get a bill from them. Just in case you don't, I'm going to dial it to call you to remind you. So, and I sent Jeff to get a quote on this contents and liability. On that building that you're leasing from Charlotte to Jeff Edmonds, and he should be calling you in a day or two. I'd be great. All right. Thank you, Dale. I'm sorry for the confusion. No problem. Thank you. Thank you, Rachel. Bye.
