Great data lines insurance. This is Jamie. Hi Jamie, how are you? Good, well, and I hope you are. Yeah, thank you. I am calling. We are existing policyholders already, and I was calling. We have a daughter who is hoping to pass her driver's test next week, but we need to get her added to the policy before she can take the test. Obviously. I can certainly hope you do that, and congratulations on this new chapter of life here. My phone system has pulled me into William and Jennifer Hyde. I might have mispronounced your last name. My name. I am apologizing to you. But five one four Dodson Mill Road in Piedmont, North Carolina is the mailing address. Correct. And let's see, that does pull me into an auto policy with auto owners. Thirty one. Let me get this thing open. Okay, so policy is active. Does she have a date? Just like an appointment schedule. She does. Her appointment is next Tuesday. No, yeah, next Tuesday. So January thirteenth at three fifteen. Okay, well I'll tell you what I am going to do. That I am going to add her effective the twelfth, just to be on the safe side. And I am going to add her to the policy as a rated driver. Now. The crummy part about this Jennifer is that it's she's going to go onto this policy as an inexperienced operator, and there is a surcharge that's going to follow for the next eight years. That is over eighteen. I don't know if that matters. Well, it just she's getting her driver's license for the first time. Correct. She just she she got stuck on a waiting list forever with behind the wheel because I don't know in Surrey County they had people later I don't know what happened so she finally she did it all and she was like the the upper like when she first turned seventeen and she finally finished behind the wheel and the classes in August and that and her birthday was in December so at that point we were like just let's wait. So it okay so full transparency with you complete honesty here. Historically, that surcharge was three years. North Carolina changed that auto law on July first of twenty twenty five. They changed a bunch of things about insurance and auto laws on July first of this past year, and one of the things that changed is the. Inexperienced operator surcharge, which usually affects kids coming up. Now in theory, it wouldn't make any difference if she was eighteen or if she was forty two getting her license for the first time because the insurance industry is going to view her as a brand new driver on the same interstate that you and I have been driving with all the same idiots that are out there driving. And it's true, right? So that's true. So but the reason I tell you that is because. Now the window for the inexperienced operator surcharge is eight years. I think that's going to probably get molded as time moves forward. Historically speaking, the most painful part of the up charge happened in the first three years and then typically when the kid turns you know somewhere around nineteen or twenty the rate comes down some and then it would fall again at like twenty five and then okay and then they're just a regular driver with mutual ratings so moving forward from here we don't know. All the details that how this is going to evolve as time goes on. What I think is going to happen and this is purely just Jamie's opinion. What I think is going to happen is that. The carriers in the state of North Carolina are going to figure out a way to let this trickle down some probably after year five or something. I think she's probably going to get a break in this rate. But I want you even you know family to know that it's unfortunately. That's out there and that changed and it stinks. Right. Okay. But yeah, okay. So let's get. Our older driver, our older driver is turning twenty one tomorrow. So I don't even know if it'll fall a little bit or not. Maybe not. It won't happen in the middle of the term unfortunately. Your your policy is going to renew on April eighteenth. I think you are probably talking about the Stella. Yes. It does show me that she's got two years driving experience right now. So when this thing comes around when this policy comes around for renewal on April eighteenth that's when it will reflect that third year of driving experience for her and then. Okay. And that will that will change some of the information. I see some of it because twenty twenty six is going to change also as far as Rick. They have the DOJ has not told us when they're going to bump it. They haven't told us how much, but there is a rate increase coming this year also. This past year there was a rate increase of seven and a half percent on all auto policies
