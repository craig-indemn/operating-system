Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, I was just on hold, and I think the call dropped. Okay. Um, what were you were you holding for? Homer Auto. I'm canceling my auto policy. Okay. Well, give me one moment, and I will try again for you. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Uh huh.
