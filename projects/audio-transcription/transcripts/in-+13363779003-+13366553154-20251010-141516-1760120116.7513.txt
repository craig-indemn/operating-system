You were trying to transfer me to Christopher. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is he available yet or? Um, I honestly I couldn't tell you yes or no because I'm not 100 sure. Did you leave my voicemail by any chance? No, ma'am. I didn't because it said there was a problem with a. Oh okay. Let me let me you might be able to assist me with one of the things I want. The reason I call, I've never talked to Christopher, never met him anything. I know he's my mother's agent now. On the insurance policy, y'all made some changes. I've always used Dirk before. Corbin. Yeah, Corbin. And. With all the politics and all, they anyway they transferred us to Christopher. But I need to get a copy of her insurance policy. Is due on November 1st, and they've not actually sent us a new copy of the insurance for this year. Can. Can somebody send that out to me, please? Yeah, of course. Um, yeah, I could help you with that. Um. Let's see. Uh, what is her name? Is it. Wilma Ames. H A N E S. Wilma and Jerry. What now? It's just Wilma. Yes. Okay. Uh, stepfather passed away in January, so. Sorry about that. So she wants the auto. Yes, ma'am. Okay. I like to have one sent out in the mail. We're not real good with computers. That's fine. I can mail it out. That's no problem. I left a message the other day for Holly to call me, but nobody I don't know if she didn't get the message or. Her name is Holly. Yeah. And also too, I mean, she is part time with that. Yeah, yeah, I realize it. But she she and Corbin told me that I could contact her with my particular policies. Oh okay. I don't know who's assigned to me, but but Christopher's signed to my mom's policy. Okay, all right. So I got that mailed out for you. Um, you should be getting the documents in from Progressive directly. Uh, was there anything else I can help you with? Uh no, ma'am. Uh, how come is Christopher out of the Clemens office? So he's normally out of the Pilot Mountain. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Okay. I see one of there's some confusion there. Who are the agents in Clemens' office now? In Clemens, it's um Corbin, Heather.
