Thank you for holding. This is Addison. Um yes, Addison, my name is Ellen Rucker, and I have my insurance. With you guys for my homeowners and my auto, and I had a question, one question, and then well a couple of questions, but. One is, I'm of course I know everybody's insurance is going up, but I found my premiums that I paid. Um for for 2024, but I cannot find can if there's a way you can look and see what my premiums were for last for this year 2025. Yes, I'm trying to see how much everything's gone up. Right, and it's gone up a lot. But that's from 2024. Mine's gone up almost 1400. Dollars, um, and I was just trying to see. If you can tell me what they were last year, what I paid. I usually pay for the whole year at one time, but I don't know what I'm going to do this year. Okay, let me take a look here. Can you confirm the address on your account for me? Um, my street address or I use a PO box, which one? Either one is totally fine. Oh, okay. I use PO box 1696 in Pilot Mountain, but my address is 201 Lester Trail. Pilot Mountain, 27041. Okay. Okay, we've got your homeowners with Pin National. Let me get you logged in here so I can pull up your records. Thank you. I think that's the same as my auto. Do they do both? Yes, your home and auto is Pin National. Yeah, okay. And then there's a renters policy with auto owners. Yeah, that's different. That's for my brother's where he lives. Okay. Okay, I'm pulling up all the invoices from your past policies. You said that you found which year. I've got what I paid in 2024, but I can't find the one for this year 2025. What I paid last January. Okay, the last one was 1557 for the home. Hang on. 1557 even. Yes, for the home. Okay. And what it um well. Sure, it takes a second to get on the computer. For the auto. Wow. Okay. And then for the auto, it was 134167. Okay, so the auto is what went up the most then. Um. Do you have a way of telling? Is that did I? I I did have a claim this past year, just in the past month or two. Um, on my car it wasn't like an accident, but I don't know how it got rated or whatever because it was I hit my garage door. Um backing out, when the tailgate was up, but anyway, um, is this any? Can you tell? Is some of this due to that or is it just? Did I get points for that like insurance points? So you wouldn't have gotten points for that, but it could definitely have something to do with it. Um, just a claim in general being on there. Okay. All right. Um, is it worth? Can do y'all ever look and shop around or not only if we ask you to or how does that work? You just. Yeah, we absolutely will if that is what you would like us to do. We've got your renewal coming up on the 14th, so we do have a little bit of time. And if you'll give me you know the holidays and everything, so if you'll give me a little bit of time, I can definitely shop around and see if we can find a better option for you. Okay, and what's your name, Addison? Addison, are you in the Pilot Mountain office? I'm not. I'm in the Walnut Cove office, but I bounce back and forth between Walnut Cove and Winston. But I will say I'm going to notate your account, so anybody that you talk to will be able to see everything that I'm doing and they'll be able to pick right back up if I'm not available. Okay. Well, that's good. Okay, should I you just were going to give me a call back next week or should I? Yeah. So yeah. Give me until sometime maybe middle of next week to get everything together because we work with over 20 carriers, so I want to run it with everybody to make sure that we're getting you the best that we can. Okay. And I'll email over the proposals first, so that way you can look over them and then I'll give you a call and we can talk about it. Okay. I appreciate this, Addison. Thank you so much. You've got my phone number and everything right. Yeah, I do,
