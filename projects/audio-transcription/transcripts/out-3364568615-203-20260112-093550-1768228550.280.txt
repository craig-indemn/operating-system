Hello. Hi, Lisa. Uh huh. This is Maria with Alliance Insurance Services. We had talked yeah we had talked a couple weeks back regarding getting an auto quote. I know you currently have it with Allstate. And we were going to quote it with auto owners to see if we can bring you some additional savings to both your auto and your home owners. We have that quote ready for you now. I don't um we quoted this. Let me get back over here. Because you had me put on an additional vehicle than what you have. I believe. The O seven Chevy Tahoe with full coverage no towing and rental. The nineteen Chevy Tahoe full coverage no towing and rental. Correct. Um. I think so yeah. I was going to try to pull up my policy here. Okay. It'll take me a minute. My laptop just. That's all right. I just turned it on so. It'll take me a minute. Oh, that's fine. I think we have your deductibles at one hundred on the comprehensive and five hundred on collision. I'm gonna pull up. One other one here while you're doing that. Okay. So I got it quoted with a couple actually. We quoted you with the auto owners. And hold on one second. You said that was a. Chevy Tahoe. Is that Chevy Tahoe four by four? Yes. Is it? Do you know if it's six cylinder or eight cylinder? Eight. Okay. They also have a boat. I forgot to tell you that. Yeah. We can definitely quote your boat as well. Because I was actually looking here. Yeah, I quoted you with both auto owners and progressive. Auto owners is would be packaged with your home owners, but I believe we got a better rate. Well, let me look here one second. We got a better rate. With progressive on the auto. Do y'all normally pay that monthly? Yeah, but it's it goes in a six month cycle. It renews every six months. Right. We this would actually be an annual one year locked in rate. For the year, if you paid in full, it would be eight hundred twenty three dollars. For the year. Wow. Does that bring you a good savings? What are you currently paying? For six months for both vehicles, it's nine seventy seven. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'd say that's pretty significant, and that's you know. Yeah, if everything's the same, you know. Yeah, absolutely. What I can do. I'm gonna send you. I'm gonna send you a copy of this. I'm gonna set it up. Would you let's see here automatically and pay that. There. I'm gonna send you the um what the villa um. Available plan is it's going to show you the monthly on that. I'm gonna email this over to you. That way you can take some time and compare it to the coverages you have right now. Yeah. And. When is your Allstate come up for renewal? May twelfth. May twelfth. Yeah, because right now it's from November to May. Yeah, well we can definitely look out rewriting it effective May twelfth. That way you don't have any mid time penalties if you try to cancel it, on May twelfth. But we can definitely line that up for you. This will give you an idea how much savings we can bring in and maybe worth the savings to start it now if you. If you wanted to, we can look into doing that. And of course, we can always quote your boat as well with progressive. They've got great rates for that. Okay. So I'm gonna. I'm gonna save this. And can I email this over? Let me see one second. Let me get up here. To c l m c c l i n t o c k nineteen seventy nine at gmail. Yeah. Okay. Let me email this over to you. I know you're trying to pull that up on your computer. Yeah, I've got it. Okay. Well, I can just go over those coverages with you if you like. Okay. Let me see here. We've got the liability limits at one hundred per person, three hundred per accident, one hundred thousand on property damage. Yeah, I've only got fifty thousand. Property damage. This is definitely giving you a whole lot more liability protection. And that's the same for your uninsured motorists that covers you in case they are not insured properly. That's also this quote includes a thousand dollar medical payments per person. You carry medical payments with yours. No, don't do that. That covers you. Covers injury to individuals riding in the vehicle regardless of who caused the accident. But bodily injury is that same thing. No, ma'am. This is medical payment. Transportation comprehensive. Including collision, personal effects, audio visual, bad electronics, auto collision, medical payment two thousand each. Okay, let me bump that to two thousand then per R two eight eight four six eight. Okay, and read back the top of the nineteen twenty nineteen to me again. One G, Nancy, S K, B K, D X K, R one eight one five three eight. Okay. Okay. All right, we got those updated. We matched the exact coverages you have in place. Of course, he did change it a little bit. The total premium for a year to match what you have in place is one thousand eighty-seven dollars, which is roughly about. If we set up on monthly, it'd be ninety-six dollars a month. You said you are currently paying what almost nine hundred right now for six months. It was over nine hundred. So this deal is going to be bringing you a good bit of savings. It's nine seventy-seven. For the year, the premium for the O seven Tahoe that I am getting is four fifty-seven. And then the premium for the nineteen Tahoe is four ninety for the year. And you have your fees, total premium. For a year, if he paid it full, it'd be one thousand eighty-seven dollars. You may send you a copy of this now that we've got everything lined up. Yeah, and this additional coverage is that included? It's automobile death indemnity insurance, ten thousand dollar benefits. So you have. Go ahead. Uninsured underinsured motorists. We do have the under and yeah the over unassured and underinsured coverage and we've got those limits at one hundred three hundred and one hundred. We don't. Yeah, we write that for any less. Yeah, we got it for a hundred here. And it's just all I am saying non applicable except for the property damage. And that's one hundred dollars deductible. That's what we have here. We don't this this policy does not carry that additional like life insurance dismemberment if something was to happen and we don't have that option with this. Right here, but like I said, I am going to email this over to you. Okay. And that way you can review it. And we can look into rewriting that if you decide you want to. I mean, what you can do because see there is typically a fee when you cancel mid term. It may be worth it for the savings that you are getting right now because I mean you are looking at. You said not even if it was just nine hundred for six months that's eighteen hundred dollars and we're at. I mean you are saving over seven hundred dollars a year. It may be worth it paying an additional fee to go ahead and rewrite it mid term in which we can do. Otherwise, and all you would have to do is just contact Allstate. Say if I cancel my policy right now, how much would I owe? To close it out today, and they'll tell you. Okay. They'll give you an idea how much it would you know because what you've paid in and so forth if you owed anything else and if it's not that much and I mean for the significant savings we can go ahead and rewrite this right now. Otherwise, we can definitely save this. And write it at your renewal in May. But go ahead. I am going to email this over to you. I want you to review it and then I'll follow back up with you either later this week or first of next week. To see if you've talked to Allstate and your husband to see what y'all decide y'all want to do. Okay, and then what about the boat? I just need to get the boat's VIN number. And what coverages you have in place on it right now, and we can get that quoted as well. Okay. It's a ninety six craft. Who did it? Craft craft. Ski notate. Okay. A nineteen ninety six. Do you have a VIN number for that or serial number? Let me get back to another one. Now let's go and tell you. Let's see here. Let me update this other quote. It don't have a VIN number on this policy. That's weird. Well, it doesn't. A boat doesn't have a VIN number. It has a serial number. Something else. I forget what it's called. I used to work at a bank and I forget what they're called for a boat. That would help me get the most accurate information when I punch that in. Yeah. And I don't really feel like digging that out right at the moment. You said it's a ninety six. What kind of craft? Correct craft. Correct craft. Correct craft. Okay. And what's the model? And it's a ski notate. Oh wait, I am sorry. E. Ski notate. Notate. Okay. N o u t i g e. How much coverage are you carrying on it? It's not showing me nothing. I don't understand that. You see, like a deductible. No, it doesn't.
