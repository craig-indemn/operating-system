Thank you for holding, Missus Donna. How can I help you? Hi, this is Jennifer with Warrior Metal Building. How was talking? I'll be sending the ID card over. I wasn't sure if there were any updates on that. We're still waiting for it to be approved by the carrier. Okay. Do you know more or less how long that takes? Um, it typically just depends on how long the underwriter reviews the request. I did follow it this morning, so I'm just waiting to hear back from them. But I'm hoping by the end of today. Okay, okay, perfect. Sounds good. Thank you so much. Yeah, you're welcome. Alright, bye bye.
