It's a great model life insurance. This is Jamie. Hey, this is a Preston out there. I'm trying to cancel my insurance policy with you guys. You need to cancel. Okay. Yep, my phone system has pulled me to Preston Grisanti 2016 Bromley Park Court in Winston Salem. Yeah. All right, let me get this thing open for you, Preston. All right, Preston, I do have an active policy for you with National General. It's got a 2016 Chevy Cruze over here. So to cancel this thing, I just need to make sure this done properly. Have you obtained other coverage? Did you sell this vehicle? No, the car's been the car's been repaid. The car got repaid. Okay. What date did it get repaid? Yesterday. Yesterday, okay. So I do have to have a paper trail to cancel this thing for you. I've got let's see, P R E S A L F 18 at gmail dot com shows up as your email address. Is that a good working email for you? Okay, that's correct. So what I'm going to do, Preston, is populate a form. I'm going to put yesterday's date on there. I'm going to send that to you for electronic signature. All right, it's going to show up in your inbox from Conga Son. That's C O N G A Conga Son. Make sure you click through it and then it's going to ask you to agree. You're going to click it and then scroll back up and and click complete signing. Once I've got that in hand, I can cancel this policy for you. If there's any leftover billing or anything, I'll screenshot that and email it to you. Outside of that, anything else I can help you with today? No, I mean so I just got assignments and I don't even have to be on the phone for you to cancel it. No, I legally speaking, you signed a piece of paper when you bought this policy. You also have to sign a piece of paper to cancel the policy. So no, no, you don't you don't have to hang on the phone. I certainly wouldn't keep you there, but I I do have to have a signed paper. Policy release form in order to cancel this thing. So I will send I will send it. Go ahead. I was going to say I'll send you this form and then and then once you click through it, it'll come back to me. I'm Jamie and then I I will process cancellation for you. And again, I don't know what the money's going to be. I don't think there'll be a balance on it, but I don't know and I won't know until I should click the button to cancel it. But once I have a balance that I know. Typically, when a like like your auto policy is tied to the DMV, so typically when a when an auto policy is canceled in the middle of the term, there's usually a balance that's left over. Now sometimes depending on the dates of coverage versus when it started, when it's getting canceled, sometimes it cancels clean. Usually, there's at least a few bucks or something left over on it, but I won't know any of that information until I physically click the button to cancel this thing. So once I once I've got all that for you, I will screenshot it, I'll email it to you, and if you need help from that point forward, give me a call back. But but I saw that yeah it's literally just a piece of paper you got to sign to cancel this thing. Okay, and let me ask you a question because it is the most this is the most painfully asking I've ever done with trying to get to one of you guys on the phone. Is there a faster way or easier way to get directly to one of you guys? I mean because I have to the the person to automate keep saying the same damn thing over and over and over and over and over again. I can't get to one of you guys. I don't even know how I got to one of you guys. So Preston, I'm sorry about that man. It is we are short staff this week. Half the office is sick. I'm personally sick. I'm working from home today. So I'm going to apologize for that. Normally there's a human that answers the phone. There's a service team that answers service phone calls, but it's it's the end of the year. We got people out on vacation. We also got people out sick, and so yeah, just going to lean into that. Apologize to you. Okay, you want to hang on the phone? You service again. I'll put you on hold. I'll put the service in. Yeah, we could that way. I can just make sure
