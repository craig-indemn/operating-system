Hey, Mister Doss, I don't know what happened there. I was I was saying I'm still here, I'm still here, and I couldn't hear anything, but anyway, I tell you what I need is I need to know the make of the trailer and I need a serial number on it if you've got that. Just a second, I got the title back in the mail the other day, and all of that will be on there. Just walked in the door. But adding this value of a trailer on there should not increase your insurance that much. Okay, I didn't well since you said what you did about it was covered liability wise. You just need to decide whether you want to put the the comp and collision on it. Yeah. Even even if you loan it to somebody else and let them use it, their truck or van or whatever's pulling it is the liability. Oh, okay. Liability always goes with with whatever's towing it. All right. Looking in the wrong pile. Here it is. All right, and what year model is it? It's a 2026. It was me. The vehicle identification number is seven P like in Paul K like in Kitty B like in Beth E like an elephant then one two one eight T like in Tommy one zero zero zero five six one one zero zero zero five six one
