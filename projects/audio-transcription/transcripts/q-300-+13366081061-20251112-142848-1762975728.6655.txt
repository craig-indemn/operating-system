Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hello. Uh, this is Daniel Basso. I need to get new home insurance. Okay, and can you verify your mailing address for me, please? Uh, two four nine Karen Circle, Winston Salem, North Carolina, two seven one zero five. Okay, so it looks like you were with Main Street America and that canceled, um, on ten twenty five. Um. So the company that we did um try to put you with, we will have to reach out to them and see if they will accept the lapse of insurance. Since ten twenty five. Yeah. And then we can get back to you on that. Okay. So how long do you think that will take? Um, I would say roughly a day, um, because we do have to reach out to underwriting and they have to review it. Okay. Yeah. So should I just call back tomorrow? No, we'll reach out to you whenever we've heard back from the underwriter. Um. Okay. We can go ahead and send them um an email now. Um, they close at four, so I'm sure that they won't get back to us today, on this. Um, so it'll probably be sometime tomorrow morning, hopefully. And then we'll reach out to you and let you know. Okay. All right. Is there anything else I can help you with? No, that's it. That sounds good. Okay. All right. Well, have you have a rest. Uh, good rest of your evening. You most definitely do the same. Thanks. Bye. Peace.
