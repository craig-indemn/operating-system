Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Hey Heather, this is Brian Grundy Worldline. How are you? Doing good. How are you? I'm doing all right. I'm by chance. Would you be able to email me that information? I have to send it over to my underwriter. So like having it on voicemail is kind of hard for me to correspond with my underwriter. Oh yeah, yeah, that's fun. Yeah and also we might need to have like a like a document signed by you guys to like you know merge the two, you know. Um. That I change the name. Yeah exactly yeah exactly so there might be a needed merger document as well. Um I'm just gonna you know work with my underwriter to see what is necessary at that point in time but if you can send me over the email there I'll try to see what I can do in regards to the situation. Okay. Do you think that we're going to be okay for this? Because I mean like the renewal is on the 14th. Of next month. No. Or this month. This month. Um you know again as as fast as we can get this information over. Okay. Um you know it shouldn't it shouldn't take. If everything was fine everything was all right it would only take 24 to 48 hours but there's an issue with this you know with with a lot that's going on here you know the numbers weren't right the you know the application didn't have a certificate and you know things were pushed by a little bit longer than expected so it's it really comes down to if we can get all the stuff done in a timely like an effective manner yes we can get this thing done quick but again I have to give it over to my underwriter we have to go back and forth at this point in time I got to speak with them real quick on the subject there I'll speak with a few people to see what I can do to try to speed up the process but I can't be 100 certain and also my system's down so. Happy Monday. Alright. Yeah I know so yeah let me see what I can do here for you but um again I'm trying my best here. Yeah I got you I just was wondering like if you guys would kick it because you know we're past that date at this point. Um. No we'll be able to get yeah we'll be able to help you know like get get you added to the policy do they make the payment for the renewal. I'm pretty sure that's already been done but I can't say for sure. Gotcha. That would be something that you could check once your system comes up but I'll email you on this and then if there is a a signature or something official that needs to be signed I can get that back to you today. Okay fantastic yeah I'll I'll try to see what I can do there for you. Okay thank you. No problem have a good day. Okay.
