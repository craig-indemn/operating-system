Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Tell me, I hope you. Hi, my name is Donette Sikes, and I'm with WinCare Solutions. And I just had a Workman's comp audit, and on that Workman's comp audit, they wanted us to change our class codes. So when I called Paychecks to get them to change the class codes, they said our policy had it written to be 8848, not the 8826 and 8824. That I had to get a new policy. So I wasn't sure where to begin with that. Can you help me with it? So if it's a new policy, I can definitely transfer you over to our team that can help you with that. But in the chance that no one does pick up because we have been a bit short staffed, there should be. Automated voicemail there where you can let them know what you need help with. If not, you can always send your request over to our email which is support at myallianceinsurance.com and either or should get back to you. But I can definitely transfer you over to try to get you into contact with an agent. Okay. No, appreciate it. Thank you. Give me one second.
