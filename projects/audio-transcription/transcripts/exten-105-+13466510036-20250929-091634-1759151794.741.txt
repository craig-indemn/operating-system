You got me. Hey Ricky there. Yeah man, sorry. Technology. No no. No, I'm good. Sorry, I missed you again there. No, I'm just getting settled in. Yeah, I know what time it is in Houston. It's okay. Yeah, yeah, well, hey, um, yeah, really, my my voicemail Friday last week. Yeah, so Brian had reached out. And he was just saying, you know, he was making me aware. So I my role at Covenant has I just I kind of oversee all of our broker relations. So sorry, we hadn't hadn't met before, but again, you know, appreciate you calling back and glad we can meet now. Yeah, he let me know that a claim payment was taken a while. And that that unfortunately for us right now, the just the accelerant having that week out has delayed a lot of our claims. And Brian was upset that we're taking the hit for it. Doesn't like that you know it's upsetting brokers in our end. So I don't know. I just wanted to quickly call and let you know that's why slowed down, but we put in the rush as we can on that one. Yeah. Appreciate it, man. I mean, listen, we we we understand that that you guys don't have much direct control once a claim gets out here like this, but you know we've been and we've been trying to work directly with this adjusting firm that accelerant has hired. I mean, I've been doing this a long time. I know how the game is played, but this particular adjusting firm, you know, this guy was ready to make the repairs three months ago. But they you know pulled this. Oh no, we got to have a structural engineer come out, and that just like stopped everything. It just has taken forever. So you know, and I'll tell you this if I need to be talking to Brian about it to give him the context that I would like him to understand and that's fine, but I'm I'm fine with you relating to him. But you know, we don't we don't we don't we haven't had very many issues with claims getting paid by accelerant. We haven't filed a ton, but you know the ones we've had have gone okay. This one has not. So whatever I can get from you guys to help move it forward. Great, it sounds like Brian's making an effort. I would just appreciate it being you know on high on his priority list. I mean, this thing's for 120 days, almost 130 days old at this point. So anyway, you know what I'm saying, and I'm not trying to book bust anybody's jobs over it. But I got to I got to help this insured somehow. And and if the adjuster is not going to call me back or the adjuster is going to send me, you know just the same exact response every time I email him. That is starting to quite frankly is starting to piss me off. It's like you know just go away and stop stop asking me about the schedule. You know so so that just that just that didn't happen in the last two weeks is my point. You know they've had some people out. I get it, but they hadn't been out for four months. Yeah, no, and you wouldn't be doing your job if you weren't falling up there. Yeah, I I can I can go talk to Brian again because he had just sent me a couple messages about it on Friday. Obviously, I'm not really I'm not aware of all the all the claims that occur, but I'm glad he brought this into my attention so we could at least briefly chat. And that was the only update he really was telling me to be sure to share. But I'll go I can go chat to him again and see if I get anything else. But the the least I can give you right now is that yes, it is very high on his priority list because that's all I'm asking. He can't answer him. He can't he can't get this guy a check today, but he can maybe get somebody's attention at at this at this claim for him. As guys look, you got to you know you got to quit stalling on this. So anyway, I appreciate the involvement there and the reply and and so now let's talk about the the fun stuff you wanted to talk about. I understand you might have some relationships. Yeah, yeah, we did. We do have we have some strong strong updates to the hotel program. So our current plan actually is starting in November. We've already got a new fronting carrier signed on. And we're just waiting on a little bit of reinsurance signatures, and that's all tracking very well for November first. So come November first, we will have. It's really kind of an increase in
