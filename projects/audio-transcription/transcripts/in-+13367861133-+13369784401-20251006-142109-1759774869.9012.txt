Thank you so much for calling, Insurance. Good afternoon. How are you doing? Good. How are you, sir? I am good. I am hoping that you could help me. My name is Ed Weiss, and I work for B T S Tire and Wheel. And I am working with Leroy Trent, who is at Firewater Service Center in Stuart, Virginia. And we are we are working to add the Goodyear program. To his business and the documents that we have been preparing and sent off to Goodyear, are asking for a certificate of insurance. So I was hoping you might be able to help me or direct me to somebody who can help me. I've got a sample attachment that I could email to somebody if that would be helpful. Do you have the policy number for the customer? I'm sorry now. Do you have the policy number for the customer? I do not give that to me, but I do have obviously Leroy, who's the owner. He gave me your all's name and number. The business is thirteen twenty nine scenic drive in Stuart, Virginia. Give me one second. No problem. And what was the name of the business? Firewater. Firewater is Firewater Transport, LLC or Firewater Service Center. I got it. Give me one second more. And I almost have everything for him. No problem. Appreciate you taking my call. Of course.
