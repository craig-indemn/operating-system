Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Oh yes, this is Mister Hakeem. I spoke with you earlier. Yes. Yes, I just went to my mailbox and I had remember I called about renewing my insurance. Yes. And you said something about sending me an email, but I just received in the mail renewal. Okay. Yeah. So. Yeah, I told you that we were going to look at National General. Um, but I haven't sent anything yet because I haven't had a chance to look at it yet. No, but what I'm explaining to you is I just went to my mailbox to check my mail and I have a renewal policy right here that they sent me. With uh insurance cards and everything. Right, so your auto policy is renewing October 19th, but since the rate went so high, we're going to look at another company. Okay, so I don't understand what what was it what what was the what was the rate because they sent it say here effective day 1019 expiration day 101926. So they took it apart in itself to just renew the whole policy without informing me of what I'm going to be paying monthly. That's what you just got today. They send it out before your renewal, so that way you have a chance to look at it. Okay, I'm looking at it, but it doesn't say, uh, it doesn't have anything here to what my monthly payment would be every month. So that would be on the declarations page and the billing page. I'm sitting here looking through all of this. That's why I call because I don't see anything there for that. So your policy increased about 68 dollars monthly. So whatever you're paying now it's 68 dollars more than that. But we are looking to see so it won't matter. Like. So if we move it, then you're not going to be with Utica, but we have to look and see with National General how much it's going to be. Yeah, okay, because why why would it go up so much? That's what's saying I haven't had a chance to look at the history on your policy. I don't know why it went up. I haven't had a chance to look at it yet. So we look into the reasons why it went up, and then I'm going to look at National General to see if that's if that's a better rate. With the same coverages that you currently have. Okay, because I'm because it's up. My insurance is up Friday. No sir, it's not your insurance is up on October 19th. We're in September. Okay, okay. So you have a month. You have a month before your policy renews. Okay, well, all right. I wait for you to get back to me because I've not paid no no. I've never had any any tickets or anything like that. I'm not going to go 68 dollars for what I was paying 103 dollars. So now they're telling me I was going to be paying 170 dollars. For for no reason. Well, it's not for no reason. North Carolina did have a rate increase, so that comes from North Carolina itself. But I cannot tell you the exact reason why your policy went up without even looking at it. So I have to have a few days to look at it, and then I'll get back to you to see what we need to do from there. Yeah, but you have you have a month, so the renewal documents that you got in the mail today. They send those out a month in advance for you to look at. Okay, all right. We get that we we get that at the same time as you do, so we don't get anything sooner than you. Okay, all right. I just asked you about the rate because I don't see anything here saying what it went up to. Yeah, it'll be in those documents because they can't send it without telling you how much you're going to pay. It's on one of those pieces of paper. But like I said, we're going to look into it. We're probably going to end up moving you to National General. But I have to quote it and look at that. So I'll probably be in touch with you by Friday. Yes, okay, all right. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Have a good day. You as well. Thanks. Bye.
