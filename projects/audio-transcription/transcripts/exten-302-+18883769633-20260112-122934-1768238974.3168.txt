Do you want to do a down payment with nine monthly payments left? Um, he was going to do a down payment, and then but is that that gets direct bill correct? Uh, yeah, it is direct bill. But what I would do after we get this, bind it or bound today. I have a number for you to call which is called AY Direct Bill and from there you're able to set it up if you wanted to have it automatically deduct it from your insured's credit card so it's like an automatic payment almost.

So today with a down payment will be one hundred thirty five dollars and eighteen cents. Every installment after that will be seventy seven dollars for thirty four cents and a three percent convenience will be added. Okay, so that payment has to be taken today for just to start. Uh, for it to be bound, yes. Okay. Um. I don't have payment information. Okay. Okay. Can we three way him in real quick? Sure. Yeah. Just because I don't want to have any more issues and that way we can go ahead and get it paid. Yeah, or if anything he could just send you a picture of his card he or she. Okay, let me.
