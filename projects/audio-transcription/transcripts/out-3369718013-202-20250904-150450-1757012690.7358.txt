Hello. Hey Hank, it's Heather with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm fine, Heather. How are you? Doing good. Really really bad storm. Yeah, well I was calling. It looks like two payments were issued. Two days ago, so I just wanted to give you the heads up, and for you to be on the lookout for that because they're being mailed to you, okay. Somebody called last week, Friday I believe, and said somebody from Ottawa. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, all right. Well I just wanted to touch base with you so if you do need anything let us know. I will. I'm getting trees. Not I've been having trees cut down including the one, one on the house finished cutting down and. And now they finally got back here today and they average about two days a week. I got. I'm just having much more cut down as a precaution. All right. Well, thank you, Hank. Have a wonderful day. Thank you, you too. Bye.
