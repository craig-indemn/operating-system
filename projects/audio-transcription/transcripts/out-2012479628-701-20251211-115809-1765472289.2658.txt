Hello, hey there, Greg. This is Jeremy at Alliance Insurance. Hey, I want. Hey, Jeremy, what's going on? I'm good. I'm good. Sorry, we've been playing such a game of round robin here, trying to get in touch with one another. Not a problem. We've just been extremely busy. Understand. So I will send you an email and send you the deck pages from everything that we've got. Okay. Right now we've got our homeowners with Heritage out of Florida, I guess. And we have jewelry with Jewelers Mutual, very happy with them. And then we have our auto with National General. Okay. And premiums are good, but the services aren't so hot. We did we had a little bang up over the summer, Lori got to relax and they were horrible to deal with. But but what else is there? Let's see, we have. I think I covered it. I think that's it, right? No, no, one we have a we have a condo in New Jersey up in Cape May County. And I've got a policy there. It's a dwelling policy with New Jersey manufacturers. And we we had when we lived in New Jersey, we had everything bundled with them, and they were they are an outstanding company. I'd put them right up there with Amica Mutual. I don't know if you know that company, but they're they're also an outstanding company. Very very very good people to work with, and so we had you know both autos and both homes and we owned a home in North Jersey and we owned the condo down in Cape May County with them. They were excellent. But when we moved from New Jersey to North Carolina, they wouldn't give us an HO six. So as you said, you're not a resident of the state anymore, so we can't give you an HO six. And it's you're you're out of state and it's a second home. So they put us on a dwelling policy which premiums like three times what it was at the time we had an HO six. I don't understand that, but I'm not in the insurance business. So anyway, that's a story. Okay. And so it's just Lori and I. We're both both Lori's 68, I'm 75. So we you know we've got. We've got that working against us or for us. I don't know which. I guess it depends on which level of insurance you're looking at. Right, right, right. Absolutely. Okay, so I tell you what. So I got to you know I'll be talking to Steve about the I guess I'll be talking to Steve about the Medicare supplement plans. As well as our as well as our prescription plan D, that's something I guess he handles right. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yeah, 100. All right. Whenever you email me if you would, Greg, would you put your driver's license number and date of birth in that email and Lori's as well. Sure, I can do that. Yep. And then that should give me enough basis to get everything kind of going. And then if I have questions, I'll reach out to you here directly, sir. All right, good. So at this point, at this point we've we've renewed with National General. That's that's my that's the biggest thorn in our side at the moment, primarily because of the accident. Our premiums went from our premiums for for both vehicles went from like a little under 2100 now to almost 3600. For the year, so what I did was I signed up for a financing program where I'm paying monthly. That gives me the option to bail out mid year next year once we pass the anniversary date of the accident. We'll hope hopefully our premiums would drop. And if so, then we'll cancel that policy and go with something else. Okay. I don't think you're going to find. I'm pretty pretty sure you're not going to find anything better than that right now. We we kind of shopped it ourselves and had the broker that we were working with shop it. And National General is still in the lead as far as the premiums go. So and there's it's tough to bundle because we're you know we're coastal down here, so it's tough to do that. You may run into that too. Okay. I mean we're we're not right on the ocean here in North Carolina, but we're we are in a town called Leland, which is just south of Wilmington and we're about 20 20 25 miles from the ocean. Okay. Not in a flood zone, but you know coastal coastal in North Carolina, southeast North Carolina. I guess they worry about hurricanes. Yes, sir. Stuff like that. So yes, sir. Anyhow, I'll
