Sorry for your hold. This is Cody. May help you. Hey Cody, this is George. Hey, how are you, sir? I'm doing just fine. I'm sorry it took me so long to get back to you. Oh, no problem. Um, just a second here, George. Okay. You have a good Christmas. Yeah, well, I'm still on vacation. I'll be back between 25 26. Oh, I got you. Yes, yes. Sorry, I'm over here in Mexico right now. Yeah, in Mexico, you said. Yeah, yeah, I'll be back. Have a good visit with your family. Oh yeah, yeah, we're we're visiting everybody both sides. Good deal. Yes. Um. Just a second here. Um. So Westfield is just asking about payroll and employee count for the renewal. Yes. Because I think on your current policies, we have like, I know the current workers' comp has like 210, 000 in payroll. Yeah. Yeah. Um. So how much helpers are you running? Two. Okay. How much are these guys making each then? Uh, right now they're making roughly about 12 to 1400. Every week. Yes. Okay. So by the 1300 times 52, it's about 65 70, 000 a year, plus you're included, correct. Yes. Yes. Okay. So two, I'm just going to put two at how about 70, 000 each. So that's. About how much? 70, 000 each a year. Yeah, that's roughly because sometimes at the end of the day, I pretty much give them the same thing. You know, even if they they don't know as much as as much as other ones, but I pretty much give them the same thing. Okay. Plus you being included. Okay. I'm sorry if I lose you here. Uh, there's a the signal is in it now. No problem. Um, they did ask about a return to work program, which is what a lot of workers' comp policies and companies they ask about. That basically means if one of your guys gets hurt, do you have like a a plan for them to get back to work? Which usually in with carport stores that they don't have that that's a larger organization type of a thing. Yeah, yes. So what I normally do is I just have you opt in to what they have something called West Works. Okay. So they work. If you have a workers' comp plan, they work with you and your employees to try to get them back into workings in some capacity faster. Which obviously limits the amount of money that they have to pay out, right? Um. So I'll just inform them you don't have one. You'll opt into their you know West Works. Okay. Now let me ask you the payment that's pending already. Is there any way you can postpone that or is it already too late? You can't postpone payments. You know, like when like when COVID happened, you know there was like some forgiveness on like payments and stuff like that. But in just any normal situation in times like there's no postponements of payments. Okay. Let me. Yeah, okay. I tried to log in my online banking account. Um, but it kicked me out, and so I just pull it up here and see when it's supposed to draft. I think it already drafted. Oh, it did. Yeah. Yeah, it showed up. It showed up about two days ago, and I started logging in early in the morning, but they were just kicking me out. So I don't know what's going on. I got you. One of the bacon. I was just going to pull it up real quick just to take a look. It's taken a sweet time here.
