Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Ah yes, it's Thurmond Porter. I need to speak to someone about my personal auto insurance. What kind of questions did you have? Maybe I can help. Well, I've got some letters here from the state of North Carolina from stuff that was supposed to be taken care of as far back as October and November. Okay. And also, I got a bill from Progressive saying that I owe them two hundred ninety-one dollars and someone looked at this yesterday and said I don't owe them, but I'm still getting emails and stuff like this so. You know somebody's dropping a ball here. Let's let's pick it up and run with it. Yeah, all right. Well, let me get to an agent that can help with that. Appreciate it. Mhm.
