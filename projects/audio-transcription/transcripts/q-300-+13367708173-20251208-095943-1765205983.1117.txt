It's a great morning, alliance insurance. This is Jamie. Hi, yeah, I just wanted to add somebody to my car insurance. Okay, yeah, I think we do that. What's your name? Bunny B U N and I Bulls the O L E S. O L E S. Yes. All right, my phone system pulled me into three two zero Glenbeir Drive apartment. I and what's the seven in Carolina. No, um, I recently changed my address. Um, I called a little bit ago and I changed my address whenever um my insurance got renewed. And they added on that fee and everything for changing locations. Okay, well that that might be updated here. This might be old information. I am looking at. Give me one. Let me get this policy up and live, and I will I will fix this. That's a. That's a manual entry thing for us. So. Okay, no worries. Yep. Okay, bunny. I did find an active policy with National General one five two zero Runabout Road in Littlefield, Carolina two seven zero four zero is the. And the address it shows up there on that. Is that accurate for you? Yeah, that one's good. Okay, okay. So the the old Glenbeir that that's just an age hasn't touched that to move it and get it out. This is I am going to fix that for you. That is not a problem. Okay, so currently on here I've got you as the only driver of a twenty seventeen Chevy Cruz. Who are we adding to your policy? Um, my boyfriend we he moved in with me and he doesn't currently have a car so I want him to be able to drive my vehicle. Okay. While this thing is loading here, I am going to ask you: Do you have boyfriend's date of birth and driver's license information? Yes, yes I do. All right, good deal. All right, what is boyfriend's first name? Bishop. Middle initial. L. And his last name. Anderson. And what's his date of birth? Oh six two zero two thousand two. Okay. Had a very late break so. So I know we talked about it before, but where are these connectors going? Does he have a valid driver's license at this time? Yes, yes he does. Do you? Still kind of loose with the bracket. And what state is this driver's license from? North Carolina. You can try. Perfect. Okay, go ahead with his driver's license number. Give me one second. Yeah, I don't know if I've acquired that ability yet. That's great. You tell him. Okay, are you ready? I am ready. It's zero zero zero four two three four two eight three zero. So zero zero zero four two three four two eight three zero. Yep. All right. Well, I know you had good idea. Yeah, I helped you do it. No, I have. I don't know. I can't see what I am fucking doing. You got to see where the stud is and go at it on the other side. All right, my head's tight. What's there over here Thursday? Oh, man. All right, any other changes going to take place while I am messing with the thing here or? Um no, but I just did have a question. Um. So the last time I called and I renewed my policy, um, I went ahead and paid for my car insurance, but they hadn't renewed my policy yet or added on my extra year of experience. Um, so they had to refund me about nineteen dollars, but the total I paid was three fifteen three hundred fifteen dollars and my. New balance is two thirty, so I was wondering why I didn't get that eighty dollars back and I only got twenty dollars back. All right, that is a good question. Let me let me get through adding Bishop here because I can't see. I can't see everything yet. I do see here. It looks like you talked to Brandy. And updated. Let's see. In September, we removed a two thousand two Audi and then we updated your address. And made on ten twenty seven updated driving year to you. I am going to go ahead and. Let's go ahead and take care of getting Bishop out here. No, I. Okay, no problem. I ain't trying to get that in. Yeah, he said, "Man, we can ask all the questions you want, and I am good with you." I am just here, so I won't be a problem. All right. It looks like adding Bishop is going to add eighty one dollars to the policy. You do have an annual policy, bunny. It renewed November twenty seventh. It's going to run until November twenty six. It's currently showing me adding eighty one dollars for that whole year. Two thirty eight eighty and showing me the next payment. All right No, bishop is on there. Okay, yeah. So your monthly payment now is two. You got two thirty-eight eighty. That's going to come due on December twenty-seventh. Okay, and then and then looking from forward from there, it's two thirty-eight seventy-six. So. What I think happened here, based on again backwards looking information, you had two vehicles on this policy. When you took one of them off, the system recalculated everything, and it put additional premium on that single vehicle. And it bumped up the cost of insuring you and that vehicle. Essentially, the way that that and that's that's a that's a frustrating thing that happened there. And I'll be honest with you, buddy. I can't fully explain why carriers do that. But the way they look at us as drivers, right? Like I'm Jamie, I'm a real human, right? I drive down the road too. If I've got two vehicles in my house and and I'm the only driver in my, so if it was just me and I had two vehicles, the insured carriers look at me as risk. Oh, that's why. And the total cost of my risk, you know how likely is Jamie to get in an accident if he has two vehicles? Well, that's fifty percent of time in vehicle one and fifty percent of time in vehicle two, right? So when so when I when I sell vehicle two, that puts all of my driving risk on just this single vehicle. And the odds of me crashing that vehicle, it obviously increases by fifty percent there. Based on the cost of that repair or replacement of that single vehicle, that cost in general. It all washes through the system. You do currently have, I guess. If there is light at the end of this tunnel here, looking at your information, you currently have. I've got your date of birth is ten two two thousand three. Currently have two years driving experience for this policy here. Bishop has seven years, and then looking at driver history. It shows up in your information. Does there chart any points here for and bishop is also clean. So the one closest to us, right? Policy, buddy, is going to renew again on November twenty-seventh of twenty twenty-six. Because their date of birth being October second. When this thing comes around for renewal again on November in November of this year, you should pick up another year of driving experience for you. In theory, it should you know, right? You got to stay clean, right? If you pick up an accident, speeding ticket, or something that would cut it all off. But if you if you and bishop stay clean in this driving, right, for you, for your year of driving experience. I didn't have. Gotcha. Whenever I did all that, and I believe it was September with the address and everything, and then that's when it was three fifteen. Whenever I sold my other car and got a new one, that's when it was three fifteen, and then when they added my new year of experience to it, that's when it went down to two thirty. So I guess I'm just kind of confused as to why for that one month I went ahead and paid it. Basically, they were processing my extra year, but they didn't put it in the system yet. It wasn't finished processing, so I still paid that full three fifteen, even though my bill was only about to be two thirty. So I guess I'm just confused as to where that sixty dollars difference went. Even though at this point the multi car discount and everything that's already been taken off and affected to my account and everything, so I guess I'm just a little bit confused about that difference still. Well, gosh, that's a really hard answer to to to be able. I really don't know. I really don't know, buddy, because this thing is a computer system that recalculates. The beauty and the curse of the insurance industry right now is that everything is data driven. And that everything is a computer system that manages the billing, right? So let's say you went and bought a new vehicle today, and I put that information in there. It's going to recalculate the cost of insuring those vehicles today. It would affect your Chevy Cruze. It would affect the new vehicle. And also just talking that the the address change, that also affected the cost of your insurance. For example, where you park your vehicle, that's coming to Roger address. It's absolutely a factor in rating for vehicles. For example, I live in Charlotte, North Carolina. I'm in Mclemore County. My mom is back home in Mount Airy, North Carolina, Surrey County. And you know, looking at a population density, there's way more people in Charlotte than there is Surrey County, North Carolina. So there's more people on the highway. There's more crime. There's more exposure
