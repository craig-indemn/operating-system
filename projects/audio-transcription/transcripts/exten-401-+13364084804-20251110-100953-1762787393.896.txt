Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Hey Heather, how are you? This is Tomas Figueroa. Hey Tomas, how are you? Doing good, doing good. I have a request or something I need for you to do if you could help me. Okay. On the homeowner's insurance policy, I'll just forward you an email from Fulmain. I'm gonna I'm kind of redoing that. I had a home equity line with them. I kind of refinancing it with them, so they want me to add them to the deck page. So basically, what I want to do is remove. The old one, and put this new one. It has a loan number in there. Okay. Yeah. As the as the lien holder. Yes. And they wanted like a PDF showing that so I can schedule the closing or something like that. Okay, all right. Are you able to email me that? Can you forward it? Yeah, yeah, I just sent it to you. See if you got it. Oh, you did. Okay, perfect. I did. I sent it from a person. Some person without half for years because they email me through there. So I just so no regular email normally seeing. I just forwarded to you, but but yeah, just whenever you get it, if you know not there. I sure will, hon. I'll go ahead and send it to the lady, but that's all I need. Okay, now this is um. Is this for a home equity line? This will be a second mortgage. A second. Right, I'm refinancing it to a second mortgage and not a home equity line anymore because it moves around so much with their. It does. And all that so. Yes. I'm kind of making a little. So this will be your second mortgage then. Correct. Yeah. Okay. Very good. Yeah, that's all I need right there. So I will get that taken care of. Everything else going good. Yeah, everything else is good. No issues. Yeah, Cincinnati is Cincinnati. I know it's like holding their breath right. Oh my goodness. I don't want to stay out of any claims. You know I don't want to follow anything. Oh god, I know. I don't know unless something major happens. I don't want to follow it because. You know the way they are now. They're very picky about things. You know so. Oh, they are. They really are. I mean, you know that. And then like, but the you got your valve installed and that went smooth right. You went through. Yeah. That was good. That worked out good, but that's the only way. If you've had a water claim, I was just telling another guy just called in and he had one in 2023. And he's with Allstate now, and so I'm trying to get him quoted. But I said, you know, I've got one carrier like Cincinnati is willing to take it on. Because I think his was like forty thousand. That claim was which was litigated so they got it all back, but still it just you know they're going to ask. But I'm like, if you're willing to install a automatic shut off valve, that's the way Heather will do it. You know if it is a claim, a water claim recently that's that big a large of amount. You know she's like, well, if they want to install that water shut off valve, she's willing to take the risk. So at least we have that option. You know instead of just a hard no. You know, like most carriers, they're like, nope, nope. Oh god. Did you have to send that information to them from um? That I when I replaced the valve because I never sent. I did. I just sent it to you. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I take care of it. Yeah, it's good, it's good. And then she was okay with the pool too. You know since it's out, it's not you don't have any neighbors. You know she's fine with that too. So Cincinnati's a great company. You know I like them a lot. They're willing to to kind of work with me on some things. Now some things they're not, but you know at least I I know I can go to her name Heather too or underwriter with Cincinnati. So I can actually at least she'll let me explain something. You know and be like, this is why we need to insure. Sometimes she don't agree, but you know, not that she don't agree. She's just like some things her hands are kind of tied on too. So yeah, yeah. I mean everything's good. Even the car insurance and all that seems to be good. So I don't. No issues. Stay out
