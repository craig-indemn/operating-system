I am I am at the at where this address is and the address is a wooded lot. There's no home at this address. And you can you can confirm that by googling this address on the internet. And you'll see a vacant lot. This the address is 11 Mount Vista Drive, lot 11. That's right. Yeah. Are you insuring just a vacant lot? No sir, it should be new construction. Well. He told me it was completed. Well, I'll tell you this. This address is 11 Mount Vista Drive. The first house on the street. Is address 49. So right beside it is a is a lot that has no no. Dwelling built on. Let's see. You know you let me. I may be getting him confused with another. I wrote another one up that way that was new construction. But let me let me reach out to Bob. And I, what's your number, man? How can I get back in touch with you? Okay, it's it's five four zero. Three zero nine two five zero two. And my name is Bob Grumfield. Now this this is kind of off the beaten path where this is and. I can wait a few minutes, but I can't wait very long. Otherwise, I'll just have to close this inspection out. Unless you want me to just take a picture of the vacant lot, I'd be glad to do that. No, no, I will. I will be right back in touch with you. I'm going to reach out to him. Okay. Sorry, sorry.

Hey Bob, it's Heather. I could not get him. I left a voicemail. However, I pulled up the pictures on Zillow, just trying to refresh my memory about this. And I want to say the address is incorrect. I mean, it's listed that way. But it. I think it's the house across the street from that lot. Do you see a home across the street? I'm sorry, I'm losing you. What'd you say? Bob. Hello. Yes, you hear me now. Yeah, yeah, I know you're out there. Okay. Yeah, I can remember him telling me something. So yeah, unfortunately, where'd you go? I have to wait on him. But give me a call back. Is it possible he can do a self inspection if you can't go back out there? If what I know they, I know they started doing self inspection. So I guess that's an option. If you if you're not able to get back out there. Yeah, okay, I would would not be able to. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, I'm right here at the beginning of this street. Mount Vista Drive. I'm at at the beginning of it, and it intersects with another street which is called Holiday Lane. But anyway, if if it were on if it were actually if it was actually address 11. It would it should be the first house on the street because the next house is 49. So I don't know what else to. There's no new houses being built here. Yeah, no, and I apologize. I I was using him with another Bob I was working with, but. Let me hold on one second. See what I can pull. Yeah, I couldn't reach him either. I left him a voicemail. He's in Ohio, I think. Right. Yes, sir. Yeah, this is his secondary resident. And that
