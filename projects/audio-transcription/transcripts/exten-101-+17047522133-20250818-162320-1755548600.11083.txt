Thanks for patient holding. This is Amani speaking. Amani, this is Claudia from Westfield. How are you? I'm doing good. How you doing? I'm doing well. Hey, I was calling you on Warrior Metal Buildings LLC. You had sent me an email to see if I had look, reviewed this or anything. Yeah. Let me see if I if I understand. Mega Metals LLC was the one that canceled for non pay. Correct. That we wouldn't reinstate. Yes. Okay. Now are they doing the same thing as carport installation? Is that what they're doing? Yes, they're doing the same thing. Okay. Because what the class code we normally use for what we've been using is 98502 and when I looked at your quote the reason why it flagged it is because we were doing building manufacturing. Oh okay. And that's why. Why it was because I was like, okay, it can't be doing carport installation because some I couldn't understand why the the why it was. So high as far as authority, like something isn't correct. So. I'm going to fix that on my side. But the other thing, I wouldn't. I wouldn't ask the new owner to pay somebody else's bill. If it is he, the new owner was part of the crew that was on Mega Metals LLC. Correct. So you know we're. Okay. You know we're making sure everything is trued up and you know right before we say hey we're going to write a new policy for you guys knowing that you know you were associated with that with that company. Okay. Okay. And so the only thing on this we wouldn't be able to do the property because of the age of the building so I'd have to take the property off but I'm going to go ahead and fix. The class code and all of that and treat it as a new. Yeah, we have it as 2025. Okay. Let me go ahead and fix the class codes and all of that and I will get this back over to you and if you want to make the new owner pay the other rest then I mean that's fine with me. If you want them to do that, I'm not going to require that because he wasn't the owner. Yeah. We just want to show you know good faith that we we want to do this because we don't want to write people that's going to cancel it and you know just leave a bill hanging like we don't want to write this like okay. Yeah. So okay, I appreciate it. All right, I'll go ahead and get this fixed up and then get it back over to you. Okay, all right. You have. All right. You too. Bye bye.
