Thank you for holding this, is Brandy. How can I help you? Hey, she thought she was going to be putting me in a voicemail, but I got you anyway. And I'm hoping maybe. Sorry, hold on real quick. Just got that in my throat, and she answered. Hopefully you've been talking to Audrey. She was canceling, and I'm picking up for a mobile home. In Lot 39 in Chapelle Estates. Is that ringing a bell at all? Yes, you were in. Yes, yes. Yes. If you can, I can. See, I can email you and you can send me all the information as far as. Are y'all going to have a contract on the rent to own? Well, no, we're not even doing that. Okay. And she called and talked to somebody today. Okay, hold on. And canceled like she incents they they've already canceled her. And then I'm supposed to be picking it up like they canceled her today. Okay, let me see. So she talked to somebody literally today, like probably not that long ago. And I and I texted her and I said, "Well, who did you talk to?" But she didn't text me back. So I was hoping that I could find out who she talked to. Okay, give me one second. No, you're fine. Where are you going, Bodie? Sorry, I'm sitting here messing with my grandson too. If you want to close that door, you can. Okay. Okay, and what is the address again? The address. Oh, hold on real quick. I left that out on the table. Oh, no. I should have brought that in here with me, but I didn't. It is. 1646 Chardell Drive, Unit 39. Okay. All right, so what I'll do is I'm going to try to get you a quote today. Because if she canceled today. Actually, she's got it canceling. 16. Yeah. Yeah, that's what it was supposed to be. Okay. So. Yeah. Okay, so that's whenever we will start your policy. Okay. Thank goodness because that gives us enough time. Okay. Yeah, that's what I was supposed to be, and then she was like, "I don't know anyway." All right, so we'll work on this, and then what I'll do is I'll email you over a quote and then we can set a time and date to go over and talk about it. Okay. And I will try to get that to you by the end of the week. All right, and now the other thing. And since it's kind of not a renter thing anymore, but I still do have stuff in storage, so do I need to add like a policy for that too, or you know what I'm saying? So you will have like a 10% coverage of the dwelling amount go towards those things in storage. Okay. All righty. Not of the dwelling amount, 10% of the personal property amount will go towards the storage. Okay. All righty. Sounds good. All right, well, I will send it out by Friday. If you have any questions in the meantime, just reach out to us. Okay. Okay, I appreciate it. All right, you're welcome. Have a good day. Thank you. Uh huh. Bye bye. Bye.
