Please have your name and your relationship to the policy. Yes, Jeff Edmonds. I'm with ISU Insurance Services, and I believe we are obtaining agent record at the upcoming renewal, which I believe is September the twenty-first. All right, let's take a look one moment, Jeff. Yep. Okay. Policy's opening, be just a moment. Sure, no problem. Okay, let's take a look at that AR change. Okay. And your agency code, please. It is three two seven zero one. Thank you so much. And how can I help you? Yeah, just call to see if the renewal has processed, just to kind of see where we are. I know we're a couple months out. Yeah, we do have a renewal offer. Would you like me to send you the deck page? That'd be great. Yes. Okay, what's your email address? Jeff J E F F. At my my alliance a l l i a n c e. Insurance. Dot com. Okay, that's Jeff at my alliance insurance dot com. All right, let me find that deck page for you. Just be a moment. Sure. When did this drop? Let's see. The updated deck page has not dropped. So I'm thinking this just happened today. I'm sorry, I some of that faded out. I apologize. That's okay. The deck page has not dropped yet. So I'm thinking this happened today, and the deck page will be available in the morning. Okay. But I can go over the details with you and then show you the deck page. Not all that necessary. I was really just trying to see if it had processed and if it did, if we could get a copy sent to us. And the next question I had was when I might be able to access it on for agents only. September twenty-first, twenty twenty-five. Okay, so yeah, that's that answers the question. So really, on on an agent record, we're not able to access the policy until the actual renewal date. Is that what you're saying? Yeah. Okay. Yes, it's very inconvenient, but that that that's the way it works. Yeah. Well, it is the way it is. So no, I think you've answered all I need. I guess well, do I need to call again tomorrow or can I get this? Yeah, just give us a buzz tomorrow. It won't be available for agents only, but if you give us a call, just let them know that you're the new agent of record and you need the the renewal deck page sent to you, and I'll send it right over. So you're saying it just renewed today, but the deck page is not available. Is that? It's not available yet because it would be there. It would be there if it was less than twenty-four hours. It won't be there. Okay, but it did renew, and so just call back tomorrow. Okay, perfect. Right, got the offer there. Okay. Thanks for your help. I appreciate it. Yep, bye bye. Welcome. Thanks for calling. Enjoy.
