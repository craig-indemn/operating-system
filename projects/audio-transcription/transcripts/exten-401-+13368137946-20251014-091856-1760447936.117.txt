Hello, this is Heather. Hi, Heather, this is Sylvia Hass. And I mean, hey, I was calling about where I received a refund on where I dropped my insurance on the Toyota. Uh huh. And I think I might be in mistake because I think they owe me a little bit more than they sent. Okay, okay. I was going to let it go and I thought, well, no, I'm going to make see why why why it's not you know what you know. Yeah, okay. And I always ask for you because I hate to say is nobody else. Acts like they know I don't know I'm just used to dealing with you you know I'm sorry but okay. It's okay. It's okay, hon. If I'm not available though, we do have some. Okay. A team that will help you, but. Okay. All right, and this is on the auto policy. See what they done. Auto media, let's get your billing. Billing detail. All right. So they refunded ninety seven nineteen. Right. She received. Yeah, I haven't in cash yet. I thought I'd make sure for. And see, I paid like three fifty nine. And I only had insurance, to. Probably less than two and a half months. I'm thinking I should got back at least half of that. There with me one second. Okay. All right. So when we made the change. It was two hundred nine eighty one. Here's the statement. Did they did they send you a statement? Not that I know of. I can email you this. Okay. Oh well, now I think you're talking about where I paid two hundred nine to start it on my other vehicle, the new vehicle. I'm thinking of paying. Okay. Two hundred nine. Yeah, okay, yeah, I had I did it a statement on that. Yeah, there was an additional premium for the policy change. On September twenty fourth, and they mailed a two fourteen eighty one. Your policy premium changed due to the following: We added the twenty twenty five tracks. Your remaining premium is as follows: six eighty seven, which is due on December twentieth. And then we did remove the vehicle, the other one. And that's what you're inquiring about is to get a refund. Yeah. We removed the other one. So yeah, that it was just in a credit of ninety seven dollars ninety seven. Nineteen. Yeah, that's what it shows, Sylvia. It's just ninety seven nineteen. Oh, can one sorry? Can you hold on just a moment? Uh huh. Yeah. All done is very wet. Okay. Do I call you or? No, not me. You call him. And you're going to let them know that it might not be okay. Okay. And you're sure even if it went through dry, you thought really washing it off it might be not. Yeah. Thank you, man. Okay. Okay, I'm sorry. Do what. You're fine, hon. Yeah, that's what it's showing is the ninety seven ninety seven. Yeah, so what happened to the whole three fifty nine and I only had it for like two and a half months because half of three. I mean, you know, I didn't have it half the times. What I'm wondering, did they? Well, you know I told you it would go up when you took a vehicle off. Oh, it does. Okay. Yeah, but still that was for this vehicle that was taken off. What I'm saying, but that's another thing you just said in December. Oh shit, something. It's um. Let me see what the next deal is. Because I will, I think you told me. Oh, okay. Okay. Five ten. Okay. Future installment at five oh five and then. Okay. Five dollars for. Let's see. Okay. Yeah, that second installment is five ten. Five hundred ten dollars. But yeah, when whenever you remove a vehicle, you know you're losing that multi vehicle discount. So you wouldn't have got the whole amount of what you paid for that one vehicle. I see. Okay. Okay. Yeah, sometimes it's less to keep one on there. Remember, I think we talked about that like.
