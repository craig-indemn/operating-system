Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hey, this is Anna. Hi. I'm sitting here with Ava. She's a banker here too, and I'm gonna put you on speaker so she can try to figure out what's going on. Okay. Okay. Hey, don't be scared. Can you hear us? Yes, I can. Do you want me to try to see if I can close it? Um, if you want to, I mean, just whatever you know makes y'all's lives easier. Because the border was like you don't even want the account anymore like you went and closed them like three times. Yeah, I did go in there. Um, well, I went in there today and I was like, I talked to Larissa and I said, Hey, I want to close all my accounts. I've been having issues. Uh, so she told me to go in, sign some paperwork, and then Marissa. I, yeah, Marissa. Um. Took care of it and she said that I needed to set up the online checking, and then she set up or help me set up. To be able to transfer to my other version of his account. I don't even know. So they told you like do credit close it or you could. Like, it's more the fact that she kind of didn't want me to close it. She wasn't just encouraging to. For her to help. Well, I have Ava here. I close the savings. I'm gonna try to. I'm gonna deposit this fifteen dollars into a checking account. And I'm gonna see if I can get into the online banking and try to like block the zel. Okay, because um I tried buying something earlier and it declined it, which was weird because I was like there's money in there but it just keeps declining. Yeah, I went on Mainframe. Um, I think it's just a like, what is it back office. They just put like a they flagged your card because, you try to get because probably one of the reasons was because you try to get cash out of a foreign ATM. A lot of times, I think that's one of the most causes they do it. But she's gonna try to close the savings, delete the online profile and see what happens in there because you receive zel through savings too when it opens back up. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And so the payment that Edward sent me didn't go through because on his it still says pending. So I told him to just call his bank and then just tell him to cancel that transaction. Yeah, that's what I'll do. But we're gonna look on that screen. I'll text you if we figure anything out. Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
