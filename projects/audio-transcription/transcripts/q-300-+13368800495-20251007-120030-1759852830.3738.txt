Good afternoon. Thanks, calling Alliance Insurance Services, Gina. Hey Gina, I just spoke with someone. I had received a notice in the mail that we owed an additional fifty two seventy one on our auto policy. And she was telling me that everything was showing paid up on her end. Can you explain this to me why we would be getting a notice? Okay, what name is it in? It's Susan and Terry White. Terry White T E R O Y. Yes T E R O Y. Give me one moment, okay. All right, I've got the policy number if you need it. Okay, go ahead and give me that too just in case. Okay, yes two zero two nine six five six seven four three.

Okay, you can disregard that. Looks like that was a company error, and I'm going to have waived and wrote off that premium of fifty two seventy one. So you can disregard that. Okay, thank you so much. I just wanted to make sure everything was okay. Have a good day, Miss Light. All right, thank you. I hope you do. Bye bye.
