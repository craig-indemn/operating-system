Hello. Hey, this is Ashley with Alliance Insurance. Hey, so I looked into it and I had one of the agents come look at it as well. So we are unable to change the last name on the home policy because on the tax tax card it still has Banger. Hmm. So that should be changing because the deed is not going to be in my maiden name. Okay. So. Oh gosh. Okay, well I'll um call the loan officer and see what she says. So I don't know. Okay. Well, thank you. So do you do you know how I get that changed or do I have to go to the tax office or? So um, Andrea, this is Brandi. I'm one of the agents here. Have you changed the deed into your into your new name? Well, it's being done right now because I'm doing I'm in the middle of a refi. I'm actually supposed to close. And they're changing everything to Andrea Aaronson because I've been divorced since 2016. Okay. Well, if if your loan person, whoever you're taking the loan out with, or refinancing and things like that, if they can send something with your new name, of what they're actually needing, then I will be able to change it. But I do also have to have you sign something. Um, to change the name on your home policy. Okay, well I'm I'm off today and I'm available. Um, so they are on the west coast, so of course they're three hours behind. Right. Us. Um, I sent her email. So I would tell her she just needs to give I guess the agent you all a call. Yeah, or she could just email us or, or if you want to put us in that email that you've been emailing back and forth with her. Okay. Um. I just need something to go off on to show proof to the company that you're switching everything over and to this new name. But I'll also I'll type up something too. And I have my loan documents on that I've been signing and things you know through email. I have those. Yeah, has Andrea and Nicole Aaronson my maiden name. Okay, yeah, send that over to us. Um. I'll have Ashley give you the email address to send it to, and but the subject line just put attention Brandi. Brandi, with that I or why. I. I okay. Yeah, and then we'll get that taken care of. But I'll also send you something to your email address that you can just click and sign. It'll just be like a letter stating, "Hey, I need to change my last name to Aaronson and you know I have proof available and then I'll just have you sign and date it. " Okay. Okay. Um, but the company normally uh takes a while for them to make changes like this. But I can type up a binder for you that'll have your new name on it. Okay. But it will take about I would say about two weeks to get this name changed through Universal Property and Casualty. Okay. Okay. Okay. But yeah, I'll let Ashley give you that email address. Okay. And we'll just go from there and I'll keep you informed. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. You're welcome, Andrea. Okay, so you ready for that email? I'm not actually. I'm I'm out walking. Is it any way you can? I don't know if this is this is a phone that you can text on or it's not. Um. Yeah, I can text it to you. Okay, because then I can do it as soon as I get in my car. But I'm just out walking. I don't have any hands. Okay. Um. All right, let's see. So the three three six um nine nine seven three two six six. Yeah. Okay. All righty. Well, I'll get that sent over to you. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye bye. Bye bye.
