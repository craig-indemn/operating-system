Thank you, Holiday. This is Heather. Hi, Heather. This is Sylvia. Okay, see, I misunderstood that first. I thought you meant just for that vehicle that, and I thought, wow, that's out there. But you are saying both vehicles that would be the price. Okay. Well, I mean, I don't know if you. I sent like pro rated, and then annual pro rated, and then the annual premium like for both vehicles. So yeah. I know you can see them whenever you are trying to do that. Yeah, yeah, really. Right, okay, and so you said that, and we want to take up now the rental is just where I get a rental car if my car is in a shop or something, right? Right. And how much am I paying for that? So I removed it. Did you get that second text I sent? You said if you remove that and and yeah. But I am not sure if I want that removed because I might need that you know. Well, usually if you have two vehicles, well, yeah, totally up here. Well, you are right as of now. I don't. You are right, but I might need it down the road in case I already had somebody ask me about my other vehicle and I thought maybe I will sell it. I don't know. But okay, and if something happened, that's another thing I need to. Well, whatever, but yeah, just. You are right. Just leave it all because I don't have it on there right now for the other vehicle, right? I don't need. Yeah, you see it. I did have it. Okay, well I thought that wasn't but a couple of dollars. You know, I thought it was. Yeah, you had it on there because you just have. Yeah, had one vehicle. Yeah, okay, but maybe I would like to keep that on there then. I don't know. Do you know what the price is for it exactly? I mean, how much am I paying? So the first quote I sent you was everything that we had talked about. Yeah, adding the vehicle, adding the two fifty. Right. For collision and then also adding the rental on there. Right. For this vehicle, for the new vehicle because you already had it. So basically, I just added that vehicle and then added collision and rental. To this vehicle, a new one. All right. So what if we just up that to up that to five hundred, but still kept the rental car on there? How much would it be? I know you said thirteen hundred something. We dropped that too, but okay. Do you do you want rental on both vehicles then? Uh. No, no, just on that one because you know I am. Okay. I just want to see what it would be because right now as of today, like you said, I don't need that. But I wonder how much it would be if I do have to add it back on. All right. So if we added the rental on, I've got your deductible at two fifty five hundred. No, oh two fifty on which one? You said two fifty five hundred. Oh, okay, okay. It's comprehensive on both, and then five hundred is collision just on the new. Oh, okay, okay, okay. All right. Excuse me. So by doing that, it's fourteen six seventy seven. And that's for the annual term annual premium, and then if you did that right now, it would be. Two twenty seven eighty one. Do. Yeah, I am getting so confused now. This one includes the rental car, right? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I am going to go back, man. And I just want to make sure it wouldn't get so high. You know, I am going to go back and leave it like you had it with no rental car because, like you said, as long as I got the other one, I wouldn't need it anyway. Okay. Let's go back and that was the. I think it was thirteen something right for the or yeah okay two fourteen is what I'd have to pay today if I get the vehicle. Okay. Okay. Well, so if I think I am going to go on and get the vehicle, and so if I get it today. There is an alliance office right here at Mars. You know across the road from Mars Chevrolet. Do I just go over there and pay that premium because I mean I have to have the insurance immediately when I leave here, right? You have it. You have the insurance. Yes, you just let me know if we're going to add it. If you want to run over there, you can or you can call us. Oh, I say I can go and add it and then you can bill me or whatever. They'll bill you. Cincinnati will send
