Good morning, Miss Trivet. How are you? I'm all right. How are you? I am doing well. Thank you for calling me back. You're welcome. That policy is actually due on March 1st. March the first. Yeah. Okay, that's okay as long as long as we know that that's when it is then I can put it on this form and then it will automatically switch over when it renews in March. Well, I have a question. Sure. How much is this going to cost me for my homeowners? Well, nothing right now because you still you've already paid your home for for the current year. Correct. I know that, but I mean when it's due, how much will it cost me? Well, we don't know that because the renewal numbers have not come out yet and they probably will not come out until the first part of February. Oh really? Yeah, yeah, they don't advance out the premiums that far, but normally within 30 days of the renewal, we should know how much it's going to be. Okay. But if it's, I can't remember what you told me how much it was this past year. Well, I was just looking at it. Let me look that. 134503. 1345. Okay, now you know that that will be cut a little bit when we do the auto policy because you do get discounts for having both both lines of business with them. Right, but we won't know what that number is going to be until the company produces those records for us. Yeah, well I know where I had an accident in 2022 that comes off also in January. It it apparently has come off with your premium dropping as much as as we quoted for you. Okay. Yeah, because there was a big there was a big difference in that in that existing auto premium and the one that I quoted for you. Yeah, okay, I know. Forgot how much you quoted me. Hold on a minute. I can tell you. Okay. Just take me a minute. Pull that here. And that was for a year also, wasn't it? It was. Yes, ma'am. Okay, okay. I like to pay it by the year if I can. If you pay all of it at one time, it's 122325, and that's for the full year and that's for the coverage that you have on there already. Okay. All right. And I will I will get those papers out to you this week. Okay. And you don't have to be in a rush to do it because everything's not due until the middle of next month anyway. Yeah, I think the 19th. Yeah, yeah, and I will be back in touch with you before then so we can go ahead and get this auto started. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good day. Thank you. You too. Bye bye. Bye bye.
