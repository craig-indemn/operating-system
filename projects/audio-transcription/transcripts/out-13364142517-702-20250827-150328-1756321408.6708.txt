Hello. Hi, Rachel. Hey, Rachel, got a question. Uh huh. We went by H and M and he's out sick today, and the girl that helped us said it would be tonight or tomorrow before he could get an estimate together. But she was indicating two to three thousand dollars. Now that's you know getting a tailgate and painting it and stuff, but Mike wanted in the labor and Mike wanted to know if that was going to make points go on our thing if it was that much. Think back. It could the first hole used to be less than eighteen hundred dollars. That they would waive an accident less than eighteen hundred dollars and at the moment I don't know what that is. Let me see if I can find out and then. Well, because save those points stay with you for three years. Well, see, I don't understand that. If you have a deductible and you have insurance, why do they have the right to put points on you? I don't, I don't get any of that. I know it's just to make money. I understand that, but you know I feel like our our insurance is so much higher than most people I talk to now. And I keep telling Mike he needs to look around and check because friends of mine don't pay near as much insurance as we do. And then to find out they're going to put points on you for a tailgate that that just seems astronomical to me. Well, it's it's an accident, and I mean if it was you know. Well, that's what you need insurance for. Well, that's Rachel. But. I mean, you need. I mean, you know, I don't know, but let me check on it and find out and then figure. Figure around three thousand dollars, okay. No, because that's that's going to be points. I can about tell you right now it's going to be. Points on there. Let me find out and then I'll let you know. Let me ask you this just between you and me just between you and me. If you all put points on us, does that mean if we go somewhere else the points go with you? Uh huh. Because they put they run a claim history for on MVRs. You get a speed ticket, you know speed tickets. They don't pay out. You know for a speed ticket, but if you get a speed ticket, say sixty, say seventy on a six five, it's a two pointer speeding violation on insurance. And they say you are paying and say on the Toyota Tundra right now you are paying two forty one for a year. Which is you know for that for that particular coverage of five hundred dollars deductible. But let me check on that amount. But I think it's less than I am going to say I I don't remember. Well, just just check and let us know. But it'll be it'll probably be. I guess you are off Monday, aren't you for Labor Day? Yeah, we're closed Monday. Probably next week or Friday. I mean, well, we've already we already made plans for Friday, but if we can't get by there Friday with it and he may not have it by Friday. I don't know what's wrong with him, you know or anything. Right, right. And but it be next week. Yeah. Next Wednesday, poor we could get you the paperwork, but if you could just give us an idea because. Mike said he didn't want points, you know. Right, I understand. I you know I know I know the feeling, you know. It just seems like every way we turn, it's more money, more money, more money. I know, I don't, I don't know how people are going to keep doing it. I just know. I don't know if I need what what the maximum would be before they would charge points. I might just pay that out of my pocket, you know and and and not not turn it in. What I am recommending, you know if if so that your insurance don't go up. Insurance will go up anyway, but it's because of all the claims you know catastrophic claims you know for vehicles like. They get the wash down the rivers and all that stuff. Yeah, you know their comprehensive claims, collision claims, liability claims. I mean, you can't go to emergency room and then intensive care unless if it's not thirty to fifty thousand dollars. Well, I know it it's crazy. It's just crazy. And see, I don't know. I don't know how people make enough money to have all these big houses and big cars and stuff. I just don't know where it comes from. I don't know either. Be honest. Well, all right, Rachel, honey. I didn't mean to bend your ear. I saw. No, that's fine. That's fine. I I totally understand
