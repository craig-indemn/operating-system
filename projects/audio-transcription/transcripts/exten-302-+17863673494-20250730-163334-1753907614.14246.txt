Thank you for holding, Misses Anna. How can I help you? Hi Anna, yeah, thank you so much. You sent me the proof of insurance for both the trailer, Great Dane, and the freightliner. Question: The the the payment there is that for all our vehicles. That's what your remaining payments for the year is. Okay, but let me let me let me just open this up. Okay. Yeah, so it's because since we are adding this, I want to say it was at mid-term. Not really. They calculate what is left to pay for the remaining months of the policy. Okay, but what what what does this what vehicles is this covered? The one thousand thirty-one. Okay, so because my husband called and he's like, "That's ridiculously high." So all we're covering is physical damage and bobtail, no cargo insurance, right? So your two of your two freightliners both have collision and comprehensive coverage at a thousand dollar deductible. The trailer is the one that is liability only. So that premium is for those three, the three total. Okay, so he says that because the the cargo is covered by the by the broker. So he doesn't he only needs physical damage and bobtail. So we need you want to remove full coverage on all vehicles. So it's going to just be exactly it it'll be the physical damage, just and and and then the non trucking liability which is a bobtail. Okay, so you want so I'll remove the liability on all the all the vehicles then. Okay, and I'll remove the full coverage the collision and the comp. Okay, so it'll only be physical damage and bobtail. What would be? Could you send me confirmation of what that what that means? Yeah, one second. They might get that change. I'm not sure if they're going to let me process the change since I already just did it. So it might take about 24 hours before I'm able to process a change again. Okay, that's fine. So just physical damage and bobtail, no comp and collision, right? Correct. Okay, all right. I'll let him know. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Alright. Okay.
