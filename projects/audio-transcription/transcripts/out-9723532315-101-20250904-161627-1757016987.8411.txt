Hello and thank you for calling Reliable Reports. If you know your party's extension, you may dial it at any time. Hello, this is Luke. Hello, this is Abani over the lines insurance. Just give me a follow up call. Gave me a call about Vintage Rose Chapel. Yeah, hey Abani, the absolute weirdest thing happened on that one. Like I tried that number on both my cell phone and my work phone earlier and it didn't go through on either one. And then I got a call like an hour and a half later from that same number, but like it was like a pocket dial. Like they they know that they had called me. Oh wow. So I don't know there must have just been some kind of blocker on there or something. I did I hung up and then I just called back and you know left a message. I was able to get through the second time. So no idea what happened the first time but so I was able to leave a message for the insured over there. I think it was Charlotte. Okay. Yeah, I was about to say we we just just kind of got a call from them about two weeks ago. So we're pretty sure that number was still operating. So was about to say strange you got cut off that quick but yeah I'm glad you got got through to them and you know if you can't get in touch with them just kind of get back with us and we'll see what we can do. Yeah that's fine yeah I'll leave another message next week and if I can't get a hold of them I'll give you a call back let you know all right man yeah good day you too bye.
