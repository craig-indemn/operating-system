Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Brandi, this is Vicki Shepard. I was just returning your call from yesterday. Okay, let me get you pulled up, Vicki. Okay, so the 521 Boyd Nelson Road. Is that the property listing? No, that is not the the one and that was the one I was afraid you had. Let me look right here. Because that was the one that was connected to that policy number. Okay. See. I probably read the wrong one. Tell you then. Yeah, I did. There it is. All right, one. I am. Well, it's the one on. Old fifty two. Shoot, that is right out here. Two hundred eight eight North Old Fifty Two in Pinnacle. That's it. That is it. That's it. All right, and when did you sell that property? Sold that in March, I think last March. March or May. Okay, so since it's that long ago, I can only backdate thirty days unless we have. Unless we have closing documents to show. That far back. Well, I mean, I have the closing documents. I mean, as far as the, you know, sales. I do have those. It took me many. Okay. Yeah, I mean, if you have the closing documents, if you can send them to me, I might be able to get this backdated all the way to March and then you can get some money back from that. Oh, okay. Well, yeah, yeah, I hadn't even thought about. I mean, when I sold the house, it wasn't that much. It was not that that much over, you know, override. So I thought I'm not going to call you. I'll just let it let it be insured, and when it runs out, the little couple that bought it can you know. Do it. Yeah, but. I mean that policy started in February of last year, so if it was in March, then you technically should have only paid for one month and you should have got the rest of it back. Okay, and I I really don't think that's right as far as when I'm telling you, but let me look at let me look it up and I'll get it I'll get them to you. Okay, no problem. Did you receive the the email that I had sent you? Yesterday, I said. Yeah, I sent it yesterday after I left your voice after I left you a voicemail. Oh no, I've been checked. Have not checked. Well, if you if you do have it, you can just respond back to that email. That way it'll alert me and let me know that that that I have it. Okay. But if not, then we will backdate it thirty days and then I'll need you to sign a cancel form. Either way, so just let me know. All right, thank you. I'll do it. You're welcome, Vicki. Have a nice day. You too. Bye bye. Bye.
