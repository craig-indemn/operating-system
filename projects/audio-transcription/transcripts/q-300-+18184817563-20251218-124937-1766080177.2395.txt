And it's true progressive. I have the. I have the policy number. I think I found it. Okay. Just to verify, I don't have this number listed. Is this a good phone number for you? No, no, I'm using this. My other phone is actually in the. I had to use this phone to be able to do the insurance questions to know what to ask you. So this is not. Okay, all right. So 336 306 0726 is still good. Yeah. That's my wife. And okay, good. And I have an email read2500 at roadrunner dot com. Is that okay? Yep. Okay. Let's pull up the policy. All right, it's getting pulled up. What all do you need? Well, it's asking me if it's comprehensive coverage and if so, what the deductible is. Is it on us? Which vehicle is it on? The Jeep Grand Cherokee the 2021. Yes, you do have comprehensive and collision deductibles are both 500. 500. Okay. Thank you. I'll go to the next question.

Does the policy have a lien holder listed? Yes, we have First Citizens Bank listed. That's going to be going to True Liant, but. See. When you get everything done, get their lien holder address. How they need it listed and just let us know and I can update it. It says if you have a copy of your insurance policy documents, you can upload them here. Says this step is optional but will speed up the verification process. I don't have them so maybe we just skip that. What's the? Is it a website? I can probably upload it for you.
