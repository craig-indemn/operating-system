Hello. Hi. Good morning. My name is JC. We received your voicemail. We're calling from Alliance Insurance. How are you doing today? Hey, I'm doing all right. How about yourself? Wonderful. I'm doing okay. Thank you so much for asking. All right. Um, I was calling. Uh, I added full coverage to two more vehicles, and the price was a little. Little high. I was wondering is it something? Was it a mistake or? Okay, let me double check if you don't mind Terry. Just confirming your address for me, please. It's five East Thirtyth Street, Winston Salem, North Carolina. Two seven one zero five. Thank you very much. Okay, so. The vehicles that I have are the 2012 Dodge Ram 2003 Ford Mustang 2002 Lexus. Are those vehicles correct? Yes. Okay, and then the 2012 Dodge Ram. It's looking like we have a deductible for the comprehensive of a hundred dollars, and then collision. Is a 500 deductible with towing. Yeah, the truck wasn't my concern. It's the I just added the other two vehicles. Oh yeah, I'm running down through all your entire policy just to make sure that everything is correct. Okay. So I've got so that for the 2012 Dodge Ram. That's correct. Cars. Yeah, I mean my. Okay. Cars. I know. Yeah. Okay, and then that 2003 Ford Mustang. I have actually the exact same coverage for that one. Okay. What about the next? And the Lexus, exact same coverage. Okay, oh, but the truck is a 2000. 2012 and the sting is 03 and the Lexus is 02. 339. Okay. 2012. So the VIN number that we put in is really what determines how much price is going to be. We really don't have a way to affect it if that's the coverage that you're needing for that vehicle. Um. Is it just yourself as a driver? Right. Yes. Okay. Yeah, we really don't have a way to affect the price once we put in the information. The coverage is progressive, then calculates all of that. And lets us know what the premium is going to be. Um, based on again the VIN number, the type of vehicle, so they have different. Different ways of rating that. Right. Right. But. I just put the insurance on there. It wasn't. It wasn't even a thirty day left. I just put the full coverage on the other two maybe. Two weeks ago. Okay. And it ain't been a whole month and it's 300 something dollars already. Just put them on there. A week and a half ago actually. I'm trying to look at the system here. Right. Yeah, I thought that would be like maybe the next bill after this one, but. No, unfortunately they do charge you from the moment that you add the vehicle. Sometimes some companies require you to have a down payment. But they are charging from the day that the vehicle was added. Some companies don't. Make that effective until the next billing cycle, just because of the way their billing is set up. But they they'll send out that renewal or not renewal. I'm sorry, the next billing. If if we added the vehicle and the billing goes out, let's say if we added it today. And the billing doesn't go out until the 15th, then they're able to bill you that billing cycle. If not, they would bill you the next billing cycle. So the way that yours is set up. They were just able to bill you the next couple weeks. To your billing. Right. I'm trying to look up the billing payment schedule. Yeah, it was kind of you know kind of sudden. Yeah, little sudden. Well, sometimes like I said, some companies will ask for a down payment. But they are charging you from the moment that you add that vehicle. Right. I mean everything was on the policy. I just added. Oh the the okay I got you yes. Everything is all. That's probably yeah that probably is another factor of why they were. Able to to bill you so soon. I was thinking we were adding a vehicle. I'm sorry I apologize. No, I was just changing the full towing on the other two. Gotcha. Okay. Now did you still want to keep it that way? If it's going to be that high, no. Okay. And are you looking to? Yeah, I'm gonna make the payment, but if it's going to be that high every month, then then no, you could. Just run your regular on the other two like it was like like it was before. Okay, so we
