Hello, this is Jeff Edmonds. Can I help you? Hey Jeff, it's Lisa Brothers with American Cornerstone. Yeah, hey Lisa, good afternoon. How are you today? Yeah, it is. I'm getting by. That's good. What can I do for you? Just wanted to touch base on and just ask a couple questions. Just first off, see how we are going as far as getting insurance set up. Yes, we are getting very close. We have gotten two proposals from Penn National. We are reviewing those and workers comp. I'm still a little bit confused on the workers comp part based on how much payroll we should actually show because your existing policy and I'm not looking at it here but your existing policy with Builders Mutual only shows a very small amount of actual payroll so. Right, so that's actually what I was calling to check with you on because you know we're with Builders Mutual so and and the reason we went with them like years and years ago when you know starting with Gary as we would we had like at one point being in construction and being new we had all these employees and then all of a sudden we didn't but we are still paying these huge premiums and you know so it was every year it was offsetting and then the next year we weren't paying enough and then we get an audit and then we you know oh and so we you know Gary said let's go with Builders Mutual because then you pay on a monthly basis based only on your payroll. Like a reporting form is what that calls. So I set up on reporting form with them. Is that how that is? Okay. Yeah and and I know everything is good because I get an audit every single October from them and you probably don't owe or get it or or owe any money back because you're doing it on reporting form is that right and no yeah sometimes I'll get like a small credit like forty dollars or something where it was just you know something minimal on there but they don't and we are excluded off of there because we're the owners of the business so that's why the payroll looks low on there because at this point now we only have one true employee since we've lost our son from the company and and so with us with myself and my husband ours has never included on the workers comp. Right. So I guess then in order and you know everybody I think everybody that we would offer offers a reporting form I'm just trying to figure out how much payroll to actually quote on an annual basis. Well, here's my question: Why would we? Why do we have to? Why do I have to leave Builders Mutual? You don't. You you absolutely don't. The a an advantage of having everything in one place and by one place I mean one agency not one company but you know if you have Builders Mutual where you have it now. Builders Mutual, we're relatively new to Builders Mutual and if we were to go to them and say, "Hey, we're writing all of this customer's other lines of business with other carriers." Their built their workers comp is better off with you. There are some instances where we could go to a company and say, "Can you if the insured approves it, can you make us the agency of record on that as opposed to the agency that it's written with you through now." Most of the time we can get that done with Builders Mutual because our contract with them is relatively new. That's not an option for us right now. So what that means is if you were to keep this workers comp with Builders Mutual, it would need to stay at the agency it's at now. Not a problem. We're we're okay with that. We can write your other business without writing the workers comp. The issue for you could be when it comes time to request certificates. You've got to go to two agencies now to do that as opposed to just one. And again, that's not a major issue. It's just one more call or one more email you need to make when it's time for a a COI. Other than that, there's there's no issue with you keeping this Builders I'm sorry this workers comp where it is if that if it makes sense for you to do that and I'm not so sure that it doesn't make sense for you to do that to be honest because you like the setup your setup on reporting form now through them I can offer you a quote I just didn't know how much payroll annually to quote to to use in order to to give you an apples to apples comparison on the workers comp part. Did that make right and that's I hope I hope yeah no it makes it makes perfect sense and it's it's actually the reason why it was so desirable when we did switch because I never knew how much payroll to ever tell insurance either you know because I'd always get it wrong because it just fluctuates too much in in commercial construction. Well, the the and and we understand that and the company that I had
