Sorry, all this is going to help. Hey Cody. Hey Cody. Hey, this is Victor Santiago. Hey Victor, how are you? Good, how are you? I'm doing pretty good. I was calling because, so I think I don't know if my account it didn't go into to autopay, and because I was talking to the to the receptionist right now that like two days ago, um they charged my card like three thousand five hundred. And normally the payments are like a thousand, but and so well I was I was also I hadn't made a payment because I thought I was an auto draft, it was automatically going to take the payment but. But well, I mean it did it did try to take a payment but it tried to take off like like like three thousand five hundred, when normally it's like a thousand like a thousand and one hundred. Did you not do your audit? Because I've noticed that travelers if you're on autopay and you don't complete your audit, then they tack on the the uncooperative audit. Yeah. Onto your billing account and then they automatically draft for that. So if you didn't do your audit, then that's probably what happens. Yeah, I think I remember. I think you I think I remember you telling me about that that the audit was going to be do soon. Let's see. But but I know I haven't done that. Yeah, I see it here. Non compliant audit bill two thousand seven thirty four plus your normal one thousand fourteen. So yeah, they drafted thirty seven forty eight twenty five. Yeah. But right now I was looking at my card and it took it put the I guess they gave me the money back or it like reversed the transaction. What did they reverse? The whole payment because it had got me into the negatives, but now I have the money back. And it's like I'm trying to I'm trying to look for the transaction where it took the thirty five thirty seven, but now I can't find it like it it went away. So. So I was just confused. I'm like I wonder why or I don't know what happened. Or if I need to do that audit. Reverse the charge where you said they didn't have enough money in it, but now you said that it charged again because it shows the. No, no. Sorry, oh. Oh no, mine just says it's reversed. Like I have money on my account now. When and right now it was showing me that I was on negative like yesterday. So did the thirty seven forty eight twenty five come out of your account or no? At first it did, but because it had put me into negative, but now now I have the funds back again. Yeah, because it shows the thirty seven forty eight twenty five was paid on the twenty second, but then after that you said that they got reversed. Yeah, what or I mean, I'm trying to look for the payment, but I can't find it anymore. Okay. And earlier I could see it like where it had taken that amount away. It had put me in. It shows that it was taken out on the twenty second. Is that what it was showing before? Yeah, yeah, like I could see it, where it said that it had charged the thirty seven. Okay. But now I can't even find it. And I even went back like a few days when I could I couldn't I checked it like twice. I'm going to email you this letter from travelers you should have received. I don't know if you received it in your email or just regular mail, but it gives you a number and an email that you can contact to get your audit taken care of. Once you complete the audit, so I don't know if they've actually taken the money out and reversed it or or if they're going to draft it again or what they're going to do, but regardless you're going to have to get your audit completed and then that will get everything sorted out. So obviously whatever money that they take for the non compliant audit, they will obviously refund you if they owe you something after you actually do your audit. Let me see. Okay, Victor Santiago audit letter. Audit. Been staying busy, Victor. Yeah. Yeah, I've had a busy week. Right now I'm in Ohio. Oh, okay. Santiago Victor seventy seven at yahoo dot com. Santiago Victor seventy seven at yahoo. Okay. All right. Um, I am sending this to you right now. Like I said, there's a phone number and a email on here, Victor. So you can call or you can email. Calling is probably the best, but I'm not sure exactly what their process is. But you just want to reach out to them and get the audit reopened. And then once you get it completed, they'll obviously reverse the non compliant audit charge that fee. And then obviously they're just going to adjust whether or not
