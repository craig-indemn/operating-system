Hello. Hey, Miss Perez, this is Gary at Lions Insurance. Oh, hello. Uh, did you get your question answered or what can we do for you? No, no. Um. So my son, he drives one of my vehicles to work, um, but I was wondering like, now that he's um. Uh, twenty two. Um, what was the policy? Like, did he get his own policy? What would that would cost him? Does he have his own vehicle? No, no. If he does, if we do not issue any non owner type policies. Uh huh. So until he gets a car, he cannot get a policy through us for a non owner. And if he lives with you, then he needs to be on yours anyway. Okay, okay. So it also be. So you know until he gets a car, it depends on the vehicle also that he has. Well, and the coverage. Um, you know if he just buys something with liability, it's naturally going to be less expensive than something with full coverage. Uh huh. Yeah. But that's what I would suggest is when he gets that vehicle in his name, then you can have him get his own coverage and we can take him off yours. All right, all right. Well, thank you. You're welcome. Bye.
