Hello. Hey, Miss Arpola, this is Gary at Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm good. Well, how are you, Gary? I was just following up to make sure that somebody from the claims department had been in touch with you. Yeah, they called me, and they said they were going to look for the vehicle that hit my vehicle and then they would take it from there. But so far no repairs have been done for my car yet. Okay, but you have been in touch with them, so you have started that conversation anyway, right? Yes, I have. We just wanted to make sure that they did not drop the ball on it as well. So that's the reason for my call today. And then if you have any other questions or something else comes up, feel free to call us back. Okay. Thank you. Thanks for checking. Yes, ma'am. Have a good day. Me too. Bye bye. Yes.
