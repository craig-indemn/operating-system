It's a great afternoon alliance insurance. This is Jamie. Hey, I'm calling because I have recently. Well, I was on National Generals, and then they switched me over to auto homeowners insurance because I had to get a rental policy because I am moved and I need a rental insurance which I never have. But my. Was it called National General Insurance? My renewal starts tomorrow, so I don't want to pay it because I'm supposed to go over to the auto owners insurance. Policy which is like way cheaper too, but when I go online, the only thing that's on there is my rentals. And she had called me earlier today. I can't remember who, but I was in the hospital. For an appointment, so I need to get that taken care of before my insurance laps. Okay, just like this is Shelley Kirkland. I'm sticking with. Yep. Okay, give me one moment. Looks like you were sticking with Brandi. Yeah, but then she said she couldn't. I got the text and I misread it. She said she couldn't talk after three, but I didn't get out of the hospital till like almost three and I texted her but I haven't heard back from her. So she may not be available. Let me see. She's got to go on here. I think she said she wasn't available after three, but it's. After three. Um. So she can't talk, but she said she said I just need payment info and I will issue the policy. Don't know how. Let's see if I can see. Yeah, what's like what do you mean the payment info? Yeah, like card or check. I think it's what she means there. Let's see if I can see this Kirkland quote. I do that open this thing up here. Should be. How much is the payment? Yeah, how much is the first payment? Give me one moment here. Let me get this thing open here. Yeah, sorry. It's okay. Okay, Shelley Kirkland, 2701 Griffith Road in Winston Salem. No. Like, well, I moved. You moved. Okay.
