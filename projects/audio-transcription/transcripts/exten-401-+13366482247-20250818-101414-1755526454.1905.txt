Thank you for holding. This is Heather. How are you? Heather, this is Danny. I apologize. Hey, Danny. Yes, I am working on your homeowner insurance. I called and left you a message. I would like to quote the auto with it. Is that okay? I know we used to have both. I just paid my auto a couple months ago, but anyway, yes. I mean, if you can switch it all over, it that would be fine. For me. Yeah, because I know with our carriers, most of them are bundling now. So if I just do the home, you are not going to get a whole lot of. Quotes back, and then if you do the auto with it, you are going to get more. And same with Farm Bureau. I think you are with Farm Bureau now, and. I know if you move the home away from the auto, then either they're going to increase your premium on the auto. If you take the home away, or they they might even non renew. I am not sure if Farm Bureau non renew. But either way, yeah, we would like to keep it all together. That's. Yeah, they don't. It's not as good a price with Farm Bureau either. You don't do the whole thing. Right. Okay. Yeah. So what? What vehicles do you have, Danny? I have a twenty twenty Lincoln MKZ. I think it was insured with you at one time. Well, we tried to pull everything, and unfortunately, we're not having much success in pulling all that data. So that's why I was trying to get in touch with you. A twenty twelve Lincoln MKZ. Yeah, two thousand eight Nissan Maxima. Okay. A twenty twenty five F one fifty Lariat.
