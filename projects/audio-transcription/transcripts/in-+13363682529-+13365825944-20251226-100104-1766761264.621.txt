Good morning, Larry Petrelli. Yes, ma'am. My name is Larry Batlock. I just want to make sure I had paid my car insurance this month. I got a bill the other day, and I'm pretty sure I paid it towards the month, but I want to make sure. Okay, all right, Larry. Let me get it pulled up here. Okay. You doing okay today? Pretty good. I'm done with the holiday blues, so I'm glad that's over. Oh, well, good, good. I'm glad that's over for you. So it shows last payment was on December the 10th for 171 and 19 cents. Wait, so I am up to date. That's all I need to know. Um and let let me look and see um when your next payment is here. Okay, should be January 25th. Yep, you're right because it's showing paid in full. So yeah, that'll be your renewal date. That January the 25th. Got a problem. I appreciate it. All right, Larry. You take care. You too. Have a happy new year. You too. Bye bye. Bye.
