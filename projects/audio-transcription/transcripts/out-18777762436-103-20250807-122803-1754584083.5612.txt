I'm calling from Alliance Insurance. Oh, and Gloria, can you spell your last name, please? V is in Victor, A is in Apple, L, L, S. And then I have policy loading for Rose Logistics LLC. That's correct. Okay, how could I help? I was just calling to understand the billing because the client said they made a payment. And I was checking online. It looks like they were refunded the payment, and they said they made the payment again. Gotcha. Okay, let me go through the billing and the policy activity, and then I'll be right back with you. Alright, thank you. Thanks. Thank you so much for your patience. I do appreciate it. Thank you. So the bill that shows for August twenty seventh is two bills. It's July and August. Okay. So what happened? Just kind of starting from June since that's where everything was just kind of. Like a invoice went out, payment was made. So we can start from June. July when they did the cancellation on the policy because they didn't receive the information about the vehicles. So they processed the cancellation or they put the cancellation on the policy effective of July twenty sixth. So that gave the insured a refund because essentially we were charging for coverage up until July twenty sixth. So we received the information, put the we removed the cancellation from the policy, and we're going to continue. So now we need the six hundred thirty three dollars and thirty cents back. And so that was basically us getting back the money that we had already. Or was supposed to already collect on the policy, but we never actually did a July payment. So that's why July and August is combined together. Okay. Okay. So the the six thirty three he made. Now and then he got a refund, did and then he made it again. So did that clear the second time the second time he made the payment. Um. The second time it was with a credit card. So yes, it cleared because credit cards pull immediately. Okay, and then so how much does he owe right now? So right now. It is one thousand seven hundred twenty eight dollars and fourteen cents. Fourteen cents and this is for July and August. Yes. Okay, so the payment he already submitted the six thirty three that covers June payment. So no, that that six thirty three was the refund that we gave the insured. So essentially, he just paid the refund back. That June payment it was eight sixty four, eight hundred sixty four dollars and fifty seven cents, and he paid June. Okay, so the six thirty three was the refund. Okay, so I just want to write it down so I can explain to him. So the six thirty three is the refund. He got after the policy was canceled. Yes, after we put the policy in a pending cancel because we didn't get the information about the vehicles. Okay. Yes. Okay. So that basically the six thirty three he paid he just gave you guys the money he owes you. Yes. After you refunded him, so now he needs to pay the one thousand seven hundred and twenty eight dollars and fourteen cents. Yes. And how long does he have? Like how many days does he have to pay that before some kind of cancellation? Well, the due date for that amount is on August the twenty seventh. Okay. Um, and then I mean before canceling the policy, it would go into like a pending cancellation, but we would always send out a letter. Um. For a pending cancellation. Alright, thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. Is there anything else I can help with today? No, that'll be useful right now. Awesome. Thanks so much for calling in. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Have a wonderful day. You too. Alright, bye.
