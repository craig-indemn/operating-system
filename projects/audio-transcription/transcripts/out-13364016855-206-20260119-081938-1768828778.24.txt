Hey, this is Cheryl. Leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you. Hey Cheryl, good morning, Jeff Edmonds with Alliance Insurance. It is a Monday morning about 8:20 a.m. Hope you guys are doing well. Just wanted to give you a call and follow up on our review from last week. I sent you guys an email out on Thursday morning, I believe, with some review and some answers to the questions that were raised the other day. And just wanted to follow up with you on that to see if you had seen that and if you had if you had questions. There were a couple of action items on there, just kind of wanted to see which way you wanted to go there. If you could sometime today, give me a call back at 336-377-9003. Our phone lines actually don't open up until 9:00 a.m. So if you could wait until after 9:00 a.m. That would be good. But yeah, just call that number, ask for me, Jeff Edmonds, and they will get you over to me. Look forward to hearing from you. Thank you, bye bye.
