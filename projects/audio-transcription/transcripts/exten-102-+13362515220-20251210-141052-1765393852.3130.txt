Sorry about the hole. This is Gloria with Alliance Insurance. Good afternoon. Hi Gloria, this is Lauren. I'm calling from Institute for Classical Architecture and Art. You helped me with the address change a couple months ago for our policy. But I'm actually I need to get a copy of our policy to send to our national organization. Is there any way I can get that email to me? Let me see. What's the name on the account again, please? It's Institute of Classical Architecture and Art. It's North Carolina chapter. Okay, and it's is it Charlotte chapter of ICA and CA? I think. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's what we have with you now account. And can you confirm the address for me, please? Yeah, it's seventy three o eight East Independence Boulevard Suite C, B seven nine Charlotte, North Carolina two eight two two seven. All right, perfect. Thank you so much. So you need a you need the distribution page. I need the whole policy. The whole policy. Okay. Do you mind if I ask why? So we are we are under a national organization and every year we need to send them our policy that shows that we've named. Oh, you have insurance. Okay. Perfect. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so we understand. Let me see. Which email address would you like me to send that to, please? I hope you have mine in there. It's Lauren L A W R E N. Do you have that one? Yes. Yeah, you can send it there. All right, perfect. I'll I'll go ahead and get this document over to you. Anything else I can help with today? How so? I'm the chapter coordinator and our president currently I think has online access to this but he's rolling off of our board. Is there like a way to get our treasure? Like how can I get digital access to our account? Okay. Yes, so what would you do? Yes, you can do that. We can definitely do that. So what you can do is like you can email us. Like right now on your contact list, we only have Nora Black. As the point of contact to this policy, so you can provide us with the name of other people you want to for us to update in our system. So that in case we want to reach out to you guys, we can just reach to any of you and get and like give any of you access to the policy. And then what about online access that will happen to you? I think you can. Or is that even a thing? I know our treasurer paid a bill online, but is there even any other access online? Like the policy is not available online, right? Is that? No, it's it's available online. Okay. Yes, there is a website. It's called USLI. What you do is you go and set up an account. So he could set once it's changed his name, he could set up an account. Yes. Okay, and don't do that because actually Nora Black passed away, so she's not even. Oh my god. That was last that was last year. I mean, so we we don't we don't need to get it once a year. So yeah, all right. I will I will send an email. Can I just write back to the email I have? When you send me. Do you have a do you have our support email or you have somebody else's email? Which email do you have? I have support. Yes, perfect. That will work great. Yes, send us the names of the people you would like for us to update in your account as point of contact. So we need like names and phone number and email address so that we can easily be able to reach out to you guys whenever we need to communicate something in regard to your account. Okay, great, and you'll send me that policy. Yes. Yes today. Okay. Yes. Thank you so much. I really appreciate your help, Gloria. Thank you so much. You have a wonderful day. You too, bye.
