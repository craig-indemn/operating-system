Thank you for calling Nationwide. This is John. May I have your name, please? This is Cody Jackson of Alliance Insurance Services. Hi Cody, how are you doing today? All right, how are you? You doing good. Thank you so much for asking, and thank you for providing the name of the agency. Can you please help me with the name of the policy? Jose Espardo Herrera. There you go, perfect. And I successfully pulled up a record here. Thank you for your delaying our IVR. How may help you today? I'm trying to figure out. It looks like the general liability and the inland marine policy canceled, but this business auto policy is still active. Can you tell me what's going on and if this canceled and why it canceled? I mean a payment was made on 9325, so I'm a little confused because the due date is tomorrow. Is it absolutely? I'll be more than happy to assist you with that. I'm just going to double check my resources here to confirm the reason why. Some of the policies are canceled while the business auto still active. So just give me one moment. Hold on for a second. I'm pulling up now the policy here. One sec. Okay. Thank you very much. All right, so there you go. I'm there hosting the S Paris policy, and let me check. Oh, okay. So I noticed that there's also a cancellation for business auto that. Been pending on our policy. So what we're going to do is to manually push the cancellation on this. So basically, I just want to inform you that all of the policies that you mentioned, starting from the business auto, inland marine, and general liability, has been canceled. On September 23rd of 2025, and did you mention that there's already a payment that was made? It shows that a payment was made on 9325, so I'm trying to figure out why these policies are canceled. It doesn't make any sense. Let me just go ahead and double check that one. So in the meantime, is it possible for me to please the call on hold? That's fine. Thank you so much. I'll be right back. Okay. Hi, thank you so much. So patiently waiting. Hello Cody. Hello. All right, so I noticed that the automatic payment has been removed from the policy, and based on the payment that you mentioned last September 3rd of 2025, it's returned as non sufficient funds, and that why the auto payment. Auto fee has been removed on the policy, and also there's a charge for 30 dollars for non sufficient funds on this, and that's the reason why the policy has been canceled. Okay, can you check to see if we can reinstate this policy and how much needs to be paid, please? Absolutely, I'll be more than happy to assist you if any type of reinstatement of the policy. I just want to confirm: would there be any losses? Same September 23rd of 2025. No sir. Be too very much. I'll just be placing the call on hold for a moment. Stay on the line. I'll be right back. Thank you so much. Thank you.
