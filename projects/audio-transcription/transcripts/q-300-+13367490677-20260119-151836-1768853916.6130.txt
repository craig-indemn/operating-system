Thank for holding us, Gary. Yes, how are you? I'm well. How are you? I'm all right. How can I help you? Um, so I was told I needed to make a claim for um, a scratch on my vehicle that was made. And how long ago did that happen? Um, that was yesterday. Just yesterday. Yes. Okay, let me get me a piece of paper. I need to write some stuff down. I didn't even know I was able to do it until my friend told me that I can claim it with my insurance. What exactly happened or caused it or did you know? So I basically left the the gym and um I noticed that there was like a huge scratch like on the side of my vehicle and then on the hood but it looks like someone literally did it because you can just literally see how the line goes up to the hood and then it makes a big circle on there. Okay, what's your name, dear? Uh, first name is the Ori, V A O R I. Last name is Westa. Yeah, Zazen Zebra, A O R I. Okay. And where did it happen, Francine? At the Williams YMCA in Winston Salem. Is that downtown? Yes, like outside of downtown. Yes. And that's the one that's off of Renolda Road. Um, no, it is. I'll give you the address right now. Okay, let me check it. It is the seven seven five W and Boulevard. Westan Boulevard. Yes. And about what time of day was it that that you were down there? Um, it I left around one thirty. Okay, so you you found it at about one thirty in the afternoon. Yes. Okay. And is that the only car that you have on your policy? No, I have multiple ones. Okay, let me get that pulled up. Spell your first name for me. Uh, Zazen Zebra, A O R I. Oh, that's your first name. Yes. Okay, what's your last name? H U, E R C A. Yeah, I was going backwards here. Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. Okay. Where the? Yeah. Okay, got you. I'm waiting on the computer here, so just bear with me just a minute. Um. Okay, which vehicle was it? The Honda. Okay, I've got a Honda CRV and a Honda Civic. The Honda Civic. Honda Civic. Okay. Yeah, that's a little one, right? Yeah. Yeah. And where where which side is the damage on? Um, the the left side. The driver side. Yeah, the driver side of the vehicle and then the hood. Okay. Okay. Did you report it to the police or anything? No, I didn't. Okay. Okay, now on the Civic, there's a 500 deductible. So whatever the estimate is, that it will take to repair it. They will deduct that 500 from the total amount. Um, the the best advice that I could give you is to before we report it, maybe check with a body shop. And see what kind of an estimate they give you for the repair. Because if if it comes in less than 500 or really close to 500, you may not even want to turn it in. Well, for example, let's say it costs 700 to fix it. The company is only going to pay you 200. And then you're going to have that incident on your claims history on your claims record. Okay. That could affect your rate. So unless it's going to be a tremendous amount, I think I would check to find out what a professional is going to charge you to do the repairs. Okay. And then we can come back and and do what we need to from a claim standpoint. Okay, see, I'm glad I'm glad you told me that. That's really what I wanted to ask to get more information because I'm not familiar with with that. But you definitely helped me on that. And I also have one more question. Sure. So um, do you guys also what how do you guys do with like windshields as well? Well, if on the three cars other than the old truck that you have on the policy, you have 500 deductibles on that as well. So if you broke if you broke a windshield, then if it comes in at less than that 500 dollar figure, then you would have to pay for yourself. Okay. All right. All right. Thank you so much. And I'm gonna I'm gonna put a case out here and make a note out here. And my name is Gary G A R Y. Okay. And if you can get that information on the claims and you feel like you want to go ahead and move forward with with submitting it
