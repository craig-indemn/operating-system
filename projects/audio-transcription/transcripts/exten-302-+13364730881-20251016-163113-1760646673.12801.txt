Thank you for holding. This is Anna. I can help you. Hey, this is Ivan from Mount Expressive. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. I was looking on my client hub, but I was trying to find my liability insurance for the business, and I don't see it on this client. I see the workers comp and the auto. All right, let me take a look. Give me one second. Okay. Okay, so that's with the Utica policy, your commercial package. Okay, it don't link to this client hub. What client hub? I'm sorry. Well, it's it's one of these things, Christopher. Last year, I want it's called client hub. You log on to it, got a lines insurance services, got an overview, and it shows my two my policies two workers comp and automobile. Are you talking about glove box? Yep. Okay. Yep, glove box client hub. I guess you call it. Yeah, my gloveboxapp dot com. That's it. But when I open it, it says client hub. It's top. Okay. So. And the only thing attached to is your auto and workers comp. That's all on that. Yeah. Okay, but you don't see the package. That's the liability. Okay. I believe it's like that with Christopher's here because he said it's going to fix it, but they never did. Okay. Give me one second. Okay. Are you needing some specific for it while I'm trying to figure out why it's not showing? Yeah, I've got. I got to get a certificate insurance for the county over here to show that we got liability workers comp. I think I got the workers comp right. I sent an email. And it says certificate request. So maybe maybe they're going to send me one that way. I actually have that request. It just gets sent to our support email. Yes. But it didn't list who would score. It just has your information. It's got my name. Yeah, I didn't. It said T O C. So I figured that's pointing contact with me. But I had clicked on the. I clicked on like the workers comp and then that's how I got over there somehow. I went to document. Oh yeah, I went to document and I and I said, request a document. And what type of document you need? I put certificate for verification of coverage. I clicked on that. And then that's where I filled out that other information. Okay. But yeah, if you can email me, that'd be fine. Uh, Surrey County, uh, building inspectors. Is that the address you listed on here? Is that there? The one fifteen foothill drive. No, that's the one's here. Okay, that's what I was saying. Everything that you submitted was just your information, so I didn't have any of the certificate stuff. Okay. Well, let's let's do it this way then. There is. Okay. Surrey County Inspection Department. Okay, hold on. Okay, then what's address? One two two Handy Road, Dawson, North Carolina. Two seven zero one seven. Okay. If you want to, you can send it straight to them and just copy me on it. Do you um? Have an email for them. I do. It says central c e n t r a l permitting one word. P e r m i t t i n g. At c o dot sury dot n c dot u s. Okay. Okay, I will get this sent over here in the next few seconds. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome, and I'll take a look and then make sure that other the lines get attached to your glove box. Okay. All right, great. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. Bye.
