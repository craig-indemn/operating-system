Hello. Hi. Good afternoon. This is JC with the Lions Insurance. How are you doing today? You look fine. How about yourself? I'm doing well. Thank you so much for asking. I'm sorry to bother you, but I was calling in because we received a notification from Safeco regarding Edward Bacon. I know we've talked to you about this situation previously. And it looks like he unfortunately was added to the policy for the renewal, and I called Safeco. Essentially, they did not receive a signed document stating that Edward is not a member of the household. I've emailed you the documentation needed needed for for us to remove him through email. If you don't mind, just e-signing that and then we can get this issue resolved on our end. So they still have this guy on on our insurance. Well, they're because they didn't receive the signed document. They added him to the renewal, which is in March. So we have time to remove him from the policy. They just need that signed documentation. Okay. So I I need to e-sign the the form stating. Email. Yeah. Yeah, he's just not a member of your household, and then. Absolutely not. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I saw that name. I thought, Who in the world is that? You know. Yeah. I'm going back to my computer right now. Okay. Let me while you're on the phone. Of course. Just let me know when you're. Okay. If it is one thing or something else, you know what I mean. Always yes, I understand. And I type with one finger, so it'll take. No, that's okay. All you need to do is accept, and then it'll ask you for your signature, and I all you have to do is click. Okay. So I got Congress sign. Yes. You document. I'll click on that. Yes, click on that. I just want to make sure I do it right. No, that's okay. I understand. Uh, I got a lot of blank. Oh, there it is. It's finally on the fourth sheet of paper. Okay. Edward Bacon. Yeah. Okay. So I should click agree down here. Correct. I agree. And now let me go to where disclosure. I'll click on signature, and my name just popped up. I'm going to put adopted, and it looks like it should be it. All right. Now all I got to do is close it out. Yes, and then I'll receive it on my end. Okay. Yeah, my name is definitely on there and today's date. All right. Well, I'll tell you what I. Oh, here's a complete signing. Let me just hit that. Okay. That's probably why you didn't get it here. All signatures are complete. Confirm. Exit was sent. Okay, email was sent. All right. That should do it. All right. I'm glad I was home when you called. Me too. I was just going to leave you a lengthy message so you were aware of the situation, but I'm glad you answered. All right. Very good. Thank you so much. Completed. Absolutely, it's my pleasure, Dennis. I hope you have a great rest of your day, and I'll I'll be sending this update. Yeah, you too. We appreciate everything you do. Absolutely, it's our pleasure.
