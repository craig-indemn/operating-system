Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. I'm going to help you. Cecilia. Yes. This is Frederick Johnson. I hope you're doing okay. I'm doing good. How are you? I'm doing okay. We talked a couple of weeks ago. I think about the problem with the cancellation of that Cincinnati insurance policy. Yes, sir. Well, I received Saturday a check in the mail from Cincinnati Insurance Company. For refund of unearned premium. With a letter saying that the policy had been canceled. And I want to make sure. That that policy wasn't canceled. I have not cashed the check. I will return the check or do whatever you tell me to do with that check because as I understood it. That had been straightened out. Yes, sir. I mean, the policy. Yeah, it didn't cancel. It was re. You know, reactivated or the system had to send out notification saying it was reactivated, but. They didn't tell us that they were going to mail out a check. So let me check with the company. You should be good to toss it, but let me check with them and I can give you a callback and let you know. Yeah, I mean I'll be glad to return the check, whatever they want to do with it. I just want to make sure that we do have coverage on that property. Yes, sir. Yep, let me get on the phone with them and I'll give you a callback. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye.
