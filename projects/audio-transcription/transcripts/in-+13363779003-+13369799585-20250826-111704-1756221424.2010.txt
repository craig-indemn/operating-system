Good, good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, ma'am. Good morning. I'm just calling to see if because I called last week to cancel a policy. Auto insurance. So I don't know if they did because the guy he said he will send me a link which I will find but I couldn't open it so I'm just didn't find it. Okay. What name is the policy in? Maria. The Lord is Mar. Okay, there we go. It's auto insurance. Auto insurance. Okay. The auto policy with National General. Yes. Okay. Yeah, it does not look like it's been canceled yet. So give me one moment. Let me see if I can get an agent for you. Thank you. You're welcome.
