Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hey, is Gloria in? Um, I can transfer you over to her extension. Um, you might have to leave her a voice message and she give you a call back. Is that okay? She has she hasn't called me back in two days. This is Don Cuman. I'm calling about my insurance that was canceled. I need to get reinstated. Okay, Don. Um, let me see here. Well, if you want, I can send her a message and um and let her know that you had called in again. Okay. Is there a reason why I'm waiting so long for a response from her? Yeah, I don't know. I'm not really for sure. Maybe she's working on something behind the scenes. I mean, I can't really tell you. But I can definitely tell that you called in and you said you've left several messages and haven't returned it. Right. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.
