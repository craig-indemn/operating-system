Hey Corbin, it's Marcia. How are you doing? Hey, can you hear me, okay? I can hear you. Can you hear me? Yeah, can now. Okay, I am. I am working on this. I know it's. I had to send some more documents now, so hopefully I can get you an answer. It all has. Yeah, because it's the nineteenth and like I cannot like it did go down a little right it was like one thousand something that was going to be charged and now it says it's going to be nine hundred five dollars but what I'm not understanding is why that first payment if it's a six month policy is nine hundred dollars three times more than the other five months which is three oh four. So the whole policy is two thousand four hundred twenty eight dollars and thirty three cents, and so I'm just confused like what's mine the Subaru and me and what's my daughter's portion of that which must be two thirds of it probably one third is mine. And then the thing that also scares me is I saw at the bottom on my account that also on the nineteenth I have automatic you know it's going to be automatically charged my credit card so I'm going to cancel my credit card in a day because I don't want this charge. It says it's going to be charged in addition to the nine hundred five dollars six hundred and ninety six cents for month six. Of this month, so normally I pay eighty nine dollars or whatever, and so now it's gone up to six hundred dollars for that final month. So so those are three separate issues like one is the nine hundred five charge on the first month, two is a six hundred dollars charge so now it's up to you know fifteen hundred dollars coming out on my credit card which like I said I'm not paying I'll cancel my credit card I'll I'll just have to go to somebody else to get insurance because this is crazy. Yeah it's it's it's not giving her driving experience because it's showing that she got her driving driving permit on in two thousand twenty three. I mean her driving, what is that? I'm at the why right now. I'm just trying to remember. Oh. Yeah. Well, I don't know whatever the date for that I sent you. She was sixteen when she got the first, and then you have a provisional one and then you get the regular one. So that's what that's what I need. That's what I'm trying to just need is the driving experience. So the text that you know the one that I have second two thousand twenty three when she got provisional it's provisional on it I don't know if you. Or it says learner's permit. I can't remember. I got my head up. Yeah, I can look. But I feel like. But I feel like she's got two years, right? That's the problem. Uh huh. Um. But let's talk when I get back. I just want you to put if you take a look at that and see if I'm reading that right. That's basically what I'm finding is the driving time. Until twenty one, the provisional the second that's the provisional, but let's go back to the other one. It's this one. It's um. Learner's driver's license was. Yeah, I sent you the driver's learner's permit and then a provisional permit and then the regular one which is the original one that I sent. Yeah, but what are the dates on those? The the date on the her regular one was issued. What's the date issued on twelve ten two thousand twenty three. The provisional one was issued, so it was two thousand twenty three. I guess. Provisional twenty three. No, no, no. That's not not the provisional one. That's the regular one. Yeah, the provisional one was. It's got at least two years. But if you look at the progressive, they're not giving her. They're not really giving her any driving experience. She's kind of a new driver. That's what they're doing. So they have to. So they're going through and looking at that because once you get that fixed, that will not down. Yeah, that's still one. It was two thousand twenty two. February ninth, two thousand twenty two was when she got her provisional driver's license. Okay. Yeah, let's talk about that a little more in the back. But but that's kind of what they're looking at. So. Yeah, because she started driving. To twenty twenty is when she started driving. That's when she got her learner's twenty twenty. I thought there was one I saw in two thousand twenty three. It's provisional, but I guess that's. No, the two thousand twenty two was the provisional two thousand twenty two. February two thousand. Yeah, it's provisional. So that's really her when she started driving. With you know
