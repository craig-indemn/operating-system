Thank you for holding this, Gary. Yes, so Gary, this is John J. O. H. N. Calling on behalf of State Employees Credit Union, I S A. E. Flusher team on a recorded line, and the reason for this call is to obtain the twenty twenty five twenty twenty six policy term for a mutual client. As you get assistance with this. What is the name on the policy? Yes, name of the insured is Abby and Donnie Watkins with the property address one three four five Barker Drive, Randallman, North Carolina two seven three one seven. As N G M Insurance Company, is the current carrier for this one? Is that correct? N G M has non renewed that policy and we have spoken to them about rates for a rewrite and have received no response. So I don't know if they went somewhere else or not. Okay, so technically this policy from N G M Insurance was going to be set to non renew on November twelve twenty twenty five. Is that correct? That's correct. Unless they call us back to place elsewhere. So it's due to rewriting the policy, right? Yes. And they may or may not call us back. Up to this point, they have not called us back. Okay, but any chance if we could able to call back at least on before like on November, seven just to make sure if there any final informations we're getting with us is going to be canceled or rewritten. You can do that, but if we issue a new policy, you guys will get a copy. Perfect. So did I got one Gary? I think I would be off for today. Thank you very much for your assistance. Have a nice day. Have a good bye now.
