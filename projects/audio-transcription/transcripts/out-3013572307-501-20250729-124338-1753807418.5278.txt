Hello. Hi there, Carolyn. Yep. Hi Carolyn, this is Sammy flipping here with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing okay. I am returning a voicemail regarding your auto policy with Progressive. I'll be honest with you, I'm a little confused, but I certainly want to help you fix it if I can. I was listening to your voicemail, so you moved to Florida. And then I'm what I'm confused about is just, was it the North Carolina DMV that's giving you issues, or was the Florida DMV that's giving you issues? Yeah. But I actually called yesterday, so. I'm sorry, the phone connection is is broken. Did you say you got your? Did you find resolution yesterday? Is that what you said? Yeah, I just called Progressive directly. Okay, all right. Is anything anything else I can help you with today? Are you all good? Oh. Okay. Well, I certainly do wish you well, Carolyn. Thanks for coming up. I can help you in the future. Thanks so much. Of course, thank you so much. Bye.
