My name is Heather. Hey Heather, my name is William Wilson, and I got your name from a couple of your customers. My mother, Jackie Shore, and her brother, Joe Tracy. Yeah, yeah, she told me you'd be calling. Yep, and she, I've got a my car policies you're coming due next month. Okay. I wouldn't mind if you could maybe write quote for me on that. Sure. I don't know. Do you do health insurance? We do. We sure do. We write all lines of business, so you know we do. Home auto any personal lines like RVs boats, motorcycles all the personal lines, and then we do commercial. You see on your own business or have rental properties, we do that and then we do life and health. Also, so everything you need, we could definitely cover you for sure. All right. As far as the health insurance, mine is good, but adding my wife to our policy is pretty expensive. So I don't know what what's the best way for you to help us get a quote. Should we come down there and meet or should I send you some documents by email or what do you think is most? Well, for the are you talking about for the health insurance? Either either both. Okay, so now do you guys own your home? Yes. Okay, so I personally would do because I do the personal, I do some commercial. The health insurance is is a different agent that would handle that. So I can get Steve to reach out to you. Okay. Because I don't know what all that really entails, I don't usually mess with the health insurance or. Yeah, I do personal and commercial, but yeah, let me just start with the information that I'm going to get from you for. Do you have any other personal lines as far as home and auto? Do you have a motorcycle or any personal policies besides your homeowners and your auto insurance? Oh yeah, I have seven rental properties and I have. I've got an umbrella policy. You know, I got a lot of stuff. Okay. That sounds great. Right now, I just need I need to look at the auto and the. Um, the help. So. Okay. Do you mind if I quote your homeowners with the auto because so we're an independent broker. We have about 20 carriers, but I will tell you, most of them are going to require multi lines of business. So that's my try to go ahead and quote the home with the auto because you're going to have more options. There, I only have like progressive that's going to do. A monoline auto policy. Does that make sense? It does. Who all insures your properties or home and auto? Okay, that's a good question. The the the auto is all state. Um and I think they have a couple of the rental properties. Okay. Homeowners, I'm going to have to look that up. I'm so sorry I should have had that information right. Oh, you're fine, honey. I know you were just calling to get. Yeah, just get some directions. Auto, I know. Okay. It's just going to be better if we quote it all at one time and not necessarily have to move it, but just we know we'll know more what we're looking at. Gives you more options. Got it. And better. Can email you some information or what's the best way. That would be good. Yes, that would be great. All right, let's do that. Okay, so my email is Heather. H e a t h e r, my last name is Scott, but it's just my initial, so it looks like Heather's. Floral. Oh, okay, so no date. Yeah, Heather's. Okay, Heather's at. And it's going to be my alliance, and that's my from my alliances a l l i a n c e. Insurance and insurance is spelled out. Dot com. Okay. All right. So what kind of stuff should I send you? Current policies on auto. Owner. Yes. Okay. And then if you can include that in the body of the email, like you're, is are you married? Is it you and your wife? Any children driving? No. Okay, so just include the drivers. So it's going to be you and your wife, the names, date of birth, and driver's license number. Uh, and deal number. Okay. And if you've had any claims on home or auto lists, like within the last five years. Okay. And so auto and then on the homeowner send you on the auto and the homeowner send you my current current declaration pages or just the property or okay all right. Yeah, just a deck, just a declaration with all I need. Um and you said it coming up when does it renew the auto I know you said it's coming up I
