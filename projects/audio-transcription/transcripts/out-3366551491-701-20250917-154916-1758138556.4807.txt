Hi there, good afternoon, Leslie. This is just Jeremy giving you a call from Alliance Insurance. Received a message about giving you a call regarding your home and auto quote to take a look at your policy and see what we could do in comparison with some of our other carriers there. Just look a little bit more information. I'll be able to get started on this. I'm going to send you. Excuse me, I'm going to leave my number here that you can get a call back at. I'll be here until five o'clock today. The number's three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. That is three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Look for hearing from me soon. Thank you so much.
