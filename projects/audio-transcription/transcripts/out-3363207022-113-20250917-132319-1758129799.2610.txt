Hello. Hey, Miss Mia Pitchgari at Alliance Insurance. Yes. Okay. Did anybody ever call you because we got a notice from Northwest Farmers that they declined your policy? And this was sent back to me. To help find help you find something else. I'm trying to read the notes here. So just bear with me just a minute. They declined new policy that we were trying to take out. They did. And see we we need to find a replacement. I'm trying to read the notes here to see if I can find out why. If you just bear with me just a minute here. But anyway, I've been in touch with another company. To quote it, and their question was, "What type of a water loss was it that you had recently? " Water. Oh, my grandson had left my my back my water hose. He had when we went to the beach in July. He came home and washed his rod and reels and everything like he always does, and it's got a. A sprayer on the end of the hose. He had accidentally left the water hose on, and that sprayer had a crack in it and we didn't know it, which I mean I didn't know the water hose was on. And it had been leaking for almost a month and I didn't know it. I mean I had no idea. But did y'all turn in a claim for that? No. Well, there's there's seven a claim. Showing a claim out here. Oh golly, that's been years ago. Yeah, you're just exactly what. Behind our refrigerator, the water that goes to the water to the ice maker. The line going to the ice maker. I mean it was minute the hole was you wouldn't believe how little it was. But I did not know that it was leaking back there because I can't pull my refrigerator in and out. It sits back in like a. Space where I can't get it in and out. Um. And it had leaked, and I was coming up from the basement one day and I thought. What in the world is wrong with those boards? They look wet. And when I got to checking into it, that water that ice maker had a pin. I mean. A pin hole, but it had been leaking for quite some time. But. Well, to see if this sounds like to you, it says that the claim is three and a half years old. And that they the amount paid was five thousand dollars. Nationwide paid you five thousand to fix it. Nationwide, I didn't even have Nationwide insurance. Let's see. Of course, now this was this was three years ago, three and a half years ago, and the policy was in Mark's name. But anyway, the bottom line is we just need to know what caused the damage and if you got everything fixed. Oh yeah, I mean everything is fixed. You had to replace flooring and everything. I would imagine. Yeah, we had we had to replace part of the the um. Where it had sprayed and got on the wall and everything. I had to pull out sheetrock and everything. Okay. Well that will help me and I'm I'm still trying to see if I can find out why I see some notes out here but I'm having trouble getting to them. I see. It seems like that they would have sent you a letter or something to let you know what they had done. I've not gotten anything. I mean from saying that it was declined that they declined the policy. It wasn't declined because of payment or anything like that. It was it was just declined after they got it and looked through it. I don't think that they wanted to. You mean if you use your insurance then you can't get insurance again. Well, I'm not going to say that that's why they did it, but I'm I'm trying to find out for sure what they. What they did here, and whoever handled this before didn't leave a whole lot of information out here for me. I'm glad somebody found it because my insurance is going to be coming up. Yeah, it's the 29th. I've already checked that, so we're good on that. If we can find somebody to take it. Let's see. I sent in. I called another company already and they wanted me to check details on that on that damage that you had. So I feel like the way that the way that refrigerator sits. Back in that hole like that, the cabinet comes up one side and the wall comes up the other. And I just I mean I had no idea it was leaking. And by the time I did see it was leak, which y'all have to understand too at the time I was taking I had Mark still here on the end. Right. I understand. I mean that was my 24 hour a day at that time. Because I mean Mark was in bad bad shape. And so
