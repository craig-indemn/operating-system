Thank you for holding, Misses Anna. How can I help you? Hey Anna, this is Lauren Ware. I called yesterday about getting in a commercial auto policy. Yeah. Um, I was calling. I've got to go to the DMV and get a tag, but I have to have the policy information before they'll give me one. Do you have that yet? So I yeah, I was working on it. Give me one second. Let me get that pulled up. Hold on. Okay. Because I um because I just took over your y'all's account. Um, the money is no longer with the company. Um. So I just wanted to make sure that I did quote it correctly because I know you said it was coming off of. Rent care solutions, correct, and going on to the Carolinas Alliance for Residential. Yes. Okay. Who are we listing drivers on this policy? Who let me see the drivers? Um for now, yes, me and let me get the administrator and then we'll need to add a couple people, but I don't have all their information yet. Okay. Well, I can do right now is um because I can send you an email just so that way we can get this um issued and you'll have the information. I do just have you on here right now. Okay. And then I do have the vehicle. Do you know if you guys are still needing that two million single limit or one million? Um. Was was that on the policy here? Correct. Exactly. Yeah, that's what you guys were currently carrying on the rent care solutions. Oh no, they have a different. It's that's in North Carolina. Okay. So you guys don't have that Medicaid Medicaid requirement. Not here. Perfect. Okay, so we um it's currently quoted at two million, so I can change that back for one million. Um. But that's it for now. I do have it. Let me get it pulled up. Um, in order for me to issue it. Do you want to do the monthly payment or we pay in full? Um, it would be. Uh, how much is it if we do monthly? So if you did, so there is a down payment. If you did a down payment today to start the policy, that down payment is one hundred and twenty five dollars and eight cents. Okay. And then the remaining of the monthly payment would be roughly one twenty six one hundred twenty six and ten cents. Per month. Correct. Okay, yeah, that's fine. Okay. So let me get give me one second and then we can get that issued. And then we can I'll email you for all the things we need to update real quick. Give me one second. Sorry. And the number that you call that good contact number for this account. Yes. And do you want to set this up on automatic payment? Um. Yeah. Send bill. Send an auto bill. Okay. Automatic. I think. And I so I think that might be an issue. Um. The Carolinas Alliance has a couple different locations, correct with different policies. Uh yes, this one it's gonna it's well for you it's probably gonna look like new. We we had a policy, the van got totaled, and so for a little while now they've not had a vehicle, so they don't have an actual policy right now. Because they they were without a car and they would not allow us to have a policy without a car. Okay. Because they keep saying Arizona China issued that this customer already has an existing progressive policy. Okay, which name do you have? Um, it was quoted under Carolinas Alliance for Residential Excellent LLC. That's the right one. Yeah, saying it won't let me as the already existing. I I am not aware. Can you look it up to see where there is an existing one? I think it might. Here is what I think. I think the name might be so long that it's thinking that either Elkin or Star are, but. I I don't think that that company should not have a policy because they would they wouldn't we tried to have one. Because we thought we were going to get the car here sooner, but they made us cancel it because they said you can't have a policy without having a car on it. Gotcha. Okay. Um and I don't know if that's true, but that's what they told my home office staff. Okay. Let me um. Let me look into this real quick. Um. Because it gave us the quote, so I am getting look at see the why it didn't go through. Um. So can I can I give me like can I give me like two minutes? I am going to call my um. My manager to see what he thinks the issue is to see if we can get results really quick and then I can call you back. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Okay,
