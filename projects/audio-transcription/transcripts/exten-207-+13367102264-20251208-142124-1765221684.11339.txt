Sorry for your hold. This is Cody. Can I help you? Oh yes, I have a few questions about my policy. Okay, what's your name? Oh, my name is Hector Jimenez. Just a second here. I have my bill in. Help. Give me just a second, Hector. I'm getting it pulled up here. Is this for the Travelers policy or the Westfield policy? Oh, it's the Florida Travelers. Okay. It's that pulled up on their website here. Who are you installing for these days, Hector? Oh, custom builder structure. Okay. You often stay pretty busy before it got too cold. Excuse me. So did you did stay pretty busy this year before it got cold? Yes. All right, I got your policy pulled up here. Hector, are you there? Yes. Um, I said I got your policy pulled up here in their system. What was your question about? Oh well, my question was about uh, I don't really open the envelopes that you guys send me because I have the auto paying. Uh huh. And this Saturday I opened one, and actually I just noticed about my uh. Uh, what's going? The audit. I have to do my I have to complete my audit. Yeah, I see the non compliant audit bill and looks like they just drafted for that too. Yeah, they that's what I was that's what I was asking. I just opened it on on Saturday and that was the day they were they were going to take out the money, but I didn't notice it until that day. Like I said, I don't really open the envelopes because I have the auto pay. Uh huh. Uh, so I was just wondering about that. So whenever I complete my uh the audit, uh, will they give me that money back? They will. So the non compliant audit fee. So if you don't do your audit in time, then they hit you with that non compliant audit fee. But once you complete your audit, then they will refund you that. Fee that they charged you, and then they will just handle it based on the amount of payroll you had like a normal audit. Okay, okay, and I already spoke to a lady and she was going to send me the the things that I had to send to complete my audit. Uh huh. Uh, I was just wondering if you can just send it again because I haven't checked but just in case I didn't get them. Yep, give me just a second here. I'm going to print out this form here and then I can send it over to you. Yeah, and that was totally my bad because I I usually just check my bank account and see if they check out the money and I check every month and they usually I mean they they do check it out but I never thought about the audit I started to forget about that. Right. Um. Let's see. And your email is still Hector dot Jimenez ninety seven at iCloud. Yes. Ninety seven at iCloud dot com. All right, I'm going to email this over to you right now, Hector. That way you have that. It's got a phone number and an email address for them on there. If you need to reach out to them, it lists. You know some of the information that you'll need on this letter as well. Um, but once you get you know your payroll documents and tax documents and stuff together, then you can get that audit completed and get that fee reversed. Okay. Okay, and I was just wondering. So I'm still covered, right? I still have my insurance. Yes, yes. So your workers' comp policy is still active and so is the Westfield package policy too. Okay, so I should be good for the. I mean because I'm going to complete this audit in these days, so it should be completed by maybe like a Wednesday or probably Thursday. But yeah, it won't be more than this week until I complete the audit. Okay, that sounds good. Yeah, just get everything over to them and then once they get it completed, then they will reverse that fee. And get that sorted out for you. Okay. Okay, okay. And what about the what about my insurance? So I'm still covered for one more year. Yeah, so your policy's renewed September the eighth is when they renewed and yeah they covered until September the eighth of 26. Okay, all right then. Thank you so much, man. I will take care of that audit. I appreciate that. All right, thank you, man. Have a good day. You're super.
