Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Hey Heather, my name is Chelsea Grease. I would refer to you guys to maybe reach out and get a quote for what y'all was charged me on insurance premium for twenty twenty two Dodge Charger. Okay, so you're not insured with us. No ma'am, I'm not. Okay, who are you currently insured with? Farm Bureau. All right. Did they have your home and auto? Yes, I do. All right, is that something you're interested in? Because we don't, we're not doing just the auto policies. We're bundling packages, so we would need to quote home and auto together. I don't have a carrier that would just write just the auto. Okay. Um. I don't know. I would have to go home and look at my homeowners. The only reason I chose Farm Bureau is because they had the best homeowners. And I've been with them since I was sixteen years old. Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, you know, I'd love to quote it. Um, but like I said, we would have to quote it the home and auto together. We couldn't just take the auto. Okay. All right. Well, thank you. Absolutely. Have a good one.
