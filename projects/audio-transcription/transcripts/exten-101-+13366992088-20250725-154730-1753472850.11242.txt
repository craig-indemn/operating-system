I've got an employee that has fell through a porch this afternoon. Oh no. It's his leg up. Now he's coming here to tell me that it feels numb and that he can't feel it. Do I just send him to the the emergency room and how do they file this on workers comp? I mean advise me. Okay, I guess what I'm advising me. Yes, so yeah, you need to tell him to go ahead and go to the um go to the doctors and get seen. Okay. And um yeah we could we could go ahead and file a claim on a workers comp so that you know whatever happens you know going forward would kind of be taken care of. Okay. Give him some information. Tell him, it will be filed soon. Yeah, yeah, you'll have to. You'll need to give him a little bit of information. Um, so need to let him know that he got and got hurt on the job and kind of give the company name. I believe he'll just kind of need the company name and a policy number and I think he'll kind of the. So I'll use this policy number. This one zero zero zero nine zero four nine six eight zero. I mean make sure okay I've never used y'all so I don't know exactly what I need to use with y'all I get I get confused Amani I'm sorry. Yes, all right.

It looks like it's great, but now he says he can't feel it. So we're not taking any chances. Yeah, yeah, definitely don't want someone like that. What's his what's his name? Trevor.
