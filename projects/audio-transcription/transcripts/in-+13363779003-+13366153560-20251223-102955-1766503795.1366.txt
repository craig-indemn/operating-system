Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. I'm at. I hope you. Hey, how you doing today? I'm good. How about you? I'm okay. Um, I called to pay my auto owner's insurance. Um, is there anybody available I can talk to? Give me one sec to pull you up. So it looks like your HO renters insurance that you have to list. Um, there's still no payment due. The next bill comes out the 29th of December. So I cannot make a payment now. Um, one sec. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance Services. We appreciate your patience, and we will be with you shortly. While you wait, please take a moment to think of any recent changes to your personal or contact information. This helps us serve you better. Did you know you can manage your policy? So it's not going to allow me just due to the fact that it's not the next bill time yet and I um since it's for the renewal of the insurance you already had for next this is for next year it's not going to allow me to pull it up to take a card payment. Okay, so like when's the best time for me to call? Around the next bill date. Okay, so the 15. So the next bill comes out the 29th of December. Okay. Okay, thank you. Have a good day.
