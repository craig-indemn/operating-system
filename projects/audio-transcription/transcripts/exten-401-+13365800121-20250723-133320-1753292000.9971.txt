No. Oh, I just well make sure you got it because I just didn't. That's crazy. I thought that's why you were calling me. I'm gonna make sure. Yeah, so I didn't have the right. Hold on a second. Like I didn't have. Yeah, it's still not. Hold on. It's jredwine2020atoutlook.com. Yes, jredwine2020atoutlook.com. Yeah. Okay, hang on a second. That's funny. I'm glad you called because I was just about to make sure if you did get it. Yeah, my mother's yard this morning. They came home mowed my yard. So that's all I've been doing all day. I hadn't even been out of the office today. I got here this morning. Is it still hot? It was nice this morning. When I started at little four eight, but they got hot by one o'clock. Yeah, I'm resending it right now. I do need because I have I've got you a package and it includes the home, the autos and your an umbrella policy. I can't remember if you had an umbrella. If you told me that you I just quoted one. Because you carry higher limits, so I figured you did. But I have got you a package here. But I would need your you and your wife's driver's license number. I never got that either. I think mine is. I think my number is five three eight sixteen twenty one. Number. Hold on a second one. Yours is five three eight. Yeah, sixteen twenty one. Sixteen. I think in our auto is with Progressive right now. It comes due in September. I think. You told me September 10th on the auto. Yes, that's correct. But of course you know we would like to package it. Do you know how much yours is? I already paid for. I already paid for. I got to look. That's fine. That's right. I didn't notice you off the top of your head. What is your email? For me, I put that in here and make sure. Yeah, it's Heather S. At my allianceinsurance.com. Yeah, make sure yours mine's not going through spam. Is that what you're doing? You're such in my Majesty. We haven't seen. You just came in. Got it. Okay. Okay, I've got a lot of questions. Yeah, if they came to closing till next Thursday, the 31st. Oh, okay. So I did. I don't think I've got to use since I talked to the the HOA. She emailed me everything. She emailed me the bylaws and the master policy, and then she also confirmed John that you do need a true homeowner's policy, not the condo unit. Like that's the um, the content only you're from Studden. You you are responsible for the outside as well. Okay, can you send me those forms that she sent you? Absolutely. Yes. Yeah. Okay, let me look at not a business executive umbrella premium homeowners. 1000 sixty payment full premium eight nine. First auto. That's my premium. Now that all those are for an annual premium. The Progressive your auto Progressive is it six months. What's that? Is your policy your auto policy with Progressive? I think it is. I think it is six months. Usually they offer you six months. So just keep in mind that the that's a 12 month. Yeah. For all three, it's it's the annual policy for all three. We don't write six month policies. Right. Okay. And you guys were recommended to me by my oldest insurance agent Chris Bond. I guess he retired. Yeah. Yeah. He told me to call somebody then they transfer me to you. I am trying to I'm going to have to go back through my emails as well and find those. Follow. Okay. No, I'll forward them right over to you. But she her name was Nancy. I'm trying to think of her name because I can search my email. That's what we just kept waiting for her to confirm, and she did send. It's called the trellises. The trellises is the okay yes. That that's the lady I was working with, and like I said, I didn't want to quote an HO six policy which is like the contents or some Studden like a condo unit. Until I heard from her, so a lot of times I'll get people calling me. That's when you purchase. They're like, "I just need, I just I think so. I think uh on my the old Camry we don't you don't have just in just the basic insurance and Lexus we have. Let me go back in and make sure I quoted it like that then. And it's not necessary to take that policy. I always provide it whenever I'm quoting your home and auto, especially if you carry the higher limits. I just go ahead and present you a proposal for the um. The liability is protecting you your assets. See, so what do you say on the Camry? The Toyota Camry is 2009. I just have the basic insurance. I don't have. Okay, let me see. Yeah, I quoted it full coverage on that one. So you only have liability. On the Camry. Yeah, so let me. So that will change. Okay, let me tell you what the new premium will be. Do you carry um? Do you have AAA or do you carry roadside assistance or rental expense? Any of that? On each one. No, I don't have AAA. No. You don't have AAA, so you have roadside assistance towing and all that stuff on your policy. I think so. Yes. Okay, all right. And rental do you need rental coverage? Yeah, I probably need them. You do. Yeah okay. I have it on there. Okay. Yeah. And your deductibles are 100 500. On the the Lexus, yeah, 100 for comprehensive and five for collision. Yes. That right. Okay. I've got rental coverage on there as well. Yeah, I've been renting a car in October, so I'll need that. So you would be covered on that one. You wouldn't need to purchase. You know how when you rent one, they want to try and sell you another policy. You wouldn't need it because it's on here. So do you can you get me your um I'm not going to run these reports. Can you get me your wife's license driver's license number? Yeah, she's downstairs. Let me get it. Okay, all right. I'm going to go ahead and put yours in here. See. It's at 5381621 is yours. Just bringing it up now. Okay. Yeah, and then I'll get you a true and accurate quote. I couldn't. That's just a general. Have y'all had any tickets for accidents? Nothing good. Okay, my number just confirming is was a bunch of zeros in front of it one two three four. And then it's 5381621. Got it. Two three four five zeros in front. Yes, it does. Yeah, they all do. You can just start with the numbers after that. So that's is 2964059. Okay. Thank you. And Ford, they felt yesterday changed our close out date from the 30th. Wednesday till Thursday, the 31st. So when can I call you and give you my credit card number to pay this homeowner's insurance? Any time between now and then. And we could start on that. Yeah, it would start on your closing date. Yeah. Okay. It's 895 dollars. Yeah, hang on one second. Let's see. I'm running a report now on the um. Your MBR. And then I removed the cop and collision off of the Camry, right? Yes, you don't need comprehensive or collision on the Camry. Just the basics. You're so old. I left liability on there and I left the towing like roadside assistance if you break down. And then you have the rental coverage on the Lexus, and then like I said, you've got rented coverage for your rented vehicles when you go travel out of town if you're renting. Okay. So after running that report, and you would pay that in full. Is that right for the year the auto too? Yeah, I will pay in September. Yeah. Um. It's it's 120453 if you pay in full for six for for 12 months. 120453. Yeah, that's. I'm sorry. Okay. And let me change the date on that. So you said September 10th is your renewal date. Are you sure? Yeah, let me make sure. Yeah, because I don't want to have a lapse in coverage. Rest of auto insurance September 10th 2024 March 10th 2025. Yeah, you got it. March 10th and September 10th. Okay, all right. Good deal. So I will. I don't mean I don't that start September 10th or it ends on September 10th. I don't know what you want it is. Yeah So what did you end up doing with the home? As far as the insurance, did you did you pay like monthly or are you just monthly and monthly? Gosh, it's a good deal. That's what I thought. I thought that would be the best thing to do. Okay, that's good. All right, yeah. Um, are you do you have any questions about the coverage on the home? No, I'll go read through one more time later on today. I'm probably not. Okay. Yeah, we're insuring it for four hundred and twenty-seven thousand four hundred. Again, the bylaws according to the bylaws project and the master policy, and the trellises AOA Nancy. They are she says you do you are responsible for the outside. Um. So with that, we run the replacement cost estimator, which says it's um in order to cover it, um a replacement cost. It you know it it burned down completely. They're saying it would cost four hundred and twenty-seven thousand four hundred dollars to rebuild it just the way it is. Okay. With that, we also have an additional twenty-five percent on there of coverage. So the way inflation is right now, say six months from now, that replacement cost changed. And now they're saying it's five hundred thousand to rebuild. Um and you have a total loss six months from now you know that you have the added the additional twenty-five percent of the dwelling amount at four twenty-seven four so that'll give you some additional there. Okay. If it's if it's a total loss. Um. We we have a deductible on there at twenty-five hundred. Are you okay with that? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, all right. We used to quote a thousand dollar deductibles on all these homeowners. The trend now, like I said with inflation and the replacement cost, just going up and up and up. Um, it just makes sense to quote it at twenty-five hundred. Right. You know before if your home was like three hundred thousand or two hundred thousand a thousand would be would be better but now that these rates have increased we're doing twenty-five hundred. Um. That's that's what we're quoting it like we're seeing it quote but of course if you want to adjust those you can definitely do that. Okay. Um. Let's see what else we got here. Do you mind doing a self inspection? Or do you want the company to come out? I'm sorry. To a new place. Yeah. Yeah, we just we got we paid five hundred dollars for getting inspected. Well, so when you write a new policy, the carrier like auto owners is going to come out and do an inspection. And it's not like an inspection like what you just paid to have done it's just they're coming out they're walking around the property making sure there's no hazards, you know everything looks good there's no cracking in the foundation. The roof looks good things like that. Yeah. There's nothing that needs to be replaced or repaired. There's no trees overhanging. You know or touching the roof. Those are just the basic things we're looking for, but you can actually do it yourself if you feel comfortable doing that and it's very easy to do. Yeah, I mind doing it. Okay. All right. So they're going to send you a link once we bind the policy and it becomes active. Um, auto owners will send you a link, and it's going to be to your phone and you'll just click on that link and it'll open up this app and. It's going to tell you exactly where the safety code is and pretty much it's just like on each four corners of the home right. Well, you're in a town home so it will be yeah but like I said they're just pretty much wanting to see that the roof looks good. Um. There's nothing no kind of hazards going on or anything like that. Yeah, HOA. I could get understanding that HOA because uh so we're paying for the insurance like for the roof and stuff and outside but like they just fix three things on the roof in the top. Yeah, I don't know what they fixed it. I don't understand that. Well, they they have a so that's what I'm saying they have a master policy. Yeah. Um. And it covered the master policy covers each home right. I mean it's like a a cluster of homes but that's what the master policy does for them. Um, if something happens like to the roof like if there's a storm, then that master policy that they have in place should should repair that but then you have assessments that you have to pay right and sometimes they increase the assessments to to. To pick up the cost of their deductible or whatever or just you know to to make these small repairs so. Um, but it's not going to it's not enough coverage for you to cover the Visa. All right, get over my head with the card number. Four four zero zero six six five four zero six eight eight one zero six eight. And the date date is twelve twenty eight. And the code is zero. I don't need that. I do need the you said the address is your car address is that right? Yeah. Of your. Fifty. Yeah, forty five Rocky Springs Court. Fifty forty five Rocky Springs Court. What's that? Okay. Yep. Two seven two eight four. Okay. Okay, it is going to be your card will be ran for nine hundred fifty nine dollars. Okay. Okay. Yep. So you'll get another email with your receipt. We're gonna get a couple emails. But hey, that's one thing you can check off the box. Yeah. Like utilities, they got water, sewer, electricity, all in city of high points. I guess I should call the number for that. And gas and telephone, TV. Okay, got another email. Set it's paid. Yeah, that is here with receipt. All right, so we are good for now. Like said, you can call me back anytime between now and September tenth. Okay. What is the same for the auto? Just make sure you don't pay progressive. Oh, I will not pay progressive. Boy. You can call them if you want and just say, "Hey, I am going to send in my renewal," and they'll take care of that for you. You won't get any melons, but yeah, just um. I know you are going to be busy, and I can set myself a task to follow up with you between now and then. If you want me to, you just let me know. Um. You know when you want to do that. That was the taking pictures of the house. He said. No for the auto insurance. Oh yeah yeah anytime. I should be finished by end of all this insurance all all this stuff. How about I just call you around? Let's see, let me look at my calendar. Because like said, I know you are going to be busy and you are probably not going to think about it. Um. So I am looking. So you live in next Thursday. I'll call you that next week, like August the sixth. That sounds okay. And what are we doing then? That's pretty early. Auto policy. Yeah. I thought I thought we'd do September tenth. Oh September yes I am sorry gosh you are right. Yeah I'll go fix my birthday. That is that's right I told you that my son's birthday is August sixth that's why I was looking at I was like I can remember this date.
