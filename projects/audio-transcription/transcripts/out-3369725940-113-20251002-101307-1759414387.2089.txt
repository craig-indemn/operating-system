Hello. And Miss Adams, it's Gary. How are you? Hey Gary, how are you? I'm doing well. I'm looking at this right now and I do not see that. See that bill out out here anywhere. Sixteen dollars and something. I do not see it. I do not. Hold on, let me look at my bank thing. Okay, it was done on October the first. National General, sixteen dollars. Well, if it was done yesterday, it's probably not updated in this system, but I do not see that out there. Why would they need sixteen dollars? That's that's what we need to wait and see what what it was for. Because I'm showing the numbers that I had given you before. Uh huh. And you're on the auto payment schedule. And the last payment that I'm showing received on this that I'm looking at is September the twenty second. And that was for four hundred and something wasn't it. It was for three ninety five, three ninety five and seventeen cents. Look, it's supposed to be that much. Was that what you told me? I thought it was more than that. That was that was the payment for. Let's see. See when that one was due. Just bear with me here just a minute and let me look at that. No problem. It looks like that that was the initial down payment to start the renewal for October the first. Now your next your next drafts showing for the remainder of the year. Are three thirteen fifty five. A month. Yes, and that's set to come out on the twenty first of every month. Okay, three thirteen. Yes, ma'am. And that's as bad as it was. My husband on there is it. No, no. Of course, you know everything changed first of the month because the renewals and everything the state increased some charges. Maybe that's what it is. Maybe that's why they. It could be that, but I don't see I don't see it in the history here. So okay, well call me one day tomorrow if you find out or one day next week. I'll check I'll check it again here in the next day or two. And see what it is specifically. I hate to speculate on what it might be until I can actually see what it is. Okay. Okay. Thank you for calling. I appreciate it. Hey, you're very welcome. Have a good day. Bye bye. Bye bye.
