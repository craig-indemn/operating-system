Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Hey, this is Deborah Wellborn. How are you? Hey Deborah, I am good. How are you, hun? I just got your picture at home. I am. Yeah, I am in the office. I just got your voicemail. Okay, I am getting ready to leave at one thirty. I need to take a neighbor from church to the doctor's office, and I thought I'd take a chance to see if I just call you in. I just sent you a text. She went from E. Renters. Okay, I've never heard of E Renters. I am not either. Right one, we but I don't know much about. Um and I want to make sure I have her name spelled correctly because like I said when I search for her I put I think with a C and then I spelled it differently. Yes. Okay. It all right. K. K. A. T. H. R. Y. N. E. K. A. T. H. R. Y. N. E. Okay. Well, the L B O R M. Okay, and it's Catherine J. Wellborn. Yes, it is. Okay, and then I have forty seven fifty five Country Club Road. That's still right. Correct. She's still in in the apartment. No, I don't know if it needs to have the apartment number on it or not. Yes, if that the she gets mail there. Apartment one one four C. She gets okay. You know. She gets almost all of her things online. She does have a mailbox there, but. Okay. Mostly, it's just spam mail because she does most of her things online. So it's four seven five five Country Club Road, Apartment One One Four C. Let me add that in there. Apartment. Okay. One one four C. One one. Four C. Four C. Correct. See, then Charlie. Correct. Okay, apartment one fourteen C. Winston say one two zero one zero. Yeah, I just want to add that in there, and then what's a good email for her? Do you know her email? I do. It's just okay. It's Katie Wellborn and it's spelled K A T Y E. Okay. At gmail dot com. All right. And does she want to go ahead and start these today for one nineteen? Okay, so is the one nineteen including the renters insurance? Oh yes, I am sorry. Yeah, I meant one nineteen today's date is. Are we going to make these both effective today, hun? I am sorry. Okay, so. She's a teacher. She gets paid at the end of the month, so she likes to have this drafted out. Man, I bet she's off today, but she's probably not home right now. She'd like to have this drafted out. After she gets paid, like around the fourth or fifth of the month each month. Okay. Yeah, we can do that. I probably should have her call you. She's got she's not home right this minute, but she'll be home in a little bit. But I thought, okay, so with the renter insurance, it was one nineteen or something, but if the renters insurance was paid up front, then that made the insurance ninety nine dollars. Correct. That's right. Okay, so I think it's a little bit less. Hold on, then. Okay. One time you said seventy nine and one time you said ninety nine and I wasn't sure. Yeah, I see the reports were ran. I think it did go up to ninety nine for the auto. That was the auto policy. For a month, which is still a lot better than what she would pay in two fifty. I know. Yes, so and then that the renters insurance is we're going to do it at twenty thousand for her personal property. That's right, and then I've got twenty thousand on that the personal property. I've got five hundred thousand liability and then a thousand dollar deductible and five thousand medical payments. So now does she have to have someone listed as like the property management company on here? I don't know if said field departments is. I'll put those on there. All right, just in case. Like as the property management company. Yes. Okay. I mean that's the apartment she's in, so I am assuming. What is the number that like if I were to have her to call you that she can call you directly. She can call me directly on that. My cell. No, she can call me on my cell. The one you just left a message on or text. Yeah. Would you tell me that again? I am on my computer and I'll be. It's three three six. Three three six nine zero nine. Zero six four five. Zero six four five. Okay. So yes, go ahead and look
