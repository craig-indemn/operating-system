Sorry for your hole. This is Cody Malkey. Hey Cody, this is German. I'm just calling you back. No, what was that? Good, good. I don't think it is. I'm driving and I'm out of the country. In I don't got good service. And literally when you call me, I was like in the middle of mountains. Like there's no service. I said, well, hopefully that don't cut it off. And that was the first thing that happened. Where are you at? Yeah, Mexico. Okay, visiting family. Yeah. Yes. Good deal. Yep. So if you can tell me a little bit about why you was trying to play into me and hopefully we don't lose service and if if it does probably I might I might call you Monday or something. Gotcha. Give me a second here. So they just confirmed that they've added that Escalade to the policy. Okay. So that's good to go. So I talked to Westfield and I basically asked them if they would because they were non renewing your whole policy and you know your losses that you've had were all on the business auto. So I asked them if they would just non renew the auto portion and keep the rest of it and they did agree to do that but I need to get some updated sales figures and stuff like that to them. Okay. They're working on a whole new quote basically since they non renewed that other policy with the business auto. Okay. So they're working on a new quote basically and so we need to get them some updated figures to make sure we got everything correct on there okay. Okay. Okay. Give me just a second here. And then we'll just have to look for business auto coverage somewhere else, of course. With your claims, it's going to make it much harder and obviously be more expensive because it's just going to be harder to find. It's just going to be harder to find coverage when you have a have a big claim like that. Um. Give me a second here. I'm trying to get to. Um. See. So they are wanting to know. So we've got the 150, 000 payroll for the one crew that you're running under the installation class code. How much sales are you? Because right now we have 452, 000 in subcontractor payroll, which is your installer subs. Uh huh. Is that still pretty accurate? About 450, 000 a year. Yeah, it's going to be about about that. It's going to be yeah. We have the same installers basically. So I don't. The only one we added it was the new crew, but basically it's about the same. So. So you. Well, how many other crews are you running besides yours? Like three or something. Two or three. Yeah, that's not three. Okay. I think I think there's yeah. So the amount of sales that we have on the policy is only around 600, 000, which I think that that's got to be low based on how much payroll you have for your subs. How much payroll? I mean, how much sales are you doing a year now? Is it over a million yet? Ah. Probably about that. About a million. Okay. Yep. I would think it would have to be at least that based on how much payroll you have for your your install your installer. So we need to update that and let's see what questions that she had here. Where is her email? Just a second here. My this email is slipping through the cracks here. I think the GL exposures were the only. She was really wanting. Let me just make sure here. Yeah, I think that's all she needs. So just leave the subcontractor payroll at 400, 000. And then increase the sales to 1 million. And then obviously just keep the 150, 000 in installation for your internal crew. Okay. I'll get those. I'll get those numbers over to her and to the underwriter so they can finish working on that that new quote for you and then we'll keep working on the business auto and see what we can come up with on that okay. Okay, sounds good, Cody. Just just let me know and we can go from there. I will do it. Thank you so much. Enjoy your trip. Thank you. Alright.
