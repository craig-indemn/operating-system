Hey Mike, this is Corbin. Just calling you back. They're still running the numbers; they're taking forever. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize it would take two weeks. But with this risk, they said it's normal to take two weeks to quote it. But usually it takes us three to four days at the most. So hang tight. I should. As soon as I hear something, I'll let you know. But I just want to give you a quick update. Call me if you have any questions. Thanks. Bye bye.
