Hello. Hi, Jeff. Yeah. This is Maria with Alliance Insurance. I was trying to reach back to you, Amanda. Let you know I'd worked on those auto quotes and quoting the dwelling. To try to lower the premium on it, and I have those ready. Do you have a few minutes? Okay. I sure do. Okay. Well, first of all, quoting the mobile home, bringing the dwelling coverage down to one hundred thousand, we can do that and it will lower that premium from twenty two. Thirty nine for the year to sixteen forty eight, which will save you about five hundred ninety one dollars. But we will have to do a whole new replacement cost estimator. For the dwelling before we can make that change, but if you like for us to go ahead and do so, we can. Yeah, I would actually. Yeah. Okay, and then also on the autos. I know you said that you currently have it with Nat General National General. When does that come up for renewal? Do you know? Do it. Mandy usually handles everything. I am shining a dark on most of this. If I am mistaken, it it hasn't been like a couple months since it renewed. Okay, so we could do possibly an agent of record where we could be the agent for those policies and help you know maybe combine. Look at some combining those with what you have in place now, but it looks like the closest we got. Ah, was around thirty seven hundred for the year. On all the vehicles, yeah, and I don't know what you are currently paying. She had it written down somewhere because she knew I was going to have to answer these questions. Okay, that's all right. When we can check. Yeah. I know she wrote it down on the paper for me, but I don't even know if we brought it with us. Is there any way I could have her call you back? Are you going to be in office for a while? Sure will. Absolutely. Okay. Can I have her call you back on this night? Yeah, absolutely. Just go to Maria. I might go and say, "Yeah, that's a great deal," and then she goes, "You dummy." Not a problem. Just tell her to give me a call back. I'll go over it with her. Okay, Maria. Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you, bye bye. Alright, bye bye.
