Thank you for calling Auto Owners Insurance. My name is Madison. How can I help you? Hi, yes, my name is Brandy with Alliance Insurance, and I was trying to get a policy put on Auto Pay. Okay, um, is that going to be with a card or banking information? It is going to be. Give me one second. Well, I do believe it was with a card. I had made the initial payment online, and I clicked to save the card. But whenever I'm on the main screen to turn on Auto Pay, it's not there. Yeah, so if you made it online through like our Pay Now system, that is a different system than what we have here in billing. That's through PNC, so it's not going to be saved. It's just going to be saved on the online portal. But if you're looking to use a card, you will need to I need to get you transferred over to our secure credit card line so they can go ahead and turn Auto Pay on for you. Okay. Okay, thank you.
