Thank you for patience, Ho, and this is Marnie speaking. Marnie, this is Dale Powell with Sir John Hill. Hey, how you doing? Yeah, we were talking last week about the property insurance. And you guys had offered the honeycomb as an alternative. And it turns out honeycomb does not want to do business with us. Oh really? What happened? On their application, it says, "Do you have any aluminum wiring in your buildings?" Because they were built in 1973. And so when I answered yes on that, then they said, "Forget it, we're out, no deal." Oh wow. So so which so you guys do have buildings that have that in there? Yes. Okay. Well, I mean they okay here's what I know. They were built with that in the seven in 1973. Yeah. You guys just had it hasn't been updated. Over 50 years, most every unit has been updated. So you know most everybody has. Had some kind of remodeling, some people would have gotten rid of it. But some people may still have original. Who knows what the the mix is? Yeah, got you. But it's still. You're saying that some it some it still exists is what you're saying a percentage. In general, yes, yep. So um. So that puts us back with Westfield. Okay. And then Westfield has the wind and hail. One percent wind and hail. So that means we'd have to add another. Well, I'm asking you a question. Does that mean we would have to add? Another 9, 000 on top of Westfield in order to. Get the deductible down on wind and hail. So I'm going to be honest. I would actually have to inquire back with that because that that buyback is not based off of the Westfield proposal. So it was based off the honeycomb. So I would actually have to ask them and kind of see. You know would it be the same pricing? Would it be higher? Would it be less? But I would definitely say would be you know somewhere in that area because that would be a completely separate separate policy from the Westfield policy. Okay, today is the 19th and the policy expires on the 20th. So we got to figure out something today. Yeah. Well, I mean the policy is already it automatically renews. It doesn't. We don't have to tell it to go go ahead. We just have to tell it not to if we're not going to renew it. So it's. That coverage is going to keep rolling with Westfield. Regardless either way, but I can definitely try to make sure that I try to get an answer back today so that we can know where we're going. You know within the next year or this next year. So I ask okay so. You've already confirmed that there's a one percent deductible on hail and wind damage. Yeah. And so now the only question remaining is. Could Westfield help us with a lower deductible? For an extra fee. Yes, sir. And I'll get that. I'll go ahead and look into that right now and get back to you as soon as I can. Okay, thank you much. Talk to you later today then. Bye. Bye.
