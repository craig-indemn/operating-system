I'll be able to reach out to you the next 24 hours. If you need immediate assistance, please click zero so you can be transferred into one of my other customers. Thank you. Hey Joseph, good afternoon. My name's Jeff Edmonds with Alliance Insurance Services in North Carolina. It is Wednesday, December 10th, about 4:45 p.m. Hope you're doing well today. Calling on behalf of our customer Pine Hill Farm Supply, they were involved. One of your insureds, an Armenta Alvarado Cristobal, did damage to their sign with his vehicle. Date of loss was November the 15th of 2025. Claim number is 250944511. And the insureds Pine Hill Farm Supply and Scott Mosley, Gray. I'm sorry Scott Bruner and Gray Bruner had spoken to you about paying for damage sustained to their sign. I think roughly $1, 500. They reached out to me this morning said they had tried to contact you several times in the last couple of weeks, and they need a response back from you. I think you had agreed to pay for their sign. If you would please you can give me a call back at 336-377-9003, or you can call Scott Bruner at Pine Hill Farm Supply. His number is 336-374-8339. And as your voice mail message stated, we would appreciate a call back within the next 24 hours so that they can go ahead and get this resolved. We appreciate your assistance with this. Look forward to hearing back from you. Bye bye.
