Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Yes, good afternoon. I would like to notify that, um, the mortgage my mortgage insurance was um, the mortgage was uh, transferred to another mortgage, the loan mortgage. And because I have an escrow, I would like to, let you be aware about it. Yeah, absolutely. Um, do you have the letter that it shows on there? What the mortgagee clause needs to read. The updated information. Yes. Okay, all right. Is there? Can I give you an email address to send that to, and then our agent can update it. Okay. Yeah. Hmm. Yes. Yeah, I can do that. I think. Okay. Yes. And let me give you the email address because this goes directly to an agent and. If you send it, it's easier that way. That way they can see exactly how it needs to read to update your policy, and then if they need to send. Um, you know the updated policy to the new mortgage company. They can do that as well. It should all be in that one letter. Okay. Okay, sounds good. And I'll like and just go. Yeah, go ahead. I will. So the email address um is it's support s u p p o r t. At my allianceinsurance dot com. Okay. And to whom I have to address this? To my concern or. Um. Yeah, it doesn't. It it goes directly to an agent. Um. So you don't have to address uh you know put it to anyone specific. Okay. Yeah. And then if you want. It's just a welcoming, right?
