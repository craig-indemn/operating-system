Hello. Hey Gregory, it's Gary at Alliance Insurance. How you doing? Yes, good. How you doing? I'm doing well. Is it a good time for you to talk for just a minute? Yes. Okay, what we're doing is conducting our reviews on your policies. We try to do that at the end of the year. And I just need to make sure that all the vehicle information's correct, which I got the Silverado on there. Is that still the only thing you have? Yes. Okay, and how are you? Are you still using it the same way? Yeah, not often at all. Okay, so it's just a personal use plan. Yes. Okay, so we don't need any changes. It looks like that your liability coverage is pretty good. The let's see, property damage coverage, and that's the coverage if you were to hit somebody else. The property damage coverage on the liability is only at fifty thousand. And I just want want to remind you that if you were to have an at fault and hit one of these new vehicles out here, you may not have enough coverage on the policy to cover it. Right. So just think about. They're supposed to have comprehensive on it to cover like a deer or anything comes out. You do, you do. I was going to get that in just a minute. You have a 500 deductible on the comprehensive. Yeah. So if you hit a deer or something, yes, it would be covered, but you would be subject to that 500 deductible. Right. Now let me say this on the liability part: you can increase that fifty thousand to a hundred thousand, and it's just a few dollars. It's it's not real expensive to do that at all. So you can think about that and let let us know if you'd like to increase that or not. Oh, the phone has come by. You can call us and we can increase it right over the phone if you decide to do it. But you know I'm looking at some of the prices on some of these new vehicles. If you were to have something happen, you definitely want to make sure you got enough coverage on there so they don't get in your pocket over it. Okay. Right, right. How much you say go up? It would probably change it maybe maybe twenty dollars a year, and that's it. Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, if you run the numbers for sure, I mean, I'll do it, but I just want to. If you've got time to stay on the phone, I can tell you. All right. Let's see if I can get it done real quick. Now you guys rent or do you own your home? Own the home. Who do you have it insured with? It's with Farm Bureau, but. Do you know when it comes out for renewal? It's up now. Let's see. Let me make an note here. Well, I mean, can you cancel your homeowners anytime, but you have to wait a whole year to do it. Yeah, you can do it at any time without penalty, but we want to make sure we can get you get your rate. That's going to be comparable or less than what you've got. Right. Yeah, it's like twelve hundred dollars a year. Yeah, you know how much coverage you've got on there. I don't, but I can find out and get it to you. Yeah, that that might be good. Get one of them sheets, print it off so you can go through it. Yeah, yeah, you can you can get that, or you can get the sheet and call me back. I'm getting there. Just bear with me just a minute here. If you bump that up, it's only going to add five dollars and seventy three cents to your coverage, and that will carry you that will carry no not a month that's for the whole term. So it will carry you to the end. Let's see. August of. Twenty six. All right. Go ahead and go with that. Yeah, it'd be well worth it if you did that. Yeah, yeah. Um and then if you get the homeowner's information for me, then I can run you some rates on that to see if we can do any better than Farm Bureau is doing for you. Yeah, because it averages out about a hundred some dollars a month. And you you pay that yourself or do you? Yeah, I pay it myself. Okay, I pay it myself. Okay
