Thank you for patiently holding. This is a morning speaker. Good morning. This is Elaine Chandler. How are you? I'm doing good. How are you doing? I'm good. Are you glad it's Friday? Yeah, I am. Too bad it's not Friday at five. Right. Well, we're going to get there at some point. We have bought a new piece of equipment, and I need coverage on it. And I don't know if it's something that can be added to. Our existing policy of some other equipment like with the. Lift or if it needs to be a separate policy because we've got coverage on a skid steer. The lift is on a no. The lift is on a separate policy because of the height or something on it. We've got the skid steer and all that also on another policy. So I mean I can just tell you what we've got and then you can see where it needs to go or if it needs to be a separate new policy or what we need. But I need but I need coverage today because we bought it yesterday and they went ahead and let me have it with nothing. Okay. Yeah, I can definitely figure out pretty fast. What would you guys pick up? We it's a 2025. It is a Bobcat E48 compact excavator. Okay. Do you need the serial number on that? Yeah, I need the serial number. B is in boy, six. E. C as in Charlie, one three six one three. Okay, and what's the current value of the financing you guys have on it? Eighty eight four. Okay. All right. Yeah, let me just inquire here real quickly and see which policy we can add this to. But it'll either be one or the other though for sure. Okay. Well, the lift I know that we started we put it last year on the existing policy we had and then they came back after four weeks or six weeks and said no they they weren't doing that and it's on separate. Yeah, I'll check. I'll definitely check it for sure. So okay, right. Okay. All right. I'll definitely check first before I just go and submit it. But I'll definitely check with auto owners first. Okay. See if we can put it on there with the skid steer. But if we can't, then we would have to put it on there with the with the tree lift unfortunately. Okay. Okay. All right. Just let me know. All right. Talk to you later. Bye. Thanks. Bye.
