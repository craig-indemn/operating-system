Thank you for holding. This is JC. How may I help you? Hey JC, this is Veronica calling you back. Text you Trinity's license and date of when she received her license. All right. Let me take a look at it. Okay. Twenty twenty three. Okay, so let me contact National General. I'll send them this driver's license and then I'll send you a text message as soon as I have a response from them. They have to update it in their system. Okay, and when you check with them too, can you see what they can do about her having? I don't even know how it is happened. Where y'all had her as not being the first year never having a license. Because y'all had her on there as a person that can drive it because she had a permit, but when she got her license and everything, everybody was notified. So. Yeah, that's a National General situation. We don't go in there to update anything other than you know that she has her driver's license. Um, but I'm not I'm not sure what happened on there and as far as updating it year by year, but I'll um like like I said I'll reach out to them and see what we can do. And yeah, follow. Can you please follow up and see if there's some type of reimbursement or they don't carry this over from there because I I. She's added. I communicate with you guys. I also fill out and I make my payments. So I know like you're saying it's National General, but y'all added her on my license when I let y'all know that I had a person in my house that had a permit. I've been communicating with you guys. Okay. Yes, um we've we've done everything. But again, I've seen it happen a couple times with National General where for some reason it's not updated. But I'm gonna get in touch with them and I have to see what they have to say. And we'll go from there. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you for calling. Bye.
