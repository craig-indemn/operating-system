Hello. Good afternoon. Is this Delphina? Oh yes, I'm in my car. Okay, this is Ashley with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Oh, I'm doing fine, man. How are you? I was just calling to go ahead to put that in. Today, hopefully my soul security will be in this afternoon. But I know this is for this month, you know. For home or auto. Oh, for the auto. Okay. You gotta have my Mustang. You already have everything right. The three four nine eight. I'm gonna see. Hold on. You shouldn't have it. They used to have. So three hundred and fifteen with ninety. I can't pay two. Uh, three sixteen. I cannot pay three hundred and fifteen dollars. I'm gonna have to pay the one fifty seven man. That's all I have right now. I barely have it. I'm waiting for my soul security to come in. So just the payment for this month. As long as you pay that by the thirteenth of December, your policy is still in good standing. Now. Okay. Yeah, if it does, if it's after that, your policy is canceled. I understand. I had already called until the move will be later this month, so I can pay it. I already told them that. Okay. One fifty seven and ninety five. All right, I got that in the process. Was there anything else? No, that's all. Thank you. Bye bye. Come on.
