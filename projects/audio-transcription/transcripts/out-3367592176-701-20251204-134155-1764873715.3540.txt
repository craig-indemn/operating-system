Hey Susie, it's Jeremy Palmer at Alliance. How are you? Hey Jeremy, I'm good. How are you doing? I am doing good. First things first, Jeff Edmonds told me to tell you hello. Ah, love Jeff. Tell Jeff I said hello. I will. He and I spent some time together yesterday. We went to a little function together and we were talking. He's talking about you with working with him. I believe at Chapel, if I remember correctly. And the president there. Ashley, is that right? The vice president, yes. Vice president worked there as well. Duncan, is that the right name? Yep. Okay. Yes. Yeah, I was like, "Wow, that is so crazy. How small this world turns out." It is Jeff. Is great. He he. I loved working with him. And he said, "You're right out there. I guess you live in the Dobson area as well." Yes, I live between Dobson and Mount Airy. Oh my gosh, that is that is so crazy. Do you know Bolington Chad? Bolington. Chad Bolington. Does he's got farming here close to Pilot? He normally sets up right by the McDonalds with the strawberries. And then the corn as well. I don't know if you ever come through Pilot yourself at all. I don't go through Pilot a lot because usually coming from King I will go Old 52 and then get on 52. Uh huh. So I don't directly come through. I actually used to work in Pilot, but the name sounds familiar, but I don't personally know who who they are. Gotcha, gotcha. Well, his wife has come came to me and they're wanting me to shop their farm. Okay. Um. And I wanted to see what our options were. If it's something, I feel like this would be a pretty strong relationship and client, especially coming from. They're wanting to maybe get away from Farm Bureau. Okay. Um. And like I said, he is local. Um, he's got some chicken houses. He does some. Um, you know crops, you know just crops, different things. Um, his home is nine years old. Things, those are those are the things. He's got three chicken houses there. And just wanting to know if it was something we could take a look at the house. The chicken houses are almost 30 years old. Now we don't do anything with poultry houses. Okay. When when we our farmers are basically just hobby farm based. We don't like we don't want anything that's like a big. I mean, if it's just a personal type hobby farm, that would be fine. But we wouldn't be able to do anything with the poultry houses. We would have to exclude all of those. So if we excluded the poultry houses, would you and you wouldn't do crop insurance either then? What did we do not do crop insurance either? Okay. So we are based basically as just like hobby personal use farms. We are not looking into the big like you see some of these that actually does the crop insurance like for hail. Those type things that do the poultry houses. We are not that type of farm. We don't offer those type of farm policies. So we are more like house, couple of barns, cows, those type things. All right. So if we did, we did house. We could do house and maybe like you said some storage buildings or. Um, you know some items there. Would am I hearing you right? Or how many acres does he have? He's sitting on 12 acres. Okay, so only 12 acres. He's got the poultry houses and the crops. He's got the crop section on other properties. Okay, that he rents from people to do the farming. So is he going to have a separate policy on the crops? We would be. I mean, we don't have crop insurance to actually cover the crop itself. But we could do how many acres is the crops on? Um. That's a good question. I know he's on numerous properties. That much I could tell you. It'd be a lot of different properties that he's doing that. Are we looking at going six seven hundred eight hundred acres? Are we talking a hundred acres
