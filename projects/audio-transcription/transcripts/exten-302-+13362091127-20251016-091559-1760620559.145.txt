Thank you for holding. This is Anna. How can I help you? Yes, Anna, my name is Jay Straight Gill. I'm with North Carolina Fire Protection. Yeah. And I was told yesterday that Amani is no longer there, and I was supposed to contact you. Okay. That sounds right. Yeah, that's correct. All right, and what what's happened? I just opened this. I just got this mail yesterday and opened it. And it said forty one dollars and seventy nine cents. So I called them and said, "How how is this so? I mean, why did I pay a thousand and something dollars? " And then I got forty one. And then I start reading it, and it's what they're doing. What they did as of the 12th, they they discontinued my insurance. So I asked them, "Could I not reinstate it?" They said, "No, I have to get what you got." Yes, give me one second. Let me pull this up. Okay. And I've got a policy number if you need that. No, you're good. I got the account pulled up. Okay. So I'm not sure what all happened when Amani was handling this account. I know your policies that were with auto owners they did get canceled for non payment and we were not able to reinstate them. So it looks like Amani was trying to rewrite your package to West Band or your um. And your auto, and what happened was the West Band wouldn't take the auto. So he wrote it with Progressive. It looks like he did make a month one month payment with Progressive, but then one month was missed. And when that month was missed, it did cancel for non payment. I understand. Now package. I don't know what happened with the package. I don't think he ever rewrote it with West Band. I don't think you you've had cover since. Well, I think it canceled back a month ago. Yes. Yeah. Well, they sent a toy. They told me to toy. Okay. So a few days ago. Um. So what I guess what happened? Most of my stuff was automatic. It was get paid automatically, and this got separated out. So West Band was what type of what insurance policy was that? So West, that was your package, which is your general liability, property, and anything like that. So I don't have that either. Correct. It looks like the only policy that you have active with us right now is your workers compensation. Well, I need I need help. Okay. I mean somehow somehow I know it fell through the cracks. I don't know what took place, but. And yeah, and I'm not sure either. Like I said, I just took it over from Amani. If I did send an email back to you about a week ago, did you ever receive a buying chance? I have it. Um. And there's no excuse, but I actually I had some trouble with my hand. Knuckle swell, and I didn't get on the computer for a while because my it was my hand was locked up. Just now start to be able to move it again. I don't know if I did it. It worked. Pulled on something. I mean, it's not it didn't bruise or anything. It just got real swollen and it couldn't move my fingers. Oh no. I've never had anything quite like it happen, but anyway, I stayed off the computer for at least a week. Okay. Gotcha. Okay, well I let me look into it. Let me see what I can do to get some policies running for you. Like I said, right now you do still have your workers comp, so that one is okay and good to go. Let me see what I can do about your package and auto and see if I can get them replaced. Okay. Well, and the the other the you talked about liability insurance that's very important to me. Correct. Yeah, that's part of your package. That's the one I'm going to have to see if I can relocate it with a different carrier. Got. Okay. Okay, give me some time. Let me see what I can do, and then I'll give you a call with an update. Okay. Okay, and what are you thinking? Just off hand. I'm not really sure. It just depends on how quickly the carriers are going to respond to me and approve a quote. I'm going to try my best to get something today, but I can't make any promises. Okay. It's like I said. It depends on how quickly they they will respond to me. I got. Okay, but I will I will work on it and try to make it urgent. I possibly can. I'll give you a call with an update. Okay. Okay, and this number you got my two o nine eleven twenty
