Hi, sorry about the whole. This is Gloria Galassi Insurance. How are you doing today? I'm doing well. Hope you are. Yes, sir. Sir, is this Gloria? Yes, this is Gloria. Okay, Gloria. My name is Shea Glass. I'm with I'm the president of the Greystone Condos. And I talked to you. It's been a while back. I think it was about 1219 so about our condo insurance. Anyway, I have a little problem. I have both my my my auto owner policy is with auto owners and my HO six policy is with the auto owners and then I'm the president of the condos. And a while back, I was talking to somebody and they suggested that I go online and sign up so that I could see the. Greystone condo policy under my username and password when I log on. So I could check on things. Anyway, which I did. Okay, Saturday I got an email telling me that auto owners had devoted 15. 47 cents out of a credit card of mine. And I don't know why they would have done that when I log on to auto owners. My my auto policy is set up for auto pay. My home my HO six is set up for auto pay, and when I look at the Greystone policy, it says it is not set up auto pay. Yes, they charged it to my credit card, and I actually the last time I talked to you I talked that same day talked to our treasurer and had her send a check to auto owners. Oh. And I don't know why they would have been. I don't know what gives them the authority to. But hey, I sent an email to them. I guess it was probably Saturday. And and I got this email back this morning from a lady named Pamela Davidson. And it says our records show that Gloria from your agency scheduled the 121925 payment in the amount of 15. 47. Yeah. Because I ask them, I ask them why they charged it to my credit card. Yes. And so let me explain. So on Saturday, I was actually watching on your account. Yes, I was just making sure everything looks as it supposed to, and I actually called auto owner today to ask about the new addition. The new condo you just added to your policy. So I was making sure everything is fine, and then I saw that billing is still pending cancellation. And I. I am not sure how I forgot that you said you're gonna send them a check, and then I was the only thing I remember was the fact that we did go through that the 15 dollars was. What it was about, and then I completely forgot that you were going to send the check. So what I can do is I can call the auto owner back right now and then have them refund the 15. Seventy five. Yeah, I'm surprised they could even charge it when the account was set up not to be paid that way. No, it's because because I I made the payment and I do apologize. Yes, so they did it. Yeah, because I was I was scared the account is going to go canceled. And yes, and I completely forgot the fact that you said you will email a check. Let me take something. I think I went back and looked after I talked to you to see why I thought we had a 15. 47 charge. Yeah, and I think what happened is, sort of at the last minute we increased our deductible from 5, 000 to 10, 000. Uh huh. I'm trying to remember the man's name. There's a man that works for once to Salem. He sent me a because I told him I said I need a bill so I can pay it, and he sent me what he said was a preliminary bill. And it even said in the email that it was a preliminary bill, so it was probably just off by the 15. Dollars and 47 cents. Yeah, the amount of money is not that big a deal. Yeah, but I think that is the authorization. Yes, authorization is required. Oh, so that's I take on that. That's on my my part. I completely didn't remember the fact that you said you were gonna email you're gonna issue my check. And then I was I just thought, oh, I did converse with him about the 15 dollars and he was aware of of it and I just. I just I don't know how I forgot and then I just. Yes, so I think this is not a big. This is Gloria. This is not a big deal. Yes, sir. And I'm sure you know. Evidently, they haven't got the check yet. I did on Saturday. I texted our treasurer and I said, "Did you
