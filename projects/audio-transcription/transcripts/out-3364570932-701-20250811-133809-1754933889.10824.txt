Hello. Hello, Miss Beard. This is Jeremy of Lions Insurance. Yes, hey Jeremy. Jeremy, how you doing? I'm doing well, thank you. Hope you are. I'm okay. I was looking forward to your phone call back on Friday afternoon, but then when Lions left me a message, I thought it was you. And they said, "Well, we saw you missed your call. We see that you're trying to call us, and I was like, 'That's not the type of message I was waiting on.' Oh, let's see. I think um. I don't know who that last call was. I think you talked to Cecilia one day. If I remember correctly, had talked about. Yeah, but you and I. You and I spoke on the H. You and I spoke on the H I need to go and make a note. Not on your notepad, Jeremy. No, I'm typing it. I'm typing it right now. I'm just messing with you. You are. All right, so this time I've typed it in the right location here. This time we'll just type it on that. Okay. All right. Copy that. Now send that message out to another contact that I work with here. Okay. Between the two of them, whoever answers first, that's all I'm running with that way. Okay. Well, okay. And I just like you said though, talk about trying to get notes put in the right place. Okay. I'm glad he wasn't on vacation this week. No, I I don't I really gave vacation. All right. Yeah, he wasn't no help. All right, so here's the next option here. Okay. To issue. To issue. All right. I want to see if she can uh. Try. She says she feels like that's the case, but it's been a while. Uh. And I think she's going to look and see if she can go in there and do it. I don't have direct access into this particular company. Um, it's like, probably one of two companies that I haven't gotten access into yet. Oh. I mean, I'm able to see the proposals and different things that they send out to explain them to you in that. But it's one of those things that's been on the, the to do list that's falling down the priority list with other things that they can present it. And that has nothing to do with Mondays or Fridays. So let me ask you a question while we wait and. Is it a similar same insurance like I had before? Yeah, it's actually got some bells and whistles that your other did not. Let me finish typing this. So to answer your question, one of the things I know is that it's got equipment, equipment breakdown coverage. Which covers like the larger things with your home if it's not due to negligence on your part. You know, if you don't pour water into the circuitry for your HVAC system or something like that, but. What about a water heater? Even though my state. Yeah, it should be. It's got a deductible of 500 for occurrence on that. Um, it would never hurt to just try and check it out. That comes included at that price. That's okay. I was just asking, but I just bought a new water um. Yeah, when I read. How much did you do for now? Uh, I paid. I paid seven eight hundred. The one I got. Because it all goes by, you know how many people you have in a home, the uses of you know what's being used. So it all you know based on that. So they have more. If you have more people in your house, then you need more. What you call it? Like I went by. Yes. Yes. So I went by the number of like three to four people in the home, but you know they have one that's you know larger than that. If I remember correctly, because I got everything filed, but I would say I paid about 700 or. What's that? Man, I know everything. It doesn't matter what you really look at. Um. But in this day and age, doesn't sound highly reasonable for something that tends to traditionally. Hold up for a reasonable amount of time, you know. Right. Everything's going up. I know the home insurance. The difference is like 30 more, which that's okay. But my taxes, I had to call. For site county and we spent some questions because my taxes went up more than double compared to what I paid last year. I mean, it went 584 dollars different. Actually, it's a long thing. Holy smoke, that is a lot. Exactly. Definitely a lot. Oh Lord, she said she was trying to get logged in. And then it asked for she's having technical issues with their site right now. I'm going to see what I'm going to do. Here's what I'm going to do, Juliet. I'm going to call Nancy Grange directly myself. And I'm going to and I really will. I'll joke inside. You're the only thing I've got in front of me right now that I will touch. Um, let me call them and see what I can find out for, and then I will give you a call back in lady. Okay, so if I don't hear from you by let's say four o'clock, should I call you? Yes, ma'am. If you don't, good Lord. I'm trying not to jinx myself right now. I don't want like I said, but yeah, send yourself an email and just flag it as a reminder and then you'll know to call me. Sometimes we just have to do that. Oh yeah, absolutely. That's exactly right. So I'm going to put a reminder here on the sticky and stick it right there onto the side of my monitor where it's. There you go, bright orange. It's in my face now. Okay. Okay. How are you in the office too today? Oh, I'm here until five. Okay, I got up to four thirty. Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. All right. Thank you. Yes. Okay. Bye bye. Bye bye.
