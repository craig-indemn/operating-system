Hello, this Jeff. Hey Jeff, it's John John. Hey John, how are you man? Like everybody else, trying to survive. Yeah. I understood understood. Hey, let me jump right to it. All right, first of all, on the renewal for the barn, I did see that earlier this week. I've got the diary in my schedule for Joe and I to review that, among other things, on Tuesday of next week. So if you don't mind, give us till then to take a look at it. I did I did see where it went up six hundred bucks. I looked into it. There's a slight increase in the barn building coverage. It went up from like one point five million, maybe sixty thousand bucks. I'm thinking. So that was minimal. It's part of the the contract to increase. I think four percent. So other than that, I'm not sure what would have generated it, but we will look at it next week and we'll get back to you on that. Okay. Yeah, that's perfect. Now on TRS, I'm a little bit confused by what USLI is asking. I thought when we sent them the appraisal that would you know it is a little bit low insurance to value for the square footage, but we had an appraisal that we sent in with it that was done back in March. I felt like they would, and we're asking we're only asking for actual cash value coverage, which is basically what the appraisal stating. So I felt like they would be okay with it. They're not at the same time they're not really giving me hey we'd like to see it at seventy five dollars square foot or something like that. They're not really helping me much. Other than asking the questions, so that's kind of where I'm coming from with what I've sent you is basically what they've sent me. And then once I get these answers from you, I may try to call this lady and just say hey you know what would you like to see it at if you're not satisfied with what we're trying to put on it and just kind of go back and forth with them because they really are our best option. With the situation as it is now, it's a you know more than half vacant building with some renovations with some occupancy. They're about the only show we have that would write that type of exposure. So trying to work with them in a way that's satisfactory to both sides. So okay, so that's where we are. Gotcha. So to get so to go back on the questions, she asked and I guess this was going back to when you first bought the building. They quoted some property coverage at that time and part of that was renovations, and so she's kind of pulling from that quote to ask this question. When we wrote the GL policy, the renovations were shown to be two hundred thousand dollars per the appraisal. They're now shown to be two hundred twenty thousand as the insured started renovations, and so that's where that question's coming from. So what's the best answer that I can give her? So my question to you would be, what do you guys consider renovation? Right. Good question. Typically, it's a it's a structural change like if you're updating things like HVAC or electric electrical stuff that's more maintenance I think than renovation. Renovation would be adding a wall, adding some space. Okay. So to if we're going off of that definition, there's been no renovations done. Okay. So what has been done that we can say nope they've not done renovations but here's what they've done. Yeah, basically other than cleaning and painting and putting in working light bulbs and stuff like that. I mean there's been no wiring moves, no walls have been knocked down, anything like that. So the and I don't know how much of it important or not, but the original when I was supposed to get that loan for the two hundred. Yep. I made the mistake when I bought the building that I didn't do a title search and it didn't have a clean title. Sure. Okay. So the bank of course wouldn't loan it for me until the it had a clean title from the previous owner. It has nothing to do with Jessica I. Gotcha. And so we just this building just sat there and sat there, and the major part of that is that my phone or yours. I think it's mine. I'm trying. I believe I've got a short in my handset. I'm hearing it too, but. Okay. Yeah. But that that loan was really supposed to go. I think about half of it was supposed to fix the half of the roof that leaks because only half of it leaks. Okay. The half that doesn't leak is kind of where we've started painting, cleaning just. I put down some flooring. I mean I didn't write concrete, so I put down flooring. Yep.
