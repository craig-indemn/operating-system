Hey Marcia, this is Brandy with the Lions Insurance. I was just giving you a call, letting you know that your liability on your homeowners policy will extend to your camper at Baden Lake. If you have any other questions, please let us know. I am going to send you a declarations page, just to show proof of that to the campground owner. That way you can show proof to him that you do have liability coverage. If there is any other questions, please let us know at three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thanks and have a great day.
