Hey, Mister Kidley, it's Gary. You got Lions Insurance. How are you, sir? I know you got some other things going on there. I saw some notes on your file here, but I was calling to talk to you about these rates for the home auto and umbrella. Okay, can you hold on for like one minute? So I can get in the office here. Oh yeah, yeah. Just give me one minute. One minute, I'll come and move to the office. Okay, sorry. That's okay. Okay, I have run I have run this thing. Okay, no, I got you. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I have ran the quotes several different ways. I've ran it splitting it up and with one company so you could get all the discounts on everything. Um, now on your homeowners, does your escrow pay your homeowners? Or do you pay that yourself? No, the escrow. It is or is not. No, it's paid through the escrow. Yes. Okay, the escrow premium on the homeowners is 2165. And they they increase the coverage on the house up to 425, 000. Um. The auto, which was the best rate with the four cards and the three drivers, is 2686. Ah, before thank you. Give me one second here and write this down. Sure. The homeowners was 2165. And they raise the they increase the coverage almost almost 100, 000. And that's based on the replacement valuation. Increased coverage about 100, 000. Yeah. Okay, I'm sorry. That's okay. That's okay. I can email these quotes to you if you want me to. What do you say about the auto as a four cars? The the four cars with the full coverage on there is 268664 and these are all 12 month rates. Gotcha. And then I was going to say that you know if if your mortgage is paying it then you can't get the full pay discount. On there because they don't allow that, but on the auto if you pay that yourself and you don't take a monthly rate. Then that 2686. If you pay it in full, it's 30 or 2365. So you can save a little over 300 if you pay all of that at one time. Now you won't you won't be able to do it on the home because of an escrow billing. 2365. Yeah, and then the umbrella coverage is 294. For a million dollar umbrella. How much? 294 a year. Umbrella. Yes. And I I looked at several different companies and this is the best combined rate that we have. Even when I split the policies up, you know and divided up with with two or three separate companies. It's still a lower rate by combining it together with this company which is auto owners insurance. Auto owners insurance. Yes, sir. So just keep it all with them. These are rates if we if we have everything with them. Yeah, you would have it all with them, just like you had the others with Main Street. But the the coverage amounts on the Main Street policy didn't look like they had been updated for a few years. And so that's why they increased the the coverage on the house. Gotcha. How much did that go up? Um, let's see. It went from almost 1400 to the 2165. Gotcha. Okay. Now that's with a thousand dollar deductible. And if you would be willing to go up higher on the deductible, you could get a lower rate. But you're at you're at a thousand dollar deductible now, and if you go to say 2500. Then you could get a lower rate by increasing the deductible. Okay. Let me. Let me run this by my by my wife. Um. The options in terms of how to pay it. And can I call you back pretty pretty soon? You can call me back. You can call me back. You know any time that you want, as long as we can you know try to get it something finalized on that before the first of the month because it does renew first. Okay. Yeah, I'll um we talk to her and discuss her and I'll give you a call back. But then this next that'll be fine. When you call back in, ask for me. My name's Gary G A R Y. Gotcha. And I'll have all I'll have the access to all the documents. And the um the homeowners went up because the increase of coverage went up 100, 000 dollars. And if the escrow, we can't really lower that if what
