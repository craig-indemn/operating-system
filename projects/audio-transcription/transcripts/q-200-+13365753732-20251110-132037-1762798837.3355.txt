Thank you for holding this, hello. Hello. Yeah. Hi, how can I help you? Yeah, I was um wanting to get a quote uh for my auto insurance. Okay, for your auto insurance. That's right. Okay, do you do on your home or have renters insurance or any other policy besides your vehicle? Oh, with Alliance. No, um. So do we have your insurance? Any of your insurance policies? I don't I don't have any insurance on Alliance. Um, for the auto insurance, I still have an insurance going on. Just wanting to have an opinion. On another insurance, that's why I'm calling and regarding the renters insurance. I have a renters insurance from State Farm. So you okay? So you have um, you have a vehicle auto and renters insurance with State Farm. Um, auto insurance. I have some different ones, not the State Farm. Okay, so could we quote your your auto and renters? Is that okay? Um, actually, I would like to do just an auto insurance. So that so we don't write just a single auto policy. Uh huh. So you don't do just auto insurance. Correct. Yes, just a just a single line auto policy. The man. We don't. Okay, actually, I'm about to move from this um apartment. So like for a month, I really don't want to change my, renter's insurance. I would prefer after like two months when I step out from this apartment, but just for one month, I would not just change the. Renters insurance. Yeah, so we don't have any carriers that we could quote without the renters. Okay. Actually, one of my friend recommended to get an auto insurance from your insurance. That's all right. Oh well, I'll call if if I still need anything changes. Yeah, if anything changes for sure, give us the call back. Um, we could definitely quote the auto and the renters insurance. All right. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Bye bye. Bye.
