Hello. Hey, Lynetta, this is just Jeremy. I'm calling from Alliance Insurance. How are you doing? Oh, I'm on my way to a doctor's appointment. Oh, I've got impeccable timing, do I not? Absolutely. What time did Ronok call you back? Um. Is it something that's going to take more than five minutes to explain to me? I was just going to give you prices. That's really what I was going to go into. Yeah, go ahead. Throw something out there so I can tell my husband. All right. It would be the the home. These are paid in full discounts. I'm going to give you these numbers. It'd be right at 940 dollars for the home. And the auto would be 100774. Oh, okay, yeah. Um. Do you have my email address? Can you email me the information? I got to look for the eggs at 181. 109 Bob eggs at 109. Big Country W at Gmail. Yes, if you could email me that information. Yeah, we're kind of. He had an appointment in Ronok and I have an appointment in Christiansburg. We're running tight. But thank you, Jeremy. I appreciate it. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. All right, and can you send me like what it would be on payments per month or whatever? It shows all that. It's all broken out in that proposal. It's a lot more cut and dry for you. Okay. All right, thanks. I appreciate it. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. All right, bye bye. Bye bye.
