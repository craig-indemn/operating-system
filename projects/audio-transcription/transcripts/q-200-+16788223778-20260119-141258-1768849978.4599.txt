State Farm. Okay. Both the Mark. Okay. All right, good deal. So I just need to get a little bit of information from you if I may.

Well, my rental homeowners insurance and auto are together. Okay. State Farm. All right, very good, very good. All right, so let me. I am paying like two hundred and sixty dollars a month. Wow, that is pretty. There, do you have any claims or any points? I am clear, but I think our insurance went up because I don't know if it's a claim. I know my wife was in a little little bit of a wreck. We didn't total the car, but we did take a payout for repairs. Okay. All right. That's about it. There is no speeding tickets or anything. Okay. Understood. Understood there. All right, so who am I speaking with? Your first name? Matthew Adela. I know my brother got car insurance for you guys. Okay. Good deal.

Of course, and you would select that you have State Farm as your current carrier, and then log in like you normally would. It'll send me a copy of your VIN numbers and coverage amounts over to me, showing what types of coverages you have on each vehicle. The big the big part about this is getting the VIN numbers correct.

And then I'll start bundle pricing, and what you can expect from me is probably a call from me tomorrow around this time, if things go according to plan and without a hitch.
