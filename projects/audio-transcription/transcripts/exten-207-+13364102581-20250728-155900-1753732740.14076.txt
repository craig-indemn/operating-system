Sorry if you are holding. This is Cody. Can I help you? Yeah, Cody. This is Jean. How you doing, buddy? Hey, Jean. I am good. How are you, sir? Doing good. Do me a favor on that. All that insurance for the boats and stuff. Yes, please. We don't need. We don't need no kind of towing on it. Okay. Because we have. Toto. Toto. Okay. And I need very minimal coverage. You just want liability only in no. No, I want collision and comp. Okay. I don't know what. On everything, if I have. Okay. With your jet ski in mind, yeah, yeah, but no. There is collision and comp. You want collision and comp by assumption. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um. Let me give me one second here. I am just going in here. Because I noticed that policy was pretty cheap. Yeah, well, yeah, especially on those brand new jet skis, they're not cheap to insure for sure. Yeah, I mean that one got supercharged. Yeah, yeah, they're fast and unfortunately a lot of things happen on jet skis. So you want to get rid of the medical payments coverage as well. No, no, just get rid of the towing. That's basically about it. Extra. Any sort of fishing equipment obviously. Okay. So no slot signing glide. That's your towing. Cody. This. Hey. Yes, ma'am. We need to take the towing off of all of them. Correct. And as far as taking, what is the other stuffy? It's. What is he thinking? He can take off. Um. Well, you definitely want to have comp and collision on them. Right. But yeah, I mean, I didn't put the you know like the hurricane haul out coverage like I didn't put that on there. No, I don't need that. Replacement cost, personal effects. We can take that off. I guess there is nothing there. No signing glide, no coverage there. Because I don't want to take off stuff and like because these are down at the coast. Right. And I don't want to take stuff off and then be like. You know. Right. I want to be insured like if it hits somebody or somebody. Your comp and collision is the main things you know all these other things are you know additional coverages that progressive and other companies have added to boat policies. Just provide other coverages for different situations like towing and replacement costs and different things like that. Just going through each one of these just to make sure everything's off of here. But the medical payments cover you. You want to have some some med pay coverage because sometimes that can avoid you having a liability claim because sometimes med. Yeah, I don't want to get myself in a world of crap. You know what I mean. Absolutely not. And everybody is too happy anymore. So I want to make sure that we're completely covered. Exactly. You do have disappearing deductibles on here, which I would keep because your deductibles are super cheap. No. So I would keep that on there. I've removed the signing glide from that one. Nothing else on that one. I moved all those. Okay. All right. I've removed the signing glide and any additional coverages that aren't needed from all of the. All of them. Make sure that's gone. Okay. We just got a lot going on. My car broke down in Winston and I am sitting here at sheets and now we just had a wreck show. Yes, it's. And our air conditioner went out, so it's just been a total crap show for us. I've had some AC issues at my house and yeah, I get it. Let's see. Okay, I think I've gotten everything taken off of there that isn't the. You know your main liability coverage, medical payments, comp and collision on all of them. All of your your essential type coverages are on there and all the you know the extra type coverages are off now. Okay. Let me. I want to be I want to be good and insured. Right, I just. You know what I am saying. Of course, yeah. So that decreased everything. Like I said, these coverages are a little additional coverages. They don't you know they don't add a whole lot of premium to the policy, but that reduced it one hundred and. Forty three dollars. That's good. So it went down a little bit just from taking those extras off. Okay, well I get a new thing that will tell me what the price is on each one of those jet skis. What the new bill would be. After we process this, you should receive something in the mail with all of the updated information. Okay. If not, I am sure that I could get you. If you
