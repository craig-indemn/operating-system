Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hello. How are you doing? I'm good. And you? Good. My name is Melissa Somy. You guys cover my auto owners covers my auto insurance, and we were involved in an accident last week coming home from vacation. So I submitted everything last night through the claims portal. I think, but the only policy it made note of was my flood policy. So I just wanted to make sure that you guys had actually received all the information. And then if I could talk with someone like about what the process looks like in next steps. Yes, I can get you over to an agent. Just one moment. Sure.
