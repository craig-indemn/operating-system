Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hi, I have a general question for you. Okay. Um, what do I need to send via email to cancel my coverage with Alliance? Is it a declaration page? Uh, for the new business. I mean, for the new. When you went with. Yeah. Yeah, you can send that to us. Okay, and then do I need to do anything else? No, they'll probably have to get you to sign something, so you'll probably still have to speak to someone. Where? At the new insurance. Are you talking about canceling the policy here? Yeah. Yeah, you'll have to speak to someone here that way that you can because you'll have to sign something to cancel it. Okay, so my first step would be what to talk to someone or send a declaration page. Well, um, you might would want to speak. I mean, you can send it. I can give you the email to send it if you want to go ahead and do that, but you'll still need to speak to someone. Okay. Can I do that? Speak to someone, please. Yeah, sure. Can give me one moment. Thank you. You're welcome.
