Hello. Hey, this is Corbin with Alliance Insurance. Is Tiffany. Yes, it is. Hey Corbin, how are you? What's going on? No, listen, I was calling. I got your contact information from my cousin Jermaine Lane. Yeah. And yeah, we are trying to find and we may not be able to a cheaper insurance. We've been with National General for quite some time. And we had a jump. Our policy is getting ready to be renewed, and we had a jump from five hundred. To six thirty-seven, and you may tell me the same thing, but what they told me is that because my mother, who is listed on the policy, is showing up. As having, she's a driver on the policy, but she has an expired driver's license. But she has an expired driver's license because she hasn't driven in over ten years, so she just didn't renew. But they said because she hasn't physically turned her license in, then they have to list her. So I don't know that's going to continue to be a problem, but. I would turn in and get her an ID. Okay. You'll be fine. Yeah, just do that, and then you said six hundred and some for a year or six months or. Yeah, six hundred and thirty-seven dollars a month for six months, and then we renew. Yeah. Yeah. Six hundred a month. You are saying. Yeah, we went from five hundred a month, and then our renewal is going to be. So we've been paying the five hundred, but then when it jumped up from five hundred to six thirty-seven. For over thirty years, we've had National General. So I don't know. Who's your agent? Who is it? Used to be a lady named Donna. Donna is no longer there. So oh, it's affordable insurance. It's affordable. Can I take it over and manage it for you? Well, yeah, that's the whole goal is to see if we can. Yeah, if I manage it for you. Yeah, we would do. I hate to talk you off, but we would do on the six. And I didn't pay it because and we have a notice of cancellation scheduled to cancel on the twentieth. So I was trying to see if I can find something less. If I couldn't, then I am just because we won't be without insurance. So. Yeah. I just have to buckle down and pay. Well, let me. You are talking about you have to reinstate it. Is what you are saying. Right, right, but it hasn't canceled. Yeah, I think they give you. What's your? You said the renewal date was on the six. Yeah, I was supposed to renew. I had it on auto pay, and then when I got the um. I canceled the auto pay because I said that this is ridiculous. Yeah. And then because when I got the renewal because we renew on the second of November, so I canceled the auto pay. Say that I am just going to try to see they sent the notice of cancellation on December. I mean on October twentieth. And I said I was going to either try to find some cheaper insurance or stay with them. So you said, "Yeah, let me let me just go in there and what um. " So your name's first, Tiffany. No, it actually it's my mom's name is first, and she's the one who doesn't have the license. So the car is in her name. Well, see that's another thing. So there is a car we have a Nissan Altima that was in my mother's name, which is paid for. The Altima is a twenty fifteen, so that's paid for. Then we have a Volvo XC sixty, which is in my mom's name and my name. And then there is a Chrysler, which is in my brother's name and my name. So it's me, my mom, my dad, and my brother on the policy. Okay, gotcha. Well, we all live in the same house. Okay, yeah. Let me let me run through. What tell me your mom's name. Name is Linda L I N D A. Her last name is Graham G R A H A M. Did okay to use this phone number for her. Yeah, it is like I say. I am not with her right now, but we live together.
