Thank you for holding this. Is Brandy? How can I help you? Hi Brandy, my name is Robin Nelson. I need to make some changes to my auto insurance. Okay, Robin, can you verify your mailing address for me, please? Two eighty Bethesda Drive, Lexington two seven two nine five. Okay, and while I'm getting your policies pulled up, what changes are we going to be making? I'm going to be taking two vehicles off and adding one. Okay, and have you already turned in the tags for those vehicles? Yes. All right, and when did you turn in the tag? It was Friday. Okay, and which two vehicles are we removing? The Chevrolet truck and the Honda Odyssey. Okay, and when did you purchase the new vehicle? Saturday. Okay, and do you have the VIN number to the new vehicle? I do. I that's why I that's why I probably sound like I'm a little. I cannot find the folder that I had the bill of sale and everything in. Okay. Do you have access to that vehicle right now? I do. Okay, because you can look on the windshield. Sometimes it's on the windshield, on the driver side, on the very bottom. Sometimes they have it right there, or it's inside the door. On the driver door. Okay. What in the world? Okay. I'm guessing this is the VIN number's a really long number with a barcode. With a yeah, it'll have letters and numbers. Yeah. Yep. It's one G six. D M five. Seven T five. Seven zero one. Four eight six three one. Okay, it's a 2007 Cadillac. Yes. Okay, and are you financing this one at all? No. Okay. And are you wanting comprehensive inclusion on it or just liability only? Just liability. Okay, so we are removing the 2002. Chevrolet Silverado and the 07 Honda Odyssey as of Friday the seventh, and then we're adding on a 2007 Cadillac. Effective 11:8, which was Saturday for liability only. Is there anything else I can help you with? No, that's it. Okay, this will take about 24 hours to update into the system for everything the process. You will receive an email once it has been completed. Okay. Okay, so I won't be able to get my tags until I get that notification. Right. Yeah, so we'll have to send you proof of insurance. Okay, but well, I mean, you already have an active policy, so all we need is your policy number. So you could actually give them an ID card from another vehicle. Because all they need is a policy number. Can you by any chance email me that? Or something with that on there to policy number. Yeah, no problem. I can do that. All right. All right. Is there anything else I can help you with, Robin? That's it. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a wonderful day. You too. Bye bye. Thanks, bye.
