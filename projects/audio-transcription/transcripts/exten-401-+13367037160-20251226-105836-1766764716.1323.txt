I am holding us together. Good morning, Heather. Good morning, Julia here. Hey, Julia. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I did send you the email. I wonder if you received it. And we decided we're gonna cancel it. Cancel that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We decided we're gonna. We we moved the the the home to the old state already. I sent you you know I think yesterday or something like that. And then we're gonna cancel the. We're gonna cancel the autos too because. It's this home insurance is too much. So they give us a pretty good and then we just gonna move it all at once. So that we are. An old state. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And you process that? Yeah. And then yeah, my husband did did everything and then he said we're gonna kick in today. The insurance. Is it the same coverage or better? Yeah. Yeah. It is. Okay. Also have a roadside. Yeah. Okay. It is better. We go back and forth. We go back and forth. Yeah. Yeah. We like to back again. That's right. Just reach out to me anytime you need me to look at that for you. Okay. Of course. Of course. I love your service too. Absolutely. Oh, you are. Well, we love hearing. Oh. Yeah. You're so very very comfortable. Yeah, but anyway. So my husband and the older thing and we we sit down and we're talking all day. Seems like that's better. As long as it's better coverage or the same, you know a lot of people will change for a better premium unless you know the saving money. But a lot of times that will happen in their coverage because. Car insurance is pretty much pretty much the same, but just a few a little a little bit feel better. Price wise, but the home insurance is that's a big big big mom a big huge mom. Yeah. So. Okay. Well, thank you, Helen. So you got you process that. Yes, ma'am. I sure will. Yeah. Well, the home had already canceled. I know. So that just flat canceled now the auto. When did you say that needs to cancel? Yeah. What date? What what date is all? This is being recorded that today. Twenty-six today, right? Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah, the auto gonna kick in today. Cancel the the auto today then. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, would Julia? So then I think they have some rate going to return refund back. You're gonna according to the yearly. All the all the insurance have that. So so how how they process the the the refund? I think they have their system calculation. Just. What's the what is the? I think the. Let's see the fire the credit card fire. Probably using the same credit card refund. I think the one American Express. Yes, they should credit that back. Let me see. Yeah. It is American Express. I gave it to you last time. I think American Express right. Just double check. Yeah. Okay, Helen. Okay, Heather. Yeah, it is not gonna show me Julia the payment that we took that on. It just shows that it was paid in full. But you will get a refund. It'll be pro rated. Yes. It'll either be applied back to that card or they'll mail you a check. But usually it it's applied back to however you paid. Okay. Thank you so much, Heather. Okay, Julia. You have a happy new year. You too, hun. Let me know if I can help you guys. Sure. All right. I will. I will. Take care. Bye bye. Take care, Helen.
