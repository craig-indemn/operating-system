How are you? I'm good. How are you doing, Jamie? I'm going okay. I need a cup of coffee. I'm struggling this afternoon. But I have two. Yeah, it's been a long day. Have two hopefully easy and quick questions for you. We've got a mutual client here, homeowners policies of AO. They are unfortunately moving to Missouri. And the client told me it's probably going to take a couple trips just to move all the stuff up there and get settled. And so I think I told her right, but I just want to make sure. Personal property. Look at a rental U-Haul and drive a U-Haul to Missouri to move. And then once they get there, they're going to put probably the majority of their personal stuff in a like a little mini storage facility until they buy an RV and then they're going to live an RV and do whatever they're going to do. So my two questions for you: personal property in transit in the back of a U-Haul. Could coverage come back to the homeowners policy in the event that U-Haul truck crashes and it's all gone? Yes. Okay, all right, good. That's I'm glad I remember the right answer. Second question is I don't know about the property in storage. I feel like the homeowners form would extend there, but I don't think it's going to give the whole value of it. Do you know what that would do? Like. Believe it's um 10 percent of coverage C, but I believe there's somewhere in there that um is. And like an exclusion unless they're moving, then I think it gets covered. Exclusion. Okay. Like to override. So like, would there be? So what? Okay, so so let's say they make this move in two trips, which I based on what Anne just told me. I think they're going to make it in a couple of trips. Let's say. They take a truckload of stuff to Missouri tomorrow and put it and put it in stores there. And then they come back to North Carolina and they've got load number two going out. In the event that during, let's say they draw stuff off the storage facility and they're on the way back to North Carolina, storage facility burns up. They are technically moving there. Okay. I think that I'm. Would that exclusion? Pull coverage away. So it. But it says that our limit for liability for personal property owned or used by an insured and located in a self storage facility is 10 percent of the limit of liability for coverage C or 1, 000, whichever is greater. But then it says the limitation does not apply to personal property. So it but the only reasoning is if it's moved from resident premise because the resident premise is being repaired, renovated, or rebuilt. So it doesn't actually say anything about the insured moving to a different resident premise. Um, so I think in this case it would keep the 10 percent of coverage C would be the highest limit. Okay, so I think what I'm going to advise her is just to know that there's 10 percent here on this homeowners form. But then probably when they get there, seek out some type of insurance there that would cover that. I think they will cover that some type of. Yeah. Personal property, whatever that the storage facility could sell them again. I don't know. I don't know what they would do there. Is it is that a thing? Like storage facilities sell insurance for. I believe. So yeah, I mean I'm sure. I mean it's probably different on each storage facility, but I'm sure they have some type of insurance that you can buy for it. I've never written one. I can think of that. Yeah. Okay. No, no, no, nothing I've ever seen before. Okay, well, uh, what that helps. I appreciate it and hope you have a good afternoon. Thank you, Ellie. Thank you. I hope you do as well. You're welcome. Bye. Yep. Bye.
