Thank you for holding. This is Cecilia. Hey Cecilia, this is Patty calling from Lightspeed Voice. Hey Patty, yeah, finally get to talk to you. Did you get my last email? I did. Yeah. I had a couple of questions because I'm trying to figure out the simplest way to set this all up. Yeah. Oh sorry, I just lost your email. Let me pull that back up. Um. Okay, for the 500 extensions, we've actually got 501 through 512. Yeah. What did I put on there? You mentioned that the 501 through. Those are the remote workers. Yes. Okay. Do those need to be billed separately? No, so that's do for accounting purposes. I think if we have them be a part of the main location, which is location one, we will be okay. But as far as like having physical phones and physical extensions, which is that 700 group, I would like to, if possible, change one of those locations. The orange or the other one to say Pilot Mountain. Okay. So I can move. Do you want me to move? You want me to move 501 to to 504 to location one. Just the billing, just the billing. Nothing will change as far as I'm only talking about the billing part. Yeah. So all of the the 500, 501 to 512 will need to be part of location one for billing. So all of them include so the ones that are now on location five for Philadelphia should be moved to one. Right. So there's no Philadelphia location. Okay. So I'm gonna do. 501 to 512. Move changing location. Okay. And then the 700s. If you can update location five to say instead of Philadelphia, it be Pilot Mountain. And then move the 700s there. That would be helpful. Okay. So update location five to. 700s. What is the what we did? We have a service agreement amendment that I can do for that, so that'll make it a really simple process. What is the address for Pilot Mountain? Let me get it. Thanks. We just had a ton of rain come through here, and my room is so dark now. Now where are you? And then Central Florida. Central Florida. Yeah, I mean it's it's all gloomy over here because of the hurricane, but. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Is everything okay though? Ah, well, you know I haven't watched the news, so I hope so. For the most part, it was really out out in the ocean, but you know we we're getting that the winds and. Yeah and all of that. But I think for the most part, yeah, it's okay. Not going to be too too bad. Pilot Mountain Office is 117 West Main Street, Pilot Mountain, North Carolina. What's the zip? 27041. Okay, so what I'll do is it's called a service agreement amendment. It's just a one page document. So basically, I'll say Philadelphia is no longer and now here's the new address. That just updates so it keeps the same service agreement, same rates, everything like that. And then I'll move all the 700s there. Yeah. For billing. Okay. Yeah. So then we'll have so then the 100s and the 500s will be on the main. Mount area will be the 200s, Walnut Cove is the 3s. Yeah. Four, I think. I think what I'm just going to do is a service agreement cancellation for location four. That that's still in term, but it's only one location. So you guys are such big customers. I'm just going to go ahead and cancel that service agreement if that's okay with you. Yes, because that extension again is no longer like being used and. I mentioned in my email. I just want to make sure that we could access any voicemails that it has. Oh yeah, so any of the those the call recordings are saved for the whole server, so they're not based just on the location. Okay. So they're all it's yeah they're all that wouldn't just eliminating that extension won't eliminate any of those call recordings. Okay. Um. So did you mean voicemails really or call recordings? Well, yeah, call recording. Okay. And I'm assuming well voicemail wouldn't be a recording would it? No, and that's a question that I I wouldn't I would refer you to our support team. If there are voicemails on that extension. Okay. To to figure out how to how to save those or move them. Yeah, it's fine
