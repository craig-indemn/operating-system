Hello, hello. This Jeff Edmonds going to help you. Hi Jeff, this is Amy Smith. How are you? Hey Amy, I'm doing fine. Hope you are. Oh yeah, I'm glad it's Friday though. Me too. Oh my god. Me too. Yeah, so I just want to touch base. We kind of left it with Joe. I'm trying to get that general liability for. You know our it says concrete services but you know more like. You know the building general contractor insurance and then the workers comp. Right. So what I did, I went ahead and updated your exposures with auto owners on the existing policy that you guys have under KTS concrete. Okay. Okay. Added all the things that you do. Okay. Put it in the form of an endorsement to kind of get a response from them to see how they would reply. Okay, so that we're kind of been wait and see on that. I haven't heard anything back for the rest of the week. Okay. Now on the workers the workers comp part. If I understood Joe correctly, it's just you and I forget your husband's name. It starts with an I. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean in the paperwork it's David so it's really. Gotcha. He goes by his middle name but yeah. Well, perfectly fine. And I'm not looking at screens. The only reason I couldn't recall it, but I think what Joe told me on that was that no one really wanted to be covered. That you and Ian both wanted to be excluded. Am I correct on that? Well, I was more or less like because we don't have employees. My my. Wanting for it is, you know we hire a sub and I know like you know Joe's been really good about educating me and making sure now that I really am good about getting their insurance you know before. Yeah. But but you know even if they told me that workers comp let's say they cancel it the next day or it's not enough coverage I just want to make sure that. Because there's going to be you know so many different random subs on the job when we're doing these things and you know it's definitely an accident prone environment that. Yep. We're covered like I don't want to over insure and but I just want to make sure that kind of stuff we're covered on. Well here's workers comp's a little bit unique in how it's set up and I don't want to. Give you too much info but if if you and Ian are the only two officers of of this corporation which I think you are. Yeah. Am I right there? Okay. Yeah. Let's assume that to be the case. And you too as the only officers elect to be excluded for any coverage. Okay, which you have the prerogative to do as owners and officers and all that stuff. All right, so we're back at zero people we can cover. Then if there are no employees, okay, then you're you're left up to your subs. So what we run into is we don't have. Carriers, especially standard carriers, who will offer workers comp when there are no employees because basically what it ends up being is is a dummy policy or a policy that doesn't cover anyone. It's called dummy because there really nobody covered. It works. It it benefits the insured because you can show having a workers comp policy on a certificate of insurance if you're ever asked to supply that. But the rub is finding someone that will carry it. Now we can write those through the North Carolina Rate Bureau. I think the the way they work they have a standard deposit premium of 1500 unless that has changed. Not sure it has. I've not written one in a couple years, but. But I don't I don't know that I said I wanted us excluded so I don't know. Okay. Well. Like I don't know. That was my. What that I don't know what yeah I don't know what that. Excluded means. I mean we wouldn't be covered. You wouldn't be covered right. But so why why would we do that? You know if we're going to have that coverage why would we exclude us. Well the reasons to do that would be class of of of your job your occupation class because some classes are much more affordable than others. Okay. Let me go back in there and look at Joe's notes to me on that. Okay. Okay. That's just how I thought and I might have just read. We may have discussed that because I mean I get so confused like maybe that's you know how we talked about it and I. You know didn't interpret that way or I'm not remembering it correctly. I guess for me it's like what's the best way to write it like I don't. You know I don't want to chins out and just because you know I want it cheaper
