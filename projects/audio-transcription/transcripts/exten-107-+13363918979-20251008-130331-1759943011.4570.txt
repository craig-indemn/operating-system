Thank you for holding. This is Cecilia. How can I help you? I can say yeah. This is Lina. Yes, man. Um, I know you sent me over the quote, the homeowners quote, and you had the dwelling said at um, three hundred and forty thousand. Yes, man. Is that? I'm just asking, um, because when they sent me over quotes, they had the dwelling at three hundred and two thousand. Is that anyway? We can drop that down. Um, give me just a moment. So on the video, I went over. I explained that the company is based on the information we have from the home square footage, your build, bedrooms, bathrooms, how many stories, brick house, basement or no basement, all of that. We put in the system and then that shoots out what we call a replacement cost estimator amount, and that's that three forty number. So hang on tight, we can review what I have. And see if we can bring that down. But once we put that information in there, I can't go any lower than that. Okay. Whatever the system tells me, it has to be this much. Then um, I can I can't go any lower. All right, so I've got one story. It's a brick house with a basement, right? Right. Okay. I didn't see that the basement was finished, like set up as another you know playroom or sitting area or anything like that, correct? Um, it has a room down there, but it's not a whole sitting basement. It's not. Yeah. And as a is it one fireplace or two fireplace? Um, to be honest, um, we got the fireplace, um, taken out, um, because it was separating from the house. And I put that in my contract for um them to take out the fireplace. Okay. But it it did have one in the basement, but it's not that we are used. Okay, so um then it's got like a little small open porch in the front and a deck and then an enclosed area porch patio thing in the back, right? It's got a sunroom and a um and a deck, yes. Yeah. And does it does it use gas heating? No, it's a electric. Okay. Change that. One full bathroom, one half bath, right? Correct. Yes. Uh, is it mainly hardwood or carpet or vinyl flooring? Um, if if they got carpet throughout, but hardwood under under the carpet, yeah. Okay. Bathrooms have um vinyl or tile. Um, I wonder if it's tile. Okay. Along with the kitchen. Yeah, it actually. Um, does it that that opening is a carport right in front of the house? Yes, it's a carport. Not a garage. Yeah. Yeah, it. I mean, by updating some of it, I had it like at three thirty eight and something. Uh, three hundred thirty eight thousand and they came back up to three forty and five oh nine. By updating some of that stuff, because if you were to build that house today, um, it would cost the company three hundred and forty thousand dollars, if not more. Okay. Yeah. Okay, I'm just saying um because I did see this with uh three oh two I. I didn't know these numbers now. I mean, I can change it, but it's not going to bring it down. You know, three four hundred dollars because it's not like if if we went from the three forty to like two fifty or two forty, you'll you'll see a big decrease. Because it's still in the three hundred, it won't be a whole lot. Right. Yeah. Okay, like I said, I like your quote, um, because yours did have um. Flood in it and um. Yeah, it did have a little bit of flood. And then it's got we call equipment breakdown and service line. So like if your furnace goes out, if your AC goes out, other than a claim, we can turn in the claim. I think and that has a five hundred dollar deductible, so that would be covered. Oh, so y'all will replace that for five hundred dollars. Uh, right up to I think there's a a ten thousand dollar limit, and you out of for that you would only pay five hundred dollars if some if we were to replace it. Okay. Yeah. Right. Okay. Sounds good. I mean, I got a home warranty. They just let me know the home warranty came in. Of course, they won't replace it. Right. I can call y'all and have it replaced for five hundred. Correct. Yeah, you're five hundred. Yeah. All right. Uh, like I said, I'm gonna send this over to my um. Finance people, I think they're trying to put it in escrow. What I think they're
