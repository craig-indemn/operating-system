Novum Underwriting, this is Daniela. How can I help you? Hi, this is Gloria. I'm calling from the United States. How are you doing today? I'm doing very well. How are you? I'm doing great. Thank you for asking. Good. I was trying to reach out to Joel. There is an account I have been trying to get a word from him to see if it is something you guys can write. Because I sent an email in and let me call her name Mel Hamilton. Okay. Responded that he would have been he'll be the right person to communicate with to see if this risk will qualify on the wholesale side. Okay. Oh, is it is it okay if I communicate with you about that risk? Yes, so just really quickly, Joel is no longer with Novum Underwriting Partners. So I am covering his territory in the interim while we find his replacement. So yes, you can absolutely direct that question to me. Oh, thank you so much. Yes, I've been trying to get. I've been trying to get a response and it's just. Sure. Hard. So we have this account. You treat trailers, trailer cells of Mount Erie. Uh huh. I see they're located in Pilot Mountain and they sell and lease utility trailers and we're looking to see if there's a. Where you guys can accommodate the package, workers compensation umbrella. Is there room for that? Is this a risk you can consider? So when you say utility trailers, is that just like a standard flatbed trailer? Needs to be scheduled as rented equipment. I am not certain, but yeah, according to the producer, he explained to me that these people they sell and they lease trailers. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. Is it something like? Oh, what would you need? Is it something you can write? What would you need from us? Would you mind shooting that over to me in an email? Like if you have an accord form for me to review. Um, I cannot second try and work on that. Um, I just had like we went um. So what we did is we chose to reach out first directly or just by email to see if it's something that can be written without. Much effort while it looks like it's something you guys cannot do. I can shoot an email and we see um and then they have a very good website and you can just review and let me know if it's something you guys can consider. We can work on a quote. Okay. Yeah, definitely. If you just want to provide like a summary of what they do, that's that's perfectly acceptable. Okay. Um. What what's your good email please? Yes, I'm going to go ahead and spell it for you. Um, it's my first name Daniela D A N N I E L L A. And then a period and then my last name Odd A as an alpha W as in whiskey D as in Delta B as an echo. And that's at Novum UW dot com. All right, perfect. I'll send you one email. Okay, perfect. And then um, if you do end up sending anything to Joel, it'll end up getting forwarded to me anyway. So um, let me let me go ahead and give you my direct phone number just so you have that instead of getting routed through Joel to me. Let me know when you're ready. Alright. Okay, that's two one six. Five zero five. Seven zero zero nine. Seven zero zero nine. Two one six five zero five seven zero nine. That's it. All right, thank you so much. Thanks. You have a great rest of your day.
