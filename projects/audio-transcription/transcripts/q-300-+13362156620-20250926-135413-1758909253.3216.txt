Good afternoon. Thanks calling Alliance Insurance. Hi there, this is Lee Kump. How are you today? Doing fine. How are you doing, Lee? Good. I got a question. I've got my home and auto with Corbin. And in a nutshell, what I wanted to ask is, I've got one older vehicle on my insurance that I have loaned for a couple of weeks to our associate pastor at our church while he's having his vehicle repaired. And I just got to thinking, you know, it's just one thing for a day or two, but you know, what if something would happen and somebody would hit him or or you know, a freak accident would happen? I just want to check and see whether I needed to report another name that's driving on there or whether I'm just I really shouldn't be doing this in this day and time. Okay, what do you want to hear? That makes sense. Yeah, it does. Do you want to speak with Corbin? Well, if he's available, that'd be great unless you can answer the question. But if he's available, I'd love to speak to him. Sure. Okay, give me with just one moment. Okay. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance Services.
