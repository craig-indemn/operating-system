Hi, it's Joe. Joe, it's Rick Hendricks. How you doing, buddy? Hey Rick, I'm good. How are you? Should I say "top of the morning" to you or something in the Irish accent? No, I'm officially I'm officially back on on US US time. Yeah, Iowa feels like a millennium ago, but yeah, yeah, it was awesome. Thank you for asking. Yeah, yeah, I can't remember you're going to a football game, right? The Steelers and who they play. They beat up on the Vikings, or yeah, okay, I couldn't remember who they. I knew they won, but I couldn't remember who it. Yeah, was so that was that was that was good. Got the results you wanted, I think. Yeah, yeah, it was it was an awesome trip. Highly recommend if you've never been over there. So, yeah, what's fortunate that they go there a couple times over the years and it's been a long time. It's probably been you know gosh, 10 years or more. I'd love to go back and hopefully we can get my wife formally retired from her her job next year and free yourself to do some things like that. You know, I think I think Ireland is probably one of the more affordable places you can actually go. You know, yeah, and easy easy travel for yeah a bunch of English speakers. Know do language capabilities exactly. Kind of get used to the accent a little bit, but other than that, yeah, it was pretty pretty fun as I recall. Good welcome back. Glad you had a good time. Yeah, I just calling up on a couple of things on Christopher's desk. I don't know if you've heard the news of Money Duke is no longer with us. So he was sort of Christopher's account manager, and until we can find somebody to take his shoes up, I'm sort of helping Christopher fill in some gaps. And one of the accounts that we were sort of challenged with was this Armfield Civic Center, this recreation and fitness center that I think we've talked to you briefly about. Yeah, Christopher seems like hey Joe could look at it, want to probably pre inspect it, and I guess I'm just trying to you know help coordinate get down on your calendar with Christopher. See what your schedule was like and you know trying to get his schedule to match somebody else's like hurting cats a lot of times. Yeah, yeah, I hate to hear that about Amani and fix got the, been in blade to death done last and and told me that news about Amani. So yeah, yeah, that was yeah we do too. It was it was unexpected, but unfortunately, it's just you know it was a of his own doing kind of thing. I don't I don't think it was anything we could have done to prevent it. Unfortunately, so so anyway. So on this on Armfield, yeah, that's a trip to pilot. And is there is there you know any any any slots I could pin down on your schedule at this point, or am I better off just to let you try to coordinate that directly with Christopher? Well, the the plan was we talked on it. I am going to try and get it rated and put a price on it just to make sure it's worthwhile going down a rabbit hole. All right. Um and not rabbit hole worthwhile going out there and inspecting because it should just be a walkthrough with me just make sure it's you know passes the test everything's clean whatnot. So I do want to get a price put on it. Um, the first half of this week, but in terms of if if that means if we want to put a date on the calendar that lights a little bit more of a fire under me. Um, I'm pretty much wide open Wednesday and Thursday. Um, Friday I have something at one so early morning nine could work potentially on Friday. This weekend, okay, yeah, okay. Let me let me just confirm then. You said you got the Accord apps that I was able to send you. Yeah, yeah, okay, and a supplemental Christopher sent me a lot. Okay, awesome. So that so that's there. All right, let me do this then. If it's okay with you, I don't want to put up. I don't want to say yeah, let's shoot for one o'clock Wednesday until I talk to him. But let me tell him that you're pretty open Wednesday and Thursday. And if it happens early Friday, okay, I'm just gonna I'm just gonna copy you guys on a quick little email thread. He was traveling back up to Pilot Mountain as of about 15 minutes ago. So give him a chance to respond if you don't mind and and maybe maybe if you guys can put a date on the calendar between you know it'll it'll help you both to focus on
