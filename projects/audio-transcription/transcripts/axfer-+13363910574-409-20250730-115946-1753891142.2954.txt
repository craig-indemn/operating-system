Corbin. Hi Corbin, this is Arlo Larue. How are you? Good. How about you? I'm doing okay. So my insurance is coming due here probably I don't know in about a week or so. And I was just wondering does everything still look like that? It's probably the best policies for me. Let's look here. Appreciate you checking in on that Arlo. Let's see. Yeah, it. Eight seven. You look at the. You look at your home real quick. I wouldn't the auto's good that one's perfectly fine. The homeowners let me look at see for. Yeah, the homeowners last last year it was because you were saying well the roof is getting up there in age so. Yeah, the coverage um. Increase, like your. Coverage increased from three twenty three hundred twenty two thousand eight hundred to three seventy two. Um. You know what. Gosh, I'd love to. You mind if um maybe give me a buzz tomorrow? I want to run that auto rate just to be sure because there was a. An increase on the home and then I can if if the auto makes sense I can get it down fourteen percent and that might be a good thing. But we don't know until we check it. Um. And then if that doesn't work, I can just run. I want to run through that policy with you to make sure we got all the discounts. So plan on give me a buzz tomorrow. I should have all the quotes back. Okay, in the afternoon sometime is that good? Yeah, yeah, anytime. Um. And even if we don't touch base tomorrow, let's make sure we touch base early next week. We just need to make sure. Um. You know that's still the best option. It probably is, but I still want to run through it with you. But. Just call me and leave me a message if I'm unavailable. I'll call you right back. It could be you know one of these days it just gets slam. I get back to back to back to back. But if you leave me a message, I'll be sure to to call you back if it's. I'm sure I'll have time tomorrow. What's tomorrow Thursday? Yeah, tomorrow's only Thursday. I think tomorrow's Friday. Yeah, yeah, I should have everything back by then and we can finalize this thing by the weekend for sure. Okay, great. That sounds good. Okay, Arlo. Thanks for checking in. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
