Good morning, Dalia. Yeah. Good morning, Dalia. My name is Jamie. I'm an agent here with Alliance Insurance. We insure the property policy for. Let's see. I'm sorry. I think it's one one two nine one one one nine twenty third Street in Winston. Ah, yes. Okay. So so um unfortunately that that policy that's with the Ncjua. It it has canceled because they were looking for proof that you repaired your roof. Yeah. And when they didn't get the the pictures or the proof of the repair, they canceled the policy. Um. So I I was just made aware of this this morning that notice downloaded into my system. Um. I I just got off the phone with the Ncjua underwriter. And they will restate this policy. For you and get back in place, but they do want to see proof of a repair. Yeah. And then you just got to make a payment to catch the billing up. So. If I push you an email, could you reply back with pictures? Yeah. Okay, okay. Well then I I will do that right now. Let me just go check email for you. I've got. I've got www dot ester. S a r a i at gmail dot com. Yeah. Working email. Yeah. Okay, so I'm so there's two things here. There's also a statement of no loss that will need to be signed. I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna email you and just ask for pictures if you reply back with the pictures. And then I will also send you. A statement of no loss to the electronic sign. I'll send that to the exact same email address. It's going to show up from Conga Sign C O N G A. All you need to do is just open that email up, click and sign it, and then it will come back to me. And then once I have all that set to the Ncjua, you guys can call in. The payment, the money that's due to restate this is one sixty three. And seventy eight cents. It's actually two months worth of billing. That's why it's a higher payment. But. I'm gonna email you right here in just a few moments to get all this working for you. And you can let me know. When you made the payment and all that, and we'll put the same back in force for you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Any questions for me? Tomorrow to go. No, I I gave you this. Okay, good deal. Good deal.
