Thank you for holding. This is Anna. How can I help you? Hey Anna, this is Mandy at North Elkinshire. Hi, Mandy. I got your email with the claim number on there. Um. Our employee is sitting over there now and they still won't do anything for him until. The claims adjuster calls and answers some questions. So I don't know the next step to do. I mean he's sitting over there waiting now. And they won't see him until an adjuster calls. Okay. Is that something you can do or does somebody else have to do that or? I'm not sure how long it takes for them to assign an adjuster to the claim. Um, typically it takes about 24 hours for them to assign somebody. Um, or it could be sooner. I just let me check online real quick to see if they've done anything. Yeah, because he's I mean this is. One to two days is what it said. This is a second day. I mean if he don't have something done. Pretty quick. I don't know what what it'll happen after that. Okay. Let me take a look. Um. One second. Let's see if I've found anybody. Okay, so let's say they did assign an adjuster. Her name is Caitlin. And I can give you the contact information. Okay. Just let me know and you're ready. So Caitlin is the adjuster. Correct. Caitlin, I think it's Jimenez. Jimenez. Okay. Okay. And then phone number is going to be five six one. Three four eight five zero six nine. Okay, that's five six one three four eight five zero six nine. Correct. Okay, so I just need to. Call her and get her to call the orthopedic. Yeah, because I'm assuming what information are they needing that? I guess I mean what information are they needing? I don't know. He said there was a question like a whole page questionnaire that they needed. Okay, and it was insurance related. Yeah, it was they're waiting on the yeah workers comp adjuster. Uh huh. Okay. I've seen everything I have. Okay. Then yeah, they'll have to get in contact with. Specifically for the claim. Okay. But if you give her a call and she doesn't answer, let me know. I'll see if I can try to help as well. Okay. Well, thank you very much. You're welcome. Uh huh. All right. Bye.
