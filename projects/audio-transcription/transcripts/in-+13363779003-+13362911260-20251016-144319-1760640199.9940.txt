Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Ma'am, this is Annie Gnoiet from West Bank calling on a recorded line. I need to send Gary. I think she told me his last name was Belcher. Some information on the policy that he is writing. May I have his email address, please? Yes, you sure can. It is Gary. G a r y at myallianceinsurance dot com. You spell all that out. Insurance dot com. All righty. Okay, I will send it right over. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good day. Me too. Thank you. Bye.
