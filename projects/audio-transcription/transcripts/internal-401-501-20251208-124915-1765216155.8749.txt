What's up? How are you? Oh good, how are you? Oh, I thought I was too this morning. Whenever I got here at like six something six o'clock this morning, and I was sitting here like my nose was all stuffy and. Yeah, I just felt like I was taking on the cold, but I feel better now. I took some ibuprofen. I'm gonna go. I don't know. I'm gonna log out and go to Walgreens here in a minute and get some alpha elsters and see if that clears me up. But yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. What's up? I wanted to tell you. You want the good or the bad first. No, no, I want a bad. I just got cussed out, Jamie, like big time. Like I've never been cussed out before in my life. Like this lady just cussed me out. Does come see if you wanted to call her maybe. No. Simple answer. No. Call the same answer maybe. Who was it? So she went over. Well, it was going to be a new client, but damn, I don't want to write that shit. Or she's like that. No, hell no. No. Well, then she went to Winston Office. And Gary, he bound. He was having trouble. He's not familiar with PIN. Yeah. So he bound the homenado and he couldn't get the umbrella for nothing. So she ended up having to leave. She said she had to go pick her daughter up. From school, so he never could get it bound. So I could go to call her, Jamie. And was like, "Hey, I've got your umbrella ready. " How are you wanting to? I mean, I couldn't get the full minutes out, and she just laid into me. Oh my god. So then she hung up because she fucking canceled her policy. She canceled her policy. Effective, so no listen to this. Her renewal was the seventh, which was on Saturday. What's this lady's name? Let me look at it. Where you talking. Jamie Blacklock. She canceled her policies with Farm Bureau last week. Effective, effective the seventh, which is when that policy was to renew. Right. So really, there was no need to cancel it. She should have just. Not renewed, you know they could have rescinded the renewal offer. I guess I don't know, but she said no. They they she signed a cancellation form. Okay. Okay. Well, I never bound the policies prior to Saturday, right? We have been back and forth. She says I've had ample time to bound these policies. No, I had to get approval from underwriting, and then she's hard to get in touch with. She said she she can't usually talk till after five when the offices are closed. So of course I give her my phone, my cell number, and it's like, hey, Tammy, I'll work with you. You know, I'm I always work late after hours or on the weekend. So of course we were out Friday. Yeah. Shit just went all crazy. Anyway, I go to bond it Saturday with him, and of course their systems are down the whole weekend. Oh, I know. Yeah. But I was like, we were talking Saturday night, and I was like, you're gonna be fine. Like I had quoted it for the seventh. When I get in on Monday, I can go right in. You will have insurance, and they will honor it on the seventh. Right. Yeah. Like no, well she she didn't understand that at all. She she just didn't. She was like, my daughter is going to have to drive to school, or I'm going to have to take her on Monday because we don't have insurance. Okay. I texted her. I texted her at six forty-eight Jamie this morning. Yeah. And said, "Hey, do we need to write these policies? Could let me know something because she just went ghost on me Saturday night. " I even said I would write a policy to National General just so it would give her some reassurance that she would have. Yeah. Yeah. She wasn't having nothing. I mean, she was just oh my god, poor Gary. Oh Lord. I hate it. I hated it. I did. I did, but he said she wasn't nothing like to him. She didn't want nothing to do with me. It was all my fault. I mean, I've worked with this lady. She sent me her stuff last. Week before last, last last Tuesday or Wednesday. Of course, we were closed Thursday and Friday for Thanksgiving. And you know, I've had a lot of shit going on last week. So I apologize to her. I was like, I am so sorry. Yes, I mean you know Had to shut up. And I heard, cussed me out for like five minutes and then she hung up. I wasn't good cussed. Really, you can. Oh god. I'll stay for him, honey. No thank you. So um. Well, so anyway, I just wanted to share that with you really just because we were I said I hope Jamie's here when she comes in. Because she's probably gonna come in and cussed me out in person after she gets their daughter. I mean, well, now listen, now she does have it. Is she? I mean, she she needs coverage. You know, I mean. Oh, for real. And I tried to write her. I was gonna write. I was gonna write our policy Saturday night. We were on the phone talking Saturday night. And. Actually on Saturday night, but I sure think what's working. Well, but I I yeah anyway, so until the next the good news. Okay. I got the house. What? Yes. Are you serious? I am serious, been serious. Yeah, hell yeah, congratulations. Yes. So what happened? You know we were there at the party Friday. Yeah. And and that's that's probably another part of what happened with this family too because this all happened with me. And because I was planning on leaving the party early, coming back to work and trying to get this shit wrapped up right. Yeah, yeah. Well, that didn't happen. The guy, the wife's good realtor, called me. That had the house and well. We we were just standing there talking. Think you were there too, and then me and Christopher Christopher came over and he was talking about it. And then I went to the bathroom and I came. I was in the bathroom and I had my watch on. Didn't have my phone on me, but I had my watch and I just saw Kyle's wife call me as soon as possible. So I came out of the bathroom and Christopher was standing still, standing there and I was like, "Oh my god, Christopher." Um, I said, "I just got this message to call Kyle." Wife's good. I said, "He's probably gonna tell me that, hey, you know you were the next house bidder. If you are interested, I got this other property coming up. You know, blah blah blah." He's gonna try to say yeah. And then I was like, "But he might just say, hey, that deal didn't go through on the next house bidder." I said, "Let's pray that that's the case." And he was like, "Okay." And he sit there and prayed with me like he put his arm around me and we sit there and he prayed in a little prayer. And he was like, "No, go get your phone, take it back in the kitchen because the music was going, you know it was loud in there." Yeah. And he was like, "Just take your phone and go to the kitchen and call him." And I did, and I sure not that's what he said that they didn't want to sign the contract. They were being kind of shady and stuff. So. Yeah. Oh my god, that's amazing. So then he was like, "Of course, time is of the essence and." Because see, they had twenty four hours, but like I said, they never signed the contract. So then he was just waiting. I guess. He had to get the contract drawn up for me. Huh. Was there any good? There was this money on the table there. Like tomatoes, I have it. Who cares? You know, that's it from. But um. Um yeah, I have no idea, but um. So anyway, he sent contract to me. But he had to draw it up, of course. So that took a while. I mean, he was like, he said, I should have it sent over to you within the next hour. I was like, okay. So. We just sit there and kept drinking. I should have came back to the office and write our policy. But anyway, I was too like beside myself and just you know me flustered and everything and couldn't believe it. It was like surreal. But anyway. Um. Because I was I was just gonna sit there and wait on him to send me the contract so I could see it. I didn't want to be driving when he sent it. But anyway, he he finally got it and it was later than what he expected. But. I finally left the party. I guess it was five thirty or five. No, it was before then four. Four three. It was four thirty. I think. Yeah, because I think we had it till what three thirty and we kept saying, "God, they're gonna kick us out." But it was me, Christopher, Morgan, Amanda
