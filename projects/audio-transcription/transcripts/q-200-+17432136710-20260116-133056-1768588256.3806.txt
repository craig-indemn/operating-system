Morbin may help you. Hey, um, I wanted to ask for a policy, a quote on a policy. Sure. Uh, what kind of insurance would you look for? Uh, I was looking for the. Uh, liability. For two vehicles. Give insurance with us now. Uh, my mom does. Your mom does. Bonami, yeah, Bonami do. What's her name? Her name's Viviana. Diaz Garcia. Viviana. Uh, there it is. Yeah, Viviana Diaz Garcia. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. And do you have insurance now? Uh, not the moment. I have two cars with no insurance. Okay. And and why is that? I have to ask. Why not? Uh, I had the insurance for one of the vehicles. It's um, I had it um with the friend, but he uh he took off the. Insurance that he couldn't get no more insurance, so so I have to like get the insurance now. Oh, he had on the friends. Um. Yeah. Okay. And are you homeowner or renter? I'm home, uh, live at home. You live with Viviana. Yeah, I rent here with her. Okay. Um. See. We got her with travelers. Um, the only way we could do it is if you paid um. In full, is that okay? In full, uh, what do you mean? Since you don't have any prior coverage. Okay. Uh, so you can't do liability. I can, but we we could only accept full full payment. Full payments. Uh, like a down payment, you mean. Uh, like the whole term at once. Whatever it costs. I wouldn't be able to finance it. Finance. Yeah, you would be able to pay it. You just it'll be just a one pay plan. Does that make sense? Oh. Make one payment. It wouldn't be a monthly thing. It'd be a one time. In full payment. So okay, okay. So not I can't do monthly. I can only do a one payment. Right. Okay. Um. If you needed a payment plan, I can give you a number to call. Oh yeah, yeah. That'll be uh, that'll be much better. You want a payment plan? Okay. Yeah. All right, call this number three three six. Seven three six. Yeah, seven six eight. Seven six eight. Twenty one oh seven. Twenty one oh seven. Yeah, and then once you get insurance for six months or so, give us a ring. We might be able to help you. We just can't do it if you don't have any prior. Okay. Okay. And the only the only way we would have done is since your mom's here with us. We would make an exception there. So. If my mom was uh present. Yeah. So if my mom give that give that number, I call and they'll be able to help you. Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks for checking.
