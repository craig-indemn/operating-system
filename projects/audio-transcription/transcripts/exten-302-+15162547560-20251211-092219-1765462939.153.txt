Thank you for holding. This is Donna. How can I help you? Hey, this is Edward with New Tech Bank. I just wanted to get back to. I had some other questions, or also some answers for you. So, looks like that business personal property insurance. My team is saying, just needs to be the value of the asset set. She has, which I guess is seventeen thousand. Okay. And then, I think on the like all the other policies that she has, where the coverage is is adequate. It looks like we just need to be like added on the policy. Do you know if like she's already done that or if that still has to take place? Yeah, that part's easy. We can get you guys added, or you just need to be added as as what, like payee, mortgagee, or. So on the workers comp, let's see, we need to be a certificate holder. It looks like is what they're saying there. Yeah, that's easy. The molestation insurance, let's see. As additional insured. And and I can provide you exactly how they want us to be listed on there. I don't know if you know Rebecca already gave that to you at all. Yeah, she did because it looks like you guys need to be listed as an additional insured on majority of all the the whole entire policy. For the general liability, the property, the molestation, and then the workers comp is just listing you guys as a certificate holder on on a C O I. Yes, okay, so we're on the same page there, and then the business personal property is the insurance that she now needs to get because she doesn't have it. And then you're gonna up the workers comp policy, as well as the molestation insurance, but that one's a little trickier. Yeah, because she like I said she currently has one hundred three hundred and I'll send the request in to up it to one million. I just don't know if the carrier will accept it or not. Are you guys okay with getting it at the one hundred three hundred for right now to be able to close or it has to be a million to close? I'm pretty sure we'd need be a million two million aggregate to close. Okay. So just based on everything we need, how long do you reasonably think this is going to take? Just I can, you know, bring it to the closer so we have an idea on how we could push it if we need to. I can get the workers comp and the seventeen k and all the additional insured added today. It's the molestation one million that I I don't I don't know how long the carrier is going to take to review it. Like I said, we already have her fill out the application for it. I just have to submit it for them to review. Because like I said, they they don't typically like to up coverage mid term. So I'll see what I can do with them, but that's the only thing I'm gonna be holding it back. Okay. But I just need to get in contact with them and get a time frame so I can give you a more accurate answer on that. Here in a little bit once I get in contact with them, but everything else, so we'll be good to go today. Okay. All right, thank you. I appreciate you. Yeah, you're welcome. All right, thank you. Bye.
