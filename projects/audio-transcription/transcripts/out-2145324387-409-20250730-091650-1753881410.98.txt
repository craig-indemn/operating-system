Oh, perfect. Can I get her name and then I'll quote it up for you. Yeah, it's Lauren. L a u r e n Neil N e a l. And her date of birth. May thirtieth, nineteen ninety nine.

It is five thirty. North Patterson. Unit six seven six. You know what? Seven what? Six seven six is the unit number. Okay. All right, that's Winston Salem. Two seven one zero one. All right. Perfect. And um, I'm probably going to need. Yeah. Let me get her. Well, I'm in another. It's just her as a driver, right, Lauren? Yeah. Okay. A twenty four Lexus ending in. Oh, it's two. Two thousand twenty five Lexus. Twenty five. Okay. And what's that? Um, is she single and married? Single. Single. And then. She licensed in Texas now. Yeah. And I have her license number. Is the last three seven one zero. Yes. And go ahead, go ahead, and give me um her past address. Or. Okay. Uh, it's four eight zero seven. Riverside Rd. E. S i d e Drive. Dallas. And then our zip code is seven five two four four. Okay. Dallas, Dallas, got it. And. She's been driving since she's sixteen. Yes. Perfect. And um, excuse me, the VIN number for the Lexus. Okay, it's a two T two. G G. C. E Z. Zero S. S is in Sam. Yes. C zero S C. Zero seven six one six three. All right. Two thousand twenty five Lexus NX three fifty premium. And would she be driving that to to work or school every day? Less than ten miles or over ten miles. Probably less than ten, right? Less than ten. Yeah, she just goes to the hospital and back to her park. Yeah, figured. Is um, and what? Is the car being financed? Do we need to put a lien holder in here? Yeah, there will be a lien holder. It's not leased, right? It's the. No. Okay. Okay. Who's that lien holder? I think it's Truist. Truist. Okay. Okay. And I'm gonna put full coverage on it. Is there any coverages of mine that you guys want? Oh, I don't want the bottom. Um. So what are my options? Looks like um. You guys have 500 current split limits. You have 500 North Carolina just. I'll give you the. Um. Does she need renters insurance or anything? Yeah, she's got it, but I think it's through the apartment. Would that help? Yeah, it'll help a little. But um. Yeah, I can. If we got that, that would help her. But I'll. See. So the limits in North Carolina, you're. You're one, two, three, you're four limits up. So the minimum now is 50, 100. But the level that we like is the 100, 300 for their minimum. And then the next, so that's level two. Okay. And then there's one more level: 25500 and then y'all's at 500, 500. So you want to? You want me to quote the 100, 300 or? Yeah, let's do that one and the 25500. Okay. Yeah, I can give you prices for that. In that way. And then you want med pay. What? Um. I'm sorry. If you want medical payments as well, that's a that's a line item. A lot of people use their health insurance if there's an accident. You got some coverage there. I don't think so. Okay. And then we've got AAA, so we don't need the towing and stuff. Oh good. What about deductibles? Do you want to do like a low cop deductible and then a 500 on collision maybe? The the cop deductible. There's two deductibles in North Carolina. You have a comprehensive and a collision. Okay. And the comprehensive is pretty inexpensive. That's why I always want to go with a low deductible. If there's a windshield break, there's nothing out of pocket. Okay. Um. So I'll quote a zero deductible there, 500 on collision. And then I'll just do a 50 rental car reimbursement. Um, if she's in an accident, they'll give her a rental car up to 50 a day. You could go to a 75 a day or a hundred a day a day, but we start out at 50. Yeah, I think 50 would be fine. On the collision, can the deductible go any higher? That that would help help out any. Yeah, yeah, I'll tell you. So. Let me run a motor vehicle report. I can give you all. I give you a baseline like. The base would be. See. And there's an app you can they have too that you can add on your phone and leave it running. It gives a 10 off. I don't know if she'd be interested in that, but. Just remember that's available if you want that discount. It's 10. It's called Dynamic Driver. It just. You know you leave it running all the time and it doesn't affect your rates. It's just a discount program to improve driving. I mean, you don't have ever have to look at it if you don't want to, but. Just a way to save a little bit. Okay. Um. All right. So I ran her record. It's clean. So the rate's coming in with those limits. I did 100, 300, 100. And. I did uninsured and underinsured same limits. Zero cop deductible, 500 on collision, 50 rental. And that rate is coming in at. 2, 080 dollars and 46 cents is the paid-in full price. And that's a six month or a year. Year. Twelve months. Okay. And then if you wanted to go to the next level on liability, the 25500. That would be paid-in full 219961. Okay. And then if you wanted the. Thousand dollar deductible on collision that would increase. I mean that would decrease the rate. By. Looks like about 170. A year. On both of those policies. Yeah, just figure on 170 roughly. Well, I mean so. If you want the number, the number would be 2, 035. Dollars and 61 cents with the 25500. And then the 100, 300 limit. What's the higher collision deductible? Would be. Total of 191646. So. Not
