Good evening, Maria. This is Maria with Alliance. Hey, Maria, Bill McCuller. How are you? Oh, good, Bill. How are you doing? I am good. I just listened to your voicemail. I am traveling again today. Okay. So, the information that is being requested by the underwriter for the umbrella policy. Yes. What what what would they like from me is a description of what occurred on those two incidences. Yes, that's all we're needing. Okay, is that something I can call them and talk to them because it's fairly detailed. If you could put that in the email for me, that would be very helpful. Well, that's what I am trying to avoid because. Because one of those instances was an attack on my daughter. Oh gosh. An assailant who was in the car trying to steal it when she happened to step open the door and he was in the car and tried to stab her. Oh my gosh. Yeah. How. He destroyed the entire. He he was stealing it, so he tore open the. Oh, the wheel area, the steering wheel area. And so that's one reason why we. Okay. Well, anyway, it was a. I don't. What were the dates again? I can't remember. I have to pull that back up myself. Let me take a look. I think I have it right here. For Kylie, that was May of twenty twenty three. I mean, it just if you could just give a brief, it doesn't have to be. Just they just want to roughly know. Okay, so in this case for her, I would just probably put in you know vehicle was being attempted to be stolen. Well, you know, come to think of it, I think she does it show that she had two instances within a pretty short time period. That's the only incident that is showing up on the report. For her. Okay. Does that show as being a? That that there was just property damage. That doesn't give me any other information. That's why I am asking. Yeah, that's what happened. Yeah. Okay. And yeah, I guess I don't really have time to sit in front of a computer and type stuff. That's that's that's the problem I am having with all this. That's okay. I can I can take care of that for you. So Kylie. Okay. So when they when they tried to get in the vehicle, she was in the vehicle with. At the time. Oh, well, this is what's interesting, Maria. The person stealing the vehicle was in the vehicle, laying down on their back in the front seat. And she, the she, she parks in a parking garage. And so, when she went to use her key to open the door, she pulled it open. He was laying there. She surprised him and he tried to reach out to stab her. Oh gosh. To get her away from the car, which she did, and then he ran away. I got you. Okay. So she surprised him. So it just it just he caused the damage to the car. He caused the damage, right? He was stealing. He broke open the steering wheel hub area. The hot wire of the car. Okay. Okay. I got you. I mean, there was significant damage to. Yeah. To it, where it couldn't be driven, and then it was at the Kia dealership forever. Right. And they were a royal pain to deal with as well. Anyway, it was it was a fiasco, but she got through it and she's much better for it. Oh god, I am just glad she's good. I mean, that's scary. I can't even imagine. The heart was behind her and grabbed her by her. Her collar of her shirt and jerked her backwards just in time before he. He had the screwdriver in his hand and he was prying all the all the shrouding off of the steering wheel column. Yeah. When he got surprised, he lunged at her, tried to stab her in the in the in the belly. Gosh, dog. So yeah, and unfortunately, this kid was only fourteen years old. Oh, you are kidding me. This is crazy. That is just crazy. And what happened with your accident? I'll take care of filling all this in. Yeah, and that and that accident happened in twenty four. Yours was yes, February of twenty twenty four. Okay, so I was backing out of a parking lot. And my left front wheel rolled over the curb, and it high centered my car. My left side of my car. Okay. And so that was the extent of it. Okay. So it ran over the curb and and it. What I am sorry. Yeah, go ahead. Ask you the question again. I want you to. Put it in your words.
