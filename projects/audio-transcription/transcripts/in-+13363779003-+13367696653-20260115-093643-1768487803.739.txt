Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. I hope you. Hi, how you doing? I was calling to get insurance for my car. Okay, you currently insured somewhere else. No. Okay, in order to get a quote here, you have to have insurance. Um elsewhere else, they won't be able to quote your car. Okay, thank you. I was just trying to get insurance today. I'm sorry, what was that? I was trying to get insurance today. Okay, so. But you said we have to. I have to have insurance with somebody else. Uh huh. Oh okay, thank you. Uh huh. Now you're fine.
