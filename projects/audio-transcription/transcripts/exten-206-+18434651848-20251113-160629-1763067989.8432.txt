Hello, this Jeff Edmonds. Hello, Mister Jeff. This is Tom. Yeah, hey, how are you, sir? Good, sir. We mailed the check long time ago. Sorry, got the confirmation to say you did not receive the check yet. No, the check wouldn't have come to us. I don't think the check should have been sent to auto owners, which was the company. I'm looking at the email. It looks like what you sent was something for the Catawba County Tax Collector. You you sent me an email that had certified mail receipt included. Both receipts, sir. I think that my manager she put on one picture, but but Catawba and the other one too, sir. Auto owners, I mean, maybe she might have mailed it to the directly to the auto owners. I'm not sure, sir. I think I didn't see the address exactly where she mailed, but you did not receive. No, no check was received. Matter of fact, I responded to the email with the pictures asking for clarification, and I stated on that email that the policy had been canceled and if there was interest in reinstating, we could have possibly done something about it at that time. That was back on October the sixth. Sorry, sir. I thought maybe that because my my tenant, I think he wrote the check under. I think my manager she took it and she mailed it. I think. But I'll tell them to cancel the check, stop payment and write another one, sir. Mail it to you overnight. That makes sir. No, that we we don't have an option anymore. We we can't continue the policy canceled in September and we we don't have an option to rewrite the policy any longer. It's breaking up, sir. It's breaking your voice. Yeah, I was just I was just saying we we can't we the policy canceled effective September the second. And we auto auto won't yeah auto owners will not reinstate the policy nor will they rewrite it. We don't we don't have another option for coverage because it's been canceled more than 60 days and there's nothing else we can do on our end. We haven't we haven't heard from anyone in over two months and we actually reached out a handful of times prior to when it canceled to get payment. I think Shana got involved in this at some point back in October. And there's just nothing we can do on our end. And where did the check went, sir? Either you are auto owners. I have no neither of us received a check. Auto owners did not receive it because they don't show any payment and we did not receive it or we could have perhaps posted payment depending on when we got it. It doesn't look like anything was mailed until September the 29th and that's again all I see are these receipts. It doesn't show what was actually mailed and to where. So I'm not sure that this is not very helpful as far as what we got. But but no one received a check. Auto owners did not get a check and our agency did not get a check. Funny, sir. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. There's just nothing we can do with. I'll tell her to go to the piece and see that. I mean like you said they cannot reinstate. I mean like a re. Right. You said completely that they don't take the policy you're saying, right? That's correct. We don't have anywhere else to go with the policy. So they had to find the tenant has to find some other. That's correct. Yeah, that's that's correct. That's why I tell these stupid people to to just do it auto drafts. That's the problem with these people. They just stupid. Yeah, I understand that generally works the best, but not not everyone like you said is is willing to do it that way. So. Okay. Thank you, sir.
