Hello, Jackie. Hey, Jackie, it's Brandi. Sorry, I missed your call. Oh, hi. Yeah, I just texted. I was like, "I just call me. I promise I won't move." No, I. I seen the number and I was typing and I was like, "Okay, I'll get it on the next ring and then I didn't pick it up fast enough." Yep, yep, that's fine. So. Hey, how are you? Good. How are you? Good. I decided I. I woke. I get up every morning. I go to the gym at five o'clock and I woke up this morning at four ten and it was pouring rain and I thought I heard thunder and I just went nope and rolled over and went back to sleep so. I decided after my doctor's appointment I would go ahead and run to the gym so that's what took me a little longer. No, you are fine. Yeah, I was just like I don't want to go out in the pouring rain. I am sorry, I just don't want to. I don't blame you. Yeah. So anyway, um. So who is this auto? I like that again. Shoot, that reminded me of something else too. Um. The auto ins auto owners insurance. Um. The fifty. Oh no, I am sorry. I pulled up Megan's wrong one. Um. The fifty thousand dollar one for me with the ten k. Ten k. Okay, yeah. I think that's the one I wanted to do. Two forty two a month. Yeah, because I did the math and it's only let me see two forty two point four three times twelve. Nine minus. Oh. Twenty eight nineteen. It's like ninety dollars more for the year just to do the auto pay. So. I think I can do it all. And then you have it for ten years. You know you pay on it for ten years and after that you don't. And it's done. Yeah, then it's done and you have the fifty thousand. Okay, all right. Yep, let's let's just go ahead and do that one. Okay, no problem. And see. All right, just going to verify a few things through this application to make sure that everything is correct. I have a date of birth at eight eighteen sixty four. Yes. All right. No, are these the actual numbers or are these? Is there going to be a medical test or is it going to change or are these actual numbers? So yeah, so I had quoted you standard. So this is on the higher end. You will have to do a blood test. You are in. If everything comes back good and of course they're going to pull your medical records. If everything is. Big and staying good, they'll bump you up to preferred, and this could actually be a little bit lower. We will have the option if we get the price a little bit lower. You can up the coverage then. Okay. So that is a possibility, but I always like to do standard because we don't know exactly what's going to come in. For everything else, so we'll just start out here once you do all the tests and auto owners will call you. To set that up. Okay. Most of the time they'll ask you to go to your house or they might ask you to go to a certain doctor's office to do it. Either or you'll set that up with them once those tests get back because this this is like a month long process especially if they're waiting on medical records from your primary doctor. Okay. That takes a little bit longer. Okay. So. What is your current height and weight? Five foot four, one hundred and sixty seven pounds. All right. Taking any medications. Yes. All right, and what medications are you taking? Um, I am taking Montelukast, which is a generic version of Simular. I take um. Zyrtec every day. I take Altorvasatin, which is Lipitor, every day. Um. I am currently taking a pill called Contrave for weight management. Okay. Now all of those are just pretty much like. I know the. Uh, you said Lipitor. That's like uh for. See their blood. Okay. It's for yeah, it's for cholesterol. The cholesterol wasn't super high. It just you know. Brandi, just wait. When you get to a certain age, every conversation with the doctor starts with "Well, at your age, " and I just want to slap on so. So it wasn't like it was, obnoxious. They were just like, "Well, you know, at your age, it starts to go up. " So we may as well just cut it all. I am like, whatever. So. Well, if I think this will make it easier for me because it All right, and in the past ten years, have you used cocaine, heroin, LSD, marijuana, PCP, or any narcotic illegal drug? No. All right, and no to tobacco, correct. Correct. In the past two years, have you traveled or worked outside the US or Canada in the past two years? I just went to Canada, but that doesn't count, right? We're saying the US and Canada outside of the US and Canada. Yeah. Yeah, so like. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I just went to Canada, but other than that, yeah, no. I am sure that you are not on trial for anything for any other or any crime or misdemeanor. No, no, not today. Nor have I ever been. Have you are you currently a member of the armed forces or military or entered into an agreement? No. In the past five years, have you been convicted of driving while impaired or intoxicated? No. Delaire misdemeanor. And that's a no. Okay. And. All right, so what we'll do is I'm going to go ahead and get your banking information. We'll put it on file. Nothing gets taken out today. Once we get the approval of everything, and they give us time to figure out you know if you get a lower price, can we increase coverage things like that. Then we will set that up, but at least they have something on file that way I don't have to get your wet signature on anything, and delays the processing. So do you want to do your checking account or savings account? Checking. Okay, and what is the routing number? Zero five three one zero zero four six five. And checking account. First with four zeros, zero zero zero zero. Five eight two two seven zero eight one four. All right, and what day of the month? Of course, depending on when this. All get set and done. Yeah, what day of the month would you like to set it up on, and we can always change this. This is an easy fix. After. The fifteenth. Yeah, the fifteenth. All right, and the last thing—well, actually, two more things. Okay, so for your beneficiaries. I always say you know definitely have a primary beneficiary. You can have. I got that already. Okay. The other thing is is that if something were to happen to your primary, I would also think about having a backup. To the primary, so we don't have to add it today, but just okay cool. Megan.
