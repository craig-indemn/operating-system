Thank you so much. Hello. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, sir. Hi, sir. This is John, the Spectrum Business. How are you doing today? Doing great, sir. How are you? I'm also fine. Thanks for asking. Can I speak with the manager or the owner here? They're in a meeting. I can get you to the voicemail. No, no, no worries. Like, did you call me the good time when I will call you back? It's difficult to say because they go in meetings in and out and they go and and do all to the other officers as well. So I couldn't tell you. So you take my contact number and whenever he will be available. So call me back already. That's that's why I'm leaving you giving you the voicemail because he'll check it and then call you back from the voicemail. Because I don't know when I'll see him because he's in and out. All right. Give me one second. I'll get you to the voicemail. One second. Thank you.
