Um, is this Alliance Insurance? This is Alliance Insurance. Let's go by. Hey, sorry about that. I thought I had the wrong number ball again. I've got a couple little issues. I just got my policy and they still got a Dodge Ram on my account that I come in there and got that policy in my dad's name and paid for his policy in full for six months, probably about two or three months ago. Yeah. And it's still on there. We need to remove it. Okay, give me one second. Let me get it one of the agents so they can help me remove that for you. Okay, one second. Alright.
