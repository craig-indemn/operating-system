Hey, this is Brian. Leave a message and I'll call you back. Hey Brian, this is Brandy with Alliance Insurance. I was giving you a call because I sent you over an email regarding your umbrella policy. I'm thinking that we should move that to USLI, and I sent you a quote with that as well and just explain some of the coverages. If you would please just give me a call back. I won't be back in office until January 5th, but your umbrella policy doesn't renew until January 19th, so we do have some time. But I did want to just go over that with you. So if you could give me a call back the week of January 5th, that would be great, or just respond back to my email. We can pick a time and day that works best for you. Whenever I'm back in office, but just give me a call back, let me know. If anything, have a great Christmas and a happy new year. Thanks and have a great day.
