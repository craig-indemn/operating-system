Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hi, is Taylor Scott available? I believe she is. Let me see. Yeah. Would she? Mind telling? Yes, thank you. This is Lee Everidge and I've been at the DMV today for six hours. Oh my gosh. We need to make sure Ethan is on the policy, which I don't know how we would have not done that. And he he's an underage driver getting his permit, but today we're getting his level two and he has to show he has to be on the insurance in order for them to let him do his driving test. Okay. So if you can throw her on, we can do work magic. I'm going to have her email something to me and I can go print it off for them. So this day is not completely wasted for us. Right. Let me let her know that you're on the phone. That way she can get your call. Okay. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance Services. We appreciate your patience and we will be with you shortly. While you wait, please take a moment to.
