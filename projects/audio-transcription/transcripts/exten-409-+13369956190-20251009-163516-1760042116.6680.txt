Hello. Hello, Carbon. Yes. Yes. Yeah, it's me, Ricardo. You asked me to call you around for college or something like that. Yeah, thanks for coming back, Ricardo. Let me look, see where we're at with this thing. Man, I finally got an update. I don't have any update yet. It's not. They didn't respond. Um. Can you give me till tomorrow? You want to call me back tomorrow? I'm so sorry, Ricardo. Yeah, shoot me about ten. I guess they're out. There's a lot of people out of their office. They went to these meetings. They still should be responding. I'm surprised they haven't. But yeah, sorry about that. Hopefully. You find me. Yep. Okay, sounds good. Thank you, man. Okay. Bye, bye.
