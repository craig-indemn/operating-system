Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hey Brandi, it's Kurt Snyder. Hey Kurt, I just actually emailed your wife back. Okay. Um, I did get your message that was left. Um, that was uh, actually sent to me. Um, and I started looking at it this morning. National General didn't resend or cancel the policy in appropriate time. So that is what happened with the payment being taken out. But I um talked to them this morning and told them that it needs to be canceled and the refund needs to be sent out. And I was assured that you would get a full refund. Now it would take up to I would say seventy two hours. So I'm thinking if it's not in there by next Wednesday, please give me a call and I'll go right back to National General. Um. Okay. And see and figure that out. Yeah, they totally cleaned up my whole checking account. I am so sorry. I was like, "What? I was like, why I have zero?" And then I saw, I was like, "Oh, I just happened to check my bank app last night and I saw that I was like, you got to be kidding me." Yeah, so I mean, I the policy is now canceled and the refund is pending right now. I'm um. Since your account is still on there, it should be direct deposited into your account. Yeah. Okay, okay. So I just wanted to you know talk with somebody and make sure that we were moving in the right direction. On that. Yes, I'm taking care of it and I'm going to keep an eye on it. Um, and as soon as I um, of course, I won't be able to see anything today. But Monday, um, I'll check on it first thing in the morning. Okay. Okay. Okay. If they got a date on there, on when it because I'll be able to see that it's transferred. Okay. But you may not be able to see it on your side yet. So at least I give you a heads up that it's about to happen. Okay, all right. I'll I'll keep an eye out, but thank you for working on that. Yeah, no problem, and I and I do apologize for their mistake. Yeah, I know because we sent them. We filled out the paperwork. Yep, you did sign it and I sent everything in. And just sometimes the cancellation takes a little bit longer than normal and. I don't know why it took that long to be honest. Yeah. But I do apologize for that. That's okay. Tell Corbin I said hello. I will. He's uh, think he's actually out of office today, but I'll tell him whenever he gets back on Monday. Yes, yes, I I miss coming in person, and back in the day. Well, you can always stop by. That wouldn't be a problem. Well, we live in Asheville now. Oh, okay, yeah, that's a little. Yeah, yeah, but we used to live in Louisville. We live in. If you come on this side. Yeah, I know, I know, but anyway, just tell Corbin Kurt said hey. Okay, I will. All right. Thanks a lot. You're welcome. Have a good day. Okay. Okay, you too. Bye. Thanks. Bye.
