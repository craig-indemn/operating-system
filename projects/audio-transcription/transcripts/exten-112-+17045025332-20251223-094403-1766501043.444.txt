Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Brandy, this is Richard Joyce again. Yes. When I send this picture, the letter, it comes back. It doesn't show us delivered, and it comes back and says this this is junk. Can you look and see? Can you can you see? I have it. Um, I have. It looks like you've sent something three times. So I have your picture. Okay, then that's that's the main thing I'm after is that you do have it. And yes, I did get it. I don't know why it doesn't show my end that it's delivered. I'm not sure. I'm not either. I'm. I just barely can use this phone. Well, I did get it, and I will text you and let you know whenever the FS one has been sent. Okay. All right. Thank you. Have a good day. I'm sorry. Thanks. No, you're fine. You're fine. Have a good day. You too. Bye bye. Bye.
