Hey, Edward, how are you? All right, Dana. Dana, I gotta go to court, uh, the twenty-sixth of this month, and I requested a letter from Dairyland or Century or whoever they are. They got three or four names. Uh, I needed a letter of liability, uh, that they paid for this gentleman's truck. So when I took it to court, it would be dismissed. Okay. Well, Edward, um, let me let me see if you want um. Do you want me to put you on hold for an agent and they can get that sent over for you? Because I just kind of do the billing. I don't really do that. Um. Yeah. So I can either yeah let me put you on hold um to make sure when when are you going to court? The twenty-six. Okay, okay. Yeah, that should that shouldn't be no problem. So hold on. Yeah, because I I called the insurance and and all they sent me was just the insurance card sign I was you know had coverage. I need what they call a liability certificate or something from the insurance sign they paid for that guy's truck. So when I took it to court, got it with a sort of issue. Like really, it was my fault. They had to charge somebody, so he charged me. But he said, "I bring that letter to the court, they will throw it out." You know, as far as me paying a fine and stuff. You know. Or they want to know what the guy's truck paid for. You know. Yeah, yeah. Um. Okay, Edward. So let me put you on a brief hold so I can get you over to an agent. They can get that sent over for you. Okay. Okay. Hold on.
