Yeah, mate. Hey Joe. Hey buddy, how are you this morning? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing great. Left your message yesterday, so we played a little bit of phone tag. How would you beat trip? I think you just headed to the beach last time I talked. It was good. It was good. We uh we pulled a real lazy weekend. I think we went out of the house to go eat couple times, uh and that's about it. To the beach twice. We need that every now and then, don't we? We do, we do. The bad thing is I'm starting to like it too much. Well, listen, I'm starting. How was yours? Was the ball game good? Yeah, man. Great time. We're big college football fans. Big kickoff weekend, you know. Our team won. So we'll take it and we enjoyed it. I didn't, you know, one thing that kind of surprised me when we left here. We live in Pilot Mountain. When we left here, we we I thought we hit it the time of day. Gooey. Let's hear about two o'clock a little before two. I thought we'd be through Charlotte well on our way down 85. With with little to no traffic. Boy, I was wrong. I I mean it was. It was. Y'all left on what Thursday? No, we left Friday. Friday at about two o'clock, and I just assumed well you know I'll get through Charlotte before four. And we're we're on our way, and brother that wasn't the case at all. A lot of people traveling on Friday. Have mercy. It it took us about. Almost two hours extra from what I you know normally do. Yeah, we we did really good. I mean, but you know we left Wednesday afternoon probably about five thirty. Yeah. And drove down and it was great. Sunday, well not Sunday, Monday, Monday coming back. Traffic got a little thick, but not not nothing that really slowed us down a whole lot. But yeah, we we we actually hit traffic pretty good. But yeah, I could imagine Friday traffic was probably pretty bad. A lot of people traveling for the weekend, which a lot of people you know they'll leave on Friday and then they'll take the whole next week off a Labor Day. Yeah, yeah, I thought we. Yeah, a lot of people do vacation. But we weren't. But I did send you that email. Maybe I got your email wrong, but I sent it out last Wednesday. Yeah, I've never gotten that thing. Well, what I have is Pro Works LLC at Yahoo. Yes, sir. That's that's that's that's correct. Yep, that's correct. So I you know what it's it's it's my fault Joe and I have to apologize. I'll call my wife now and have her check that because I haven't even checked. We was out of town and I I was I don't know what I was thinking. I was thinking it was going to come through to my uh email here on my phone and that is a different email. That's the Daniel M Lowe email. So I did probably get it. I'm sorry about that. That was I didn't. I wasn't even thinking. That's right. Let me let me do this. Put it at the top of the email pile. Let me resend it to Pro Works. Can we try the other one too? Uh no, it's probably come through to the Pro Works. Uh, you can send it to mine too. That way, just in case she says she don't got it, I'll forward it to her off mine. But my my personal email is Daniel M Lowe. At iCloud dot com and that's no caps. Daniel M Lowe L O W E. Yes, at iCloud dot com. Yes, sir. And if you'll send it to that, if she says she didn't get it, then I will just forward it from that email to her. All right. We should be good. I'm hitting send now. Just let me know what you need. Thanks, sir. I appreciate you. Yes, sir. Talk soon. Thank you. Uh huh. Bye.
