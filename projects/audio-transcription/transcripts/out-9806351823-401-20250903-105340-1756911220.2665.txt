Hello. Hello, is this Shirley? Yes. Hey Shirley, this is Heather Scott with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Doing good, good. You had called. I believe one day last week, unless it's a message. Has anyone got in touch with you? Regarding some insurance. Okay. How can I help you? I need some insurance on the house. Okay. Is it currently insured? Not right now. Okay. When did you purchase the home? My mom purchased it in nineteen seventy nine I believe. Okay, how long has it gone uninsured? Just about about seven maybe nine nineteen months. So. Okay. Yeah, unfortunately, I'm not going to have a carrier. All of our carriers require you to have continuous insurance, and no more than fifteen days lapse in coverage. Okay then. Yeah, but thank you for calling. You're welcome. Bye bye. Alright, have a good one. Bye bye.
