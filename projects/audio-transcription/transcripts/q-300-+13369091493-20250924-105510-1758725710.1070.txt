It's a great morning of lines insurance. This is Jamie. Hey Jamie, I'm calling to see if someone can give me a quote if I add another car to my insurance. Yeah, I can. I can certainly help you do that. So my phone system has pulled me into Shana Dillard, 61 Whitney Road in Moxie. Is that what I'm speaking with? Yes. Hi there, Shana. Give me one second. Let me get this policy up in here for you. Okay, here we go. Okay, I've got an active policy for Shana Dillard, 61 Whitney Road in Moxie. There's currently a 2015 Chrysler 200 on the policy. Would we be adding a second vehicle to that or? Or we replacing the Chrysler. Adding. Adding. Okay. Have you already bought this vehicle or are you going to buy a vehicle? Just taking a second. I've not bought it. Yeah, I'm considering purchasing it. I just need to you know get all my eyes and talk to you before I do so. I don't blame you there. I got you. Okay, so in that case, I'm going to use today's date as an effective date just to give some hopefully easy math there. Do you have the VIN number of the new vehicle? Oh yeah, I do. Hold on. Yeah. Hey, and then. Well, of course now that I have it, I'll just take a second. One second. Okay. They may not be it. Okay, it is one. G N E Z D K W four L J three one six seven four. Okay. It's pulling a 2020 Chevy Traverse. Yes. All right. Okay. So is this vehicle going to commute back and forth to work or school? Um to work. To work. Okay. Do you commute more or less than 10 miles to work? More. More okay. All right. So 10 more miles and. Okay. Are you going to have a bank loan on this vehicle or you think you'll pay cash for? I don't need a bank loan. Bank loan. Okay. All right. So if you have a bank loan, Shana, the banks gonna require you to keep full coverage on the vehicle. Looking at your Chrysler, you currently have a 500 deductible for comp and a 500 deductible for your collision. So just for ease of. Just for ease, there will make that match. Would you like rental or towing on this Chevy Traverse? No need. Okay. All right. So. Let's see what it's gonna be coming up here. All right. So this policy just renewed on August 16th. It's an annual policy, so it's gonna run until August 16th to 26th. So total for the year, it's gonna add 2, 986 dollars and 11 cents to the whole annual premium. All right. It's gonna bump as of right now. There would be. It's showing me now if I submitted this for you like today, the money's gonna recalculate. But as of right now, 802 dollars and 33 cents is showing me what the monthly payment is. Moving forward, but to get there, there's an endorsement down payment of 248. 74. Okay. There's the next payment would be 553. 59 and then moving past that it would be 802. 33. Now in the event that you didn't have the 248. 74 sitting in your pocket right now, I could submit this as is. The system would still give you three days to make a payment on this thing. I don't know what that money would be until I push that button to move it forward. But for the sake of this conversation, just a quote. I'm gonna tell you about 805 dollars a month. The figure of monthly payment if you added this. Now what? Now what if I replaced it with this car? You mean get rid of the 2015 Chrysler. Yes. Yeah, let me back up here. I'll tell you that too. Okay. Let's see 2015 Chrysler. Okay. Okay. So if we replace the Chrysler with the new Traverse, policy date stay the same. It's still gonna stand for us until August 16th of next year. The money's dramatically less. Okay, it's gonna add a total of 1, 215 dollars in additional premium to the policy. So there'd be an endorsement down payment of 101 dollars and 21 cents due today. The next the next payment due would be 391. 25 and then the future monthly payment would be 492
