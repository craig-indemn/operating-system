Sorry if you are holding. Cody to help you. Cody Bill Edwards, how you doing? Hey good, how are you sir? All right. Um. What will my insurance be on my 3B vehicles? If I just keep, I just use the other round on the farm here. I don't need any comfort anything on the 2004 Trailblazer. I just need the insurance. We're talking about the auto policy. Yes. Okay. I thought you had already moved out of the farm bureau. Yeah, but they haven't sent me the paperwork. I wrote them a check, but they said I could get my check returned. I don't have all my insurance. Are fits pretty close, and what happened was I was going to save by a thousand dollars. But then they said they were going to start. They send me a 300 more fifty dollars every six months, so that would be about seven hundred more damn dollars. What's that for? Well, he said they didn't look and say where they had the accident. Oh, they didn't even run the motor vehicle record. Well, see that's what he quoted. Now I said, "Hey, that's why I'm calling." He said they hadn't sent me any information, any any policies or anything. So I said, "What are they doing? Wait until right time and time then they're going to jack me up." So I called their ass and said they'd be sending me. It would be the 1100 and some dollars like it was. For six months. Uh huh. Well, it's about 13. I'm just saying what tell it was. 1300 every six months, so it's like 2600 a year. Yeah. Now a thousand less than this one, which is 3600. So then now they've run the motor vehicle record report and then it's gone up 350 every six months. I have to send them 350 or this. After this six months and 350 next six months. And next, well, the next six months could technically go up too. You don't know about that either yet either. Because they just do six month policies, right? They don't do year long policies there. No, I know it. Um. Let's see. So all we're really checking is if we take the comprehensive off the Trailblazer. Yeah, and see what, and then with my discount because I got my farm and everything else. What's the cheapest rate I can get? My automobile and keep it down and keep everything together. All right, so that that makes it go down 105 dollars to take off the comprehensive off that vehicle. So you're at 3488. 34. Hold on, let me write this down. Uh huh. 34 what. 348880 if we take off the comprehensive on the Trailblazer. Okay, hold on just a second. Well, with that extra money, I think I'd be saving about 400. If I had it with Farm Bureau. Yeah, you said 700. They were at. You said they were at 13, and then it was going to be another 350 each. Hold on just a minute. I may look at my checkbook here. See, well, I paid it. Well, and one other thing, Bill, you got to factor into this is if you keep your auto here, then your home doesn't go up 292 dollars either. Hold on just a minute. I'm looking here, my. You're all right. Take your time. Okay. I wrote him a check for 1, 183 dollars. Okay, and then if you went up two cents. 1, 182. And there's two. Yeah. And they say it's going to go up another 350. He said 300 some, but I don't know if it just straight 300 or 350. So I mean that would put you at 1500 and something every six months. So that puts you over 3000. And then if we took the comprehensive off the Trailblazer, that was 105 off. If you kept your auto here, then your home doesn't go up 292 dollars. I mean it might save you a hundred to a hundred bucks or so. To switch the Farm Bureau. Yeah, because I mean you'd be at like 3100 and then. This is at 36. It might be like 200 bucks savings total, and plus you don't know what Farm Bureau is going to do next term next six month term either. It's it's completely up to
