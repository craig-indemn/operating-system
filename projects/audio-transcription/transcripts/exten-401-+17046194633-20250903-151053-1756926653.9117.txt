Hello, this is Heather. Heather Robert Vaughn again. Hey. Hey, I'm going to be the the craziest client you've ever dealt with. I'm still working. Now I look at this and this this scares me because it's too cheap. I'm sorry I didn't. What'd you say? I said. What I said, I this worries me because it's too cheap. I mean you know the. Oh oh oh okay. Okay, now this is you know now number one and and listen you know I don't know what I'm doing I sold real estate in the past but I've never sold insurance so I don't know anything. Now one thing I don't like is I don't like this this company name of auto owner's insurance. I you know I mean doing a house I mean I would prefer to do something. I mean if it had been you know it could have been one of. Twenty five names you know somebody like Progressive Farmers. Okay. All right. You know a company that we we know. And another thing about it, you know you've got the the dwelling limit on this thing is 392. And I would prefer it to be something like 425. Okay. Now the the you know they're kind they're a little bit let me explain we had we had a smaller house up there. We built on to the house, put two rooms that added about a thousand square feet to the house. And I don't to be honest with you I don't think Carroll County has got it straight. How you know I mean they the house had a building permit and they passed the permit but to me they kind of screwed up with their data and I'm certainly not going to go to them like it's it's be telling me telling them hey I want a higher tax bill up there you know. Right. But anyway I would like the dwelling to be like 425 or something like that. And. I'm just going to walk through it while we're. While you're telling me. And of course whatever you know these what I'm sure the computer gives you these. You know this personal property and everything and it probably has some formula to it. It's the percentage of the dwelling. Yeah. Yeah. But now I can drop it because this is your secondary home right. It is and I have no. I mean I think this thing is realizing that you know I don't have a mortgage on the house. Okay. So I dropped it to 2125. I increased coverage A the dwelling to 425 and I dropped coverage C the personal property to 2125. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Um. So. Um. Let's see now the deductible and what was the deductible I I look at so much. 2500. I would prefer the the deductible. The. A thousand. Yes. Okay. Okay. I bet you don't have many people too. No, they do. They do. Yeah. Yeah. You know I want to feel comfortable about the thing you know. Yeah. And have we gone? Usually have you know. It's usually more. It's usually they're like I don't believe my home. Worth that much or the replacement cost you know but just keep in mind the market value is different than the replacement cost. Right and this is a very unusual house. I mean I I wish you could see the house. There's probably not a house. There's 60 or 65 houses in in this development. And I guarantee you mine is as far as you know. Interior of you know like moldings and stuff. It's it's not the typical house but you know most people would probably want more of a log cabin for what they want but mine's not that way. But now is it a log cabin? No, no, no. I said most people prefer a log cabin. No, it's saying prefer a log cabin for you. Okay, got you. I was like I don't I don't think I call that a log cabin. Okay. Alright. Um. But yeah. Um. So yeah I I up the deductible or increased it. Yeah. I changed the deductible from 25 to a thousand. Okay. All right and then increase the um. The dwelling. Okay, and have we got somebody? I mean, you you you are agents for a lot of. I mean, you are independent, I guess. And. Right. So have we got a, kind of a company that you know you. Used to hear in any. So unfortunately, no. We write all most the majority of our business is written with Auto Owners in Cincinnati. Um. They have been around since like nineteen nineteen sixteen. Out of Michigan. Right. They are one of our top rated carriers. Like I said, Auto Owners, Cincinnati, Penn, Penn National. Those are the main the three that I typically try and write with. Now we do have Travelers. Travelers don't do it unless unless you have Auto to go with it. And that's the thing. Most of my carriers, Safeco, Liberty Mutual, you've got to have another line of business. Right, I understand. They won't. They are not writing just a monoline home. Right, I understand. I understand that. So that's why Progressive won't write it at all. They're they're not in that market anymore. Hey, well, did you mention? I'm sorry. But we I mean we we do write with Progressive, we but not homeowners we write with. Liberty Mutual or Safeco. Travelers. Trying to think of somebody else you might more familiar with, but yeah, I'll tell you Auto Owners and Auto Owners Penn National. And Cincinnati. Okay. Who my go tos are and and Liberty Mutual, but like I said, you got to have. Got to have part. Right. Another. Yeah. Okay. So I mean, do you do you like this Auto Owners? You prefer them over the Cincinnati. They're they're there together. They're my top two. Yeah, I don't prefer one or the other, but they are over the other. I would I would feel totally. I mean, this is is is a highly rated company. The Auto Owners. It is. And Cincinnati is the same. They won't take it unless we got another line of business. Right. Okay. So I that's why I said I'm limited to so who I can quote it with whenever it's just. Just one line of business. Okay. Okay. And I and the way this thing is, I'm I'm a little bit confused that the coverages that apply on this sheet. Now is that saying that? I mean, what what is that? What are these things saying like refrigerated product coverage? I mean. Now those um you don't have to have those those are just some of the common endorsements that we add on to the policy. They're not necessary. They're not included. In the standard policy. Um. And and like I said, if you don't feel like you would use any, I know this is what your secondary home. Yeah. But yeah. You know I don't. Are we saying that I've got these items? I mean, do all of us. Okay. We'll look at that extra expense per month. I mean, I. You know I don't have a mortgage. Um. Now something like this tree debris removal. Thousand dollars, you know, in the mountains that might be. I mean, that is that the maximum what we're saying would be the maximum limit on. Yes. Okay. That. I would probably need to go up to several a couple of thousand dollars on that. I mean, if you got the ability to do that. I don't. Let's see. Hold on a second. Let me look back. Because you're in Virginia and some of these kind of. Um. They're they're a little bit different than North Carolina, what I'm more familiar with. Um. There's different forms for Virginia. Let's see. Yeah, that's the max that they will. That's the max on the debris removal. Okay. Now on this glass breakage. Um. Is there a max? I mean, it's what it doesn't look like I've got a figure over there under the limit. Is that. What was that again? What was that for? Glass breakage. It says two fifty's. The deductible, which is fine. But I mean, what is there a max on that? I don't know. I don't even see that. Let's see. I'm in the policy. I'm not looking at the quote that I sent you. I'm actually in the the carrier's website. Um. And I'm trying to find the glass. Where do you see that at? Yeah, coverages that apply. You know it's on the first page at the bottom of the first page. You know it has it's got coverages that apply. So that's that's what it says. Glass breakage. What are some of those? The mastic appliance, seepage or leakage, increased costs, endorsement, personal property replacement cost. Yeah, I see all that. All right. Is this glass breakage is the one right after trade debris removal. Gotcha. I see, I don't see that, but yeah. I still don't see it, but not on this where I am at. But is there a limit? Well, that's what my question is. It doesn't look like there is. I mean, it says 250 deductible, but it doesn't look like there is a limit. I mean, there is a limit. Okay. I mean, that's what I was going to ask about the limit. I see. I can find what I need because it looks different in the policy. Right. You all pan know I notice one here says equipment breakdown coverage. Do you have any idea what that? Yeah, now that's like any like your HVAC if it was to go out, but it now can't be due to wear and tear. It's almost like a warranty. Like on your appliances, there. Right. Okay. But again, sometimes people you know it. Most of them do the wear and tear, right? Or you you have a warranty when you purchase it or whoever you know. But similar to that. Yeah, this service line coverage. Yeah, that that's going to be like. Like the water line or power line. Yeah, going from your house to the the public utility. Okay, okay. All right. Well, if we I guess if we if we can just up the coverage of what what we you got it now when. Um. Send that to me and let me. This is this is annual right. Oh yeah, it is. Okay. Did what, Betty? Are you in an HOA? We are. I wouldn't call it an HOA. We're in a you know a. Shall a high corporation you know or we don't have an HOA. Would you call it an HOA Betty? You know they don't do our they don't do the mowing and they don't have any cat they don't have any. You know, don't paint your house every so often or like you know like a lot of HOAs. I mean, it's just you know it's just a it's just kind of a group of the homeowners. You know they it's the rules of the you know what you can do at the. On the on the you know on the when you are in the property you know. Well, I yeah well I guess it is an HOA, but you know it's. Yeah, it's about three hundred dollars a year. I mean, it's not you know I mean they they got common area tennis courts. You know, you know different stuff like that roads. You know the. But it's not like some HOAs, but I guess I guess it is. Does that make a difference? Well, no, I am just looking through some of these coverages like the equipment breakdown and service line. Did you did you want to keep that on there? Like all these additional. The reason I asked that and the reason I asked that. You know we're getting from the power company we have Appalachian power up there. I mean that's the name of the power utility. And you know they're sending something all the time trying to add on to your bill for covering you know if the if the power line breaks or something you know covering the the fee from the transformer to your house and all that. And and I am just trying to find you know I. They even worry me down here in Charlotte about that. I mean the Duke Power even does that. And but if you have it on your insurance, you certainly don't need to be paying it again. You know. Exactly. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Now that's the only reason I ask about a lot of these things. I think people don't realize they they they might have it on homeowners. They only realize they have it. You know. Right. Yes. So what was that premium sent you earlier? The primary premium you sent me earlier was taking the paid in full discount off. The premium before that was thirteen twenty seven point ninety two and then they give you a one thirty two point eighty one discount for paying full discount and. Premium would be eleven ninety five eleven. See, it says new premium after making those changes adjustments. We dropped the deductible down to a thousand increased to four twenty five for the dwelling. It's thirteen seventy six eighty five. Okay, so I mean it really didn't make, but about
