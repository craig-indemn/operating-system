Hello, hey, Susan. It's Jeremy. How's it going? Hey, Jeremy, I'm okay. Good. How did the game go last night? I'm not sure who wanted to tell you the truth, but tonight's going to be. Yesterday was JV, so it wasn't a big game. But tonight's going to be a much bigger game. And my daughter's football team won something from T-Mobile, and apparently T-Mobile is going to be there tonight and they're going to have. Something special for the football team and they're going to have bounce houses for the kids and all kinds of stuff and. This is going to be a nightmare. But were y'all busy at the concession stand last night? Well, yeah, I mean, for a JV game, it wasn't bad, but tonight will be nonstop. There are times last year, especially when they play. I'm not sure who they're playing. I think they're playing Mount Erie tonight, and if they are, they are rivals. So it's going to be big in that respect. And there are times during the intermission where the line at the concession stand and we have two windows open. The line goes all the way back up to the field. So it just it's it's going to be nuts. It's going to be nuts on a good night. On a good night, we do between eight and ten thousand a night in the concession stand. Holy smoke. That's a lot of hot dogs. It's a lot of hot dogs. Yeah, oh my gosh. Yeah, anyway, I did. I was going to say it's good weather for that. Tonight, well, so far it doesn't look real good right here right now. It's looking like this all day. What the weatherman said, and but that cool front's come in. So it's it's a lot nicer. I'm good with. Yeah, cool front's nicer right now. It almost looks like we might get rain and king. But of course, that has nothing to do with pilots. So I got you. All right, I did manage to find what I was looking for. And just a comparison. We said yesterday that the homeowners I was paying 999 and you quoted 600. And that's for the year, correct? Yes, ma'am. Okay, then what I found out here. The Honda. Oh, and I what did I do with it? When that. All right, for six months on the Honda, I paid 56191. Right. And six months on the other three, I paid 94023. So you got it doubled up. Uh huh. And what did you write those down by any chance? Just now, as you said them, I did not. No, I wasn't tripling. What was the nine? What nine? What? 94023. Okay. And 56191. We need to add those together. All right. And then add them and double it. Okay. Oh come on, that's the calendar, Jeremy, not the calculator. They both start with the same. So that's 3004 dollars and 28 cents a year. Okay, 3004. Right, I kind of ballparked it at 380. And mine is six is 2136. And 36, so that's 867.92 cents cheaper on the auto and the home. It's 406 dollars cheaper. Yeah. So. So guess what? Well, and I ran the umbrella too for you. I didn't put that in there, did I? Yeah, I ran a umbrella a million dollar umbrella. For 340 dollars, I don't know if you wanted that or not. I just built it in. It's fine if you don't. Yeah, I'm still. I'm not sure on that one. I'm not exactly sure what the value of you know that is. Of course, until something catastrophic happens and then you wish you had it. So there is that, and the way to look at it best is okay. Look on the the lawyers that are out there right now are always going for the maximum dollar. They're going to sue for the maximum dollar. That's all we hear about. And so if your coverage of 100,000 dollars for one person is exhausted, then this would give you another million dollars. Yeah, and 100,000 dollars doesn't kind of get you far if you're talking about medical procedures. No. All right. Not at all. Well, even with that, with what I'm saving, I'm still saving money. Yes, ma'am. Yeah, you're still saving. Even if you put that in there, you're still saving
