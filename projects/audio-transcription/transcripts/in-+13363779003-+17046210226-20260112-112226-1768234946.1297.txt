Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hello. I'm just trying to figure out if my insurance payment went through. Okay. What name is the insurance in? Jack Bailey. Okay, let's look here. Take me just a moment to get it logged in. Yeah, it looks like it had it was due January fifth, showing as a payment due of two hundred and thirty dollars and forty eight cents. Did it not go through? It did not go through. Okay, so if I call back tomorrow, am I able to get you to, switch it over to a different bank? Yes, because it's showing here it's cancel pending for you need to pay it by January twenty fifth. Okay. So as long as it's paid, so yes, if you call back tomorrow with that, we can get it changed for you. All right, sweet. I'll get all my info and I'll call you back tomorrow. Okay, that'll work. All right. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye bye.
