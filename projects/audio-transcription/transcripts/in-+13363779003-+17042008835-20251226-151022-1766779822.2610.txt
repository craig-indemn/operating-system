Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hey, my name is Laura Taylor. I'm with EHC Realty. I'm on my speaking list. This is Dina. Dina, hey, I've been trying to get a hold of Anna Joyce. I'm assuming she's off for the holiday. I've got a Thomas of the Essence issue with a property that I'm trying to get a clear to close on. Can you help me with it? Okay, is it a? It's a condo community. Okay, what's the name of the? The community. The community. Sir John's Hill. Is Sir John's Hill in Charlotte, North Carolina? And is you said it was a new property? Is that right? No, no. So you guys have the I guess the policy for the whole complex. Okay. You've got like a crime and fidelity policy. For the property. Okay. And that's what I've got, and so. The lender because of Fannie Mae, lender guidelines there's supposed to be a rider on top of the crime and fidelity policy that that covers the. HOA management company because of the new the North Carolina law. That you have to have that protection, and so I just want to make sure that that rider is on the policy because Fannie Mae guidelines require the lender to have a copy of that. Okay, okay. Let me. And I don't know if Dell Powell, Dell Powell's the president of the HOA, and I don't know if y'all been in contact with him, but he and I've been emailing back and forth last few days. Okay, let me put you on a brief hold. Let me see if I can get on. She might already be gone. We actually close at 3:30 on Fridays, so. Let me see what I can do. Hold on just a moment. Okay, okay.

Visit our customer portal at my. Okay, I'm sorry to keep you on hold. She's not answering me back. Yeah, I call her first. I call this morning at like 9:30 in the morning and she has not responded and this is a closing supposed to happen on Monday. Okay. Yeah, I really I'm I'm under the gun here. Okay, so um I was going to tell you if you can um can you send an email and then send it to Anna and then also Gloria can I give you those two email addresses? I could actually take it to you if that would be better. I've actually been emailing Anna. Anna got an email at 7:30 this morning that was so it would be on her just for sign this morning. So she's completely aware. I'm just not getting any response. And like I said, closing is Monday. Well, I guess closing's not going to happen because I haven't heard from y'all. So y'all are delaying my closing. Can you send? Can you forward that email to me and I'll see if I can send it over to another agent? Would that be okay? But they're leaving right. We we are leaving, but if you want to go ahead and send it over to me, I can say I can see if I can send it over to another commercial agent and let them know. What's the email? So it's the same as Anna's. It said just put Dina in front of it. D E N A. At my alliance. Hold on a second. D E D E N A. Uh huh. Yes. At at Alliance. No, it's my my. Alliance. And then insurance.com. My alliance. And I'll I'll see what I can do to get one. See if they can help out with that. I just I just send I include the attachments. So for my understanding, the Fannie Mae issue is they have a crime and fidelity policy, but they have to have a rider. For that policy to protect the HOA, whoever the HOA management company is. And I pulled the guidelines for Fannie Mae, and yes, it has to be a rider
