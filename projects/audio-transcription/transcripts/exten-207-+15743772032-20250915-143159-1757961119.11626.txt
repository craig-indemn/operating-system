Sorry, if you hold, this is Cody to help you. Hi, Cody Christina with Carolina Carports. Hey, how are you? Hey, I'm doing good. And you. Good. Hey, so I have Eduardo Hernandez. He is needing a certificate of compliance to the DMV. Certificate of compliance. For because he got pulled over in May. And they're requesting that because I guess failure to proof for insurance. We called the the county and they just said that that's what the. Yard the DMV was actually needing. Certificate of compliance. Is there a specific like form number or something for that? That they're needing. I'm not sure. Just on on here it says that and the the girl at the county said that you guys should know what it is. So that's why I didn't bother to ask. Every state is a little bit different. Obviously, I'm in North Carolina in North Carolina. I think what they want is like what in North Carolina they call it FS1 form. Um. Certificate of insurance. This is for the for the date of May 15. That's when he got pulled over. That's when he got pulled. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's just what Indiana calls. Basically, they're they're proof of insurance. Um. It says issued. Let me call Progressive. That's who is auto through still right. Yeah. Think well, yeah because it's Westfield, travelers and. Progressive. You said this was Eduardo Hernandez. Yeah, that's his truck. But I'm under under it too. I'm his girlfriend. So that's what I was going to ask since it um. How would it work? Does he have other policies? Because all I'm seeing in our system right at this second is. Progressive. It should be just progressively. Okay. I'm assuming probably it's like the commercial insurance what I'm talking about. Right. So okay, I'll need to call Progressive and see if they can just send me that form. You said that the date in question when he got pulled over was when. May 15. May 15. Okay, let me call Progressive and see if they can provide that form for me. Okay. Alrighty. And then I will. What's your email address, Christina? June j u n e dot a l. You cut out.
