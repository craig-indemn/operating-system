Yeah. Okay. Do you need something for me? Oh no. Um. Let me pull them up. Have you had a chance to look at them? That email. Yeah, with the proposals. The insurance proposals. No, I don't have the time. Just tell me what what is it. Okay, well maybe you got me because so you called me I believe when Monday. Yeah, Monday. Yeah, Monday or last. Uh huh. And you asked me to quote your home insurance and your auto insurance. Yeah, does the home insurance first, and then when I approve, I will be bundled with the. Auto. So yeah, I emailed you over the insurance proposals. That's what I was calling about. Okay. Just tell me because I didn't have chance to. To look up my email. Oh, okay. Um. Give me just a second. Let me pull it up. Okay. Yeah, and like for the um, I think for the auto. The auto policy. We still need your driver's license number for you and Christian. Oh, okay. I have it.

So, um, I can go back in and and update that quote for the auto insurance. Um, but yeah, this was um, I sent a proposal package with Penn National. Um for your home and auto. Um. To the home insurance, we would insure your home at six hundred and fifty one thousand. Um and the premium is one thousand nine hundred sixty four dollars. Premium is that yearly, right? It is. Okay. One thousand sixty four for the year. And then that's already with the bundle with the auto. So your auto, like I said, I would have to go. I gotta go back in and revise the auto. Okay. Because I didn't have your driver's license number. Okay. So that could change, but what I have right now. Um. And like I said, it I quoted it, comprehensive for both vehicles one hundred deductible and then collisions five hundred dollar deductible. Um and they also have towing, roadside assistance, and rental expense. And do you pay monthly for your auto? Yeah. You usually do the monthly payments. Yeah, usually. Um. One hundred something, but not two hundred, less than two hundred. The two hundred. Yeah, this one is like one ninety a month. Ninety something, right? One ninety a month. Yes. For you and Christian. Yes. Um, but like I said, I have to go back in and revise that with your driver's license because that could change. Okay. Um. Now if. Uh, as soon as I you will approve my bundle, I will call the. The State Farm to drop me for that auto, right? I just want to be sure. If we decide, yeah, not don't do that until we. Yeah, you decide right. Until we decide or buy the policies, don't cancel it.
