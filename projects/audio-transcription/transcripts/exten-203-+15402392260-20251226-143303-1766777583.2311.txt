Lions Insurance Services is Maria. Hey Maria, this is Jason Newman. I just missed your call. I think about the policy stuff. Okay, let me see one second. Okay, we had a missed call from you. You're wanting to you had some questions about your policy. Well, I mean, this has been a heck of a year as far as like adjustments and stuff, and I'm finally just kind of shaking up the numbers and was just just curious like just scenarios or how we can go about. Making sure that I'm getting the best deal because I think I bundled everything to get a pretty good pretty good deal and then. My tax assessment changed just with the way that housing market has been for for Davy County. Right. And so the coverage for the homeowners insurance has like been jacked up quite a bit. Along with I mean I know y'all aren't a part of the property tax increase at the county issue and it is what it is but just trying to see if. There's anything we can do or if this is really the best deal I'm looking at. Okay, so yeah, we've got the auto home and personal umbrella all with auto owners. So if you want, we can. Trusty, we're at midterm right now. Doesn't renew again until August of next year. Do you mind holding one second? Sure. Thank you. Eight three. Thank you for holding. We value your call and will be with you as soon as possible. Making a list. Hey Jason, sorry about that. Just wanted to confirm. Before, yes, right now we do have your auto home and personal umbrella with auto owners, and the thing is is if we try to requote or move your home right now, we probably need to move all of them or you can lose. Some huge discounts on the auto and the umbrella. Right, right. We try to move the auto right now in midterm mid policy period, then you'll be penalized. So the best thing we could probably try to do is if you do if you do still want us to try to quote it, let's look at it in July. I can set myself a reminder, call you in July. Right for it to renew and let's shop it with some other all of it together so we can't shop and get a better price overall. Okay, so these these penalties, you know, this fine print is insane nowadays. So the penalty would be what. The penalty on the autos if you try to if we canceled or moved it mid midterm. Uh huh. How do you what is the penalty for that? They do charge a higher rate per day for that. All right per day. So you're just saying it's basically it doesn't make I mean I'm going to be worse off if I try to change now as opposed to July. Yes. Okay. But we can definitely get this in July. Yeah, yeah. Um. Well, if if so, I got. All right, I'm signed up until July, and then we can reassess then. With some competitors and see what we can do. Okay, okay. And if you like for me too, I can go into the homeowners and quote with a higher deductible. And get that back to you if you like to look back. Sure. Savings that we'll bring. Yeah, yeah. Any creative ideas you have? I'm open to just to kind of review and see what that looks like. Absolutely, absolutely. Well, we will definitely do that. Okay, all right. Thank you so much. Oh, thank you. Bye bye. Have a good weekend. You too.
