Good afternoon. Thank you. Calling Alliance Insurance. Um. How are you? I'm trying to see. Um. I was involved in a crash. I need to do a claim, but I wanted to see if I could do it online. You guys have a website. Okay. Uh. Do you know? Is it what company are you looking for? It's the like I was a strange of information the police officer gave me. It's um, says insurance company Alliance Insurance. I have a policy number for you. Okay, we can look to see if it's one of ours. So yeah, go ahead with it. Okay, seven zero one, two five, seven four four. It was involved in a school. It was um involving a school crash. A bus. Yeah, that is not one of our policies. Is it? Is it by chance Alliance Insurance Company? Did it say company on there? No, it literally just says Alliance Insurance and then the policy number. Okay, we're Alliance Insurance Sur services. So there isn't Alliance Insurance Company. I think there's like an agent Alliance Insurance. I just don't know which Alliance you're looking for. Neither do I. So I'm just like googling and and see what I got to get this claim going because I had to leave the state. When um a few days after I was involved in the crash, but you know I'm gonna take care of the claim now. Okay. So you said Alliance Insurance Company. There is one called Alliance Insurance Company. It might be it, but it could be a different Alliance as well. There's so many of them. Okay. Thank you so much, man. Well, you're welcome. And bye.
