Thank you for holding. How can I help you? Hi, my name is Kevin Yar. My policy number is nine eight one three five six eight eight four. So I've been on automatic payment. And I needed to close two accounts, and I just want to make sure that when I get billed again on the seventeenth, that it it goes it it goes through the right account. Can you help me with that? I certainly can. Let me take a look here. Perfect. Let's take a moment to pull that information from their system. Okay, it looks like it is on a checking account draft. Do you have the last four digits of your account number? The last four digits of the account. The only other account that I have now that's open with Chase is oh shoot, hold on a second. I'll give it to you right now in two seconds. Okay. Nine six three two. And that is your current account. Oh yes, that is my current account. Yes. That is the one that's set up on your account right now on your auto policy. Perfect. Thank you so much. So we're not going to have a problem. Thanks so much. You're welcome. You have a great weekend. Thank you too. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye bye.
