Thank you for patiently holding. This is Amani speaking. Hi Amani, this is Emma calling you back from Penn National. Yeah, how you doing? Hi, how are you? I'm good. Good, I'm glad. I just wanted to give you a call back and let you know that if we wanted to change the payment plan to the 11 pay, we would need to take a payment of 680 dollars and four cents. Did you still want to move forward with that? Um, so you need it today. You I mean, if you wanted to, you can certainly I mean, if you need to speak to the insured, we don't have to do it today, but that would be the amount that we would need to change the plan. Yes. Okay, I mean, can we just make that his next month's payment because he's already made a payment, you know that was already due for this month. I did double check and have it run our analyst run by it. That's why I wanted to make sure I was giving you the right numbers and that is the amount that they advise me the 680. 04. So when would that have to be paid? I guess. That would need to be paid when the pay plan wants to be whenever you want to initiate that change. Okay, and that was how much. Six eighty. 04. So if I call back to get this change to say at the end of this month and make the payment of 680, then the payment does due right now. On September 9th, on September 10th will not be due. As long as there's 20 days to bill, then the bill will not be expected to be paid. No, but if the 20 days have passed, then we would include the next installment in order to change the pay plan. Okay, say that one more time. So if there's not 20 days for us to bill, then we would need the the following monthly installment. Well, you guys haven't billed this one yet. You haven't billed September yet, so I don't understand why you can't just go ahead and change the payment to 680. Change the payment for next month. For this plan, we wouldn't be able to do that. If you wanted to change it to 12 pay, that would not require a payment. Okay, let's let's just do that then. Okay, I'll go ahead and let them know that that you want to change it to 12 pay instead. Okay. Perfect, and just bear with me one more moment here. Great, okay, I'll go ahead and get that submitted for us, and you should see that change effective. Within 24 hours. Okay, all right. Thanks for your. Thank you. Bye bye.
