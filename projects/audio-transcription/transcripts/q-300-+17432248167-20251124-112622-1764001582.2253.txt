Thank you for holding. This is Holly. How can I help you? I can barely hear you. Um, I had a question about my policy. Okay, what's the name on the policy? Um, I'm with my mom. Um, my name is Karen Cisneros. Okay, what's your address? Uh, thirteen zero nine Brighton Street. Thank you. What's the name on the policy? Is it that name? Uh, yes, that's my name, but my mom's name is Maria Cendela Marie. All right, I've got that policy pulled up. What can I look at for you? Um, she wanted to know how many cars have the um, the full coverage. Okay, so the 2020 Honda Accord and the 2016 Nissan Pathfinder have full coverage. 14 Nissan and 04 Chevrolet have liability. Okay, um, and she also wanted to know why did her bill come up to 600. Let's take a look. Okay, so on October the 30th, the 2020 Honda Accord was added. Uh huh. So 446 dollars was added for that vehicle. Um, so that's the payment for October and November. Um, with the change added on that payment, so it's the regular payment plus. Um, from the 30th until the November due date. Okay, so how much is it going to have to be paid? Well, how much payment is it for all three cars? How much is it for every car? Uh, that 69423 is the is the payment for all of them. Oh, okay, okay. And it's the last payment on the term. So next month we should see what monthly payments going forward are. I could hear you. So this is the last payment on the term. So next month in December it renews. So we'll be able to see what monthly payments are next month. Okay, okay. Um, and what time do y'all close? Because she is getting out late today. We close at five. At five. Uh huh. Okay. Um, would y'all be open on Wednesdays? Yeah, we'll be here Wednesday. We're closed Thursday and Friday. Okay, I would let her know. All right, yeah. So that payment, um, yeah, it was from the 446 was added from November 30th or October 30th until the end of the policy, which is December 25th. That's why it's the 694. Oh, so the 400 was added because she added a new car. Yep, 446 was added from October 30th to the end of the policy, which is December 25th. So it's pretty much three months coverage for 446. Okay. Okay. All right. Anything else for now? No, that's all. All right, y'all have a good day. Thank you, you too. Bye.
