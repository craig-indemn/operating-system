Thank you for holding it, Gary. Hi, Gary. My name is Andre Bucan. Uh huh. And we have insurance with you. Okay. Car and house. Okay. I received an email notification that our house insurance is expiring soon and I need to work with you to obtain replacement coverage. Let me get this pulled up for you, Mr. Bucan. Okay. Hold on just a second here. It was probably with was that with one of the that was the main street policy. Uh, the letter is. Or NGM. It's from from NGM insurance. Yes. Okay. NGM has pulled out of the market in North Carolina. Okay. So so they're not going to be available to us anymore. Okay. So we will have to. Go through somebody other carriers and get some rates for you to get that renewal. Started. Now we've we've got plenty of time. I just need to ask you a couple questions. As far as the home goes, have you guys done any updates at the home as as far as the roof or heating or anything like that. No. Okay. So it's the same as it was on the old policy. The same yes, it was on the policy yes. Okay and what about any do you have any animals pools or trampolines? No. Okay. And with that information then we can go ahead and and run the rates for you now. It's probably going to be. We we are processing a ton of these so I don't want to. Do you do you pay the billing yourself or does is it through a mortgage company? We pay the by by ourselves. You pay the bill yourself direct. Okay. Um, I would say since it renews on the second. Sometimes I should be able to get back with you before the middle of November. Okay. And then that way that will give us plenty of time to get everything processed if you agree with everything. Okay, now can you check also our car insurance is expiring soon so we need to be renewed. That was going to be the next thing that I was going to tell you is if you want me to do it as a combination package then we could set everything up for that November the eighth renewal of the auto if you want me to check that as well. I mean I don't mind it to be the combo but if it's cheaper to do it separately so just for the price is right. Understand. I understand. I can run it that way. Just hold off on that billing. With the auto. Okay. And and I should be able to call you back one day next week. Okay. And with some numbers on this okay. So you will be handling this right. I'm sorry. You personally will be handling. I certainly will. I certainly will. Let me write down your name please. My name is Gary G A R Y. Gary. Okay. And we don't have any direct line so you would just have to call the main office number and ask for me and they'll make sure that you get sent over to me. I understand. Thank you. Okay. Yep. Very good. I will be waiting to hear from you. Like in the middle of next week, right? Yes, probably one day next week and most definitely by the end of next week. Thank you very much. Thank you. Have a good day. Bye.
