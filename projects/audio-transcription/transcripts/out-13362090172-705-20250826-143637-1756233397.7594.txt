Hello, Carmine is Christopher Cook. How are you today? How's going with Chris? Um, calling because Cincinnati believes you are healthy enough to get life insurance. I wanted to call and talk to you about the policy offer they got. And you've got time. Well, what did they find? Am I healthy or not? You are healthy. They said you are above average health, not premier health, a little bit of blood pressure and cholesterol, which I am sure you already knew about. Um, but above average health. So what do they offer? A million dollar thirty year term, so that's from now until twenty fifty five. Is six hundred and ninety seven dollars a month. Ooh. Okay. A couple things we could do is we could say, well, I don't want a million, I want seven fifty, or we could say, well, how about I do a twenty year term? That only takes you to twenty forty five. Um, but those are a couple of options to think about, or you could say, well, if they think I am healthy, I might as well buy more now rather than less. I see. Well, I am in a situation now that I don't have any business, so my income is like just, whatever. Totally understand. What can we have a sit down and talk about it because I am in the middle of something. I need to run some numbers. As far as I am concerned, what about if we keep it for the five hundred I have right now? For whatever the next thirty, whatever they offer, whatever. Yeah, I haven't any of those numbers yet because I wanted to get a feel from you on what was most important if it was the time frame. Um, or if it was uh, you know the face amount, and then I I run any numbers you want. I'll be in the Winston office Thursday after lunch. I am I am ready to go right now, but uh uh um I don't know man. Um time is important and and all those numbers are important as well. So. I don't know if I were going to be accepted or not because my blood pressure, which is under control, is not. Yeah, I mean, and they like said, usually when folks tell me they have blood pressure issues, I expect a standard rate, which is basically just average. Um, they gave you a tier up from that, a tier better than that, so it's clearly under control. That's a good thing. I was happy for you there. Um. So. Well, cholesterol. I am not doing anything about that because it's already there. I am not taking the medication which is not going to fix that. Yeah. I'll give you a dang medicine that makes you do you know it might help one thing, then you got to do something different. No, that's not saying I am really against medication. I don't take anything. The blood pressure was was forced it to move on my daughter because I went to get an operation on my hand and they almost stopped it because my blood pressure was too high. And she got on my yeah on my eyes. It was two hundred something back then. Yeah. Oh. I get it. I get it. But let's let's have a sit down and talk about it, man. Yeah, you want to do Thursday after lunch, um, or is Friday morning the best? What time on Friday? No, I think I have an appointment on Friday. Thursday, what time? Um, some time between one and three would be best for me. Okay. Let's do that. You just want to meet there at the Winston office. Well, we find a few there. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I've got to go to Greensboro that morning and then I'll come back and meet you at the Winston office. What time? Um, one thirty. One thirty fine. Yes. Okay. All right. I'll see you then. Thursday one, one thirty. All right. Okay. Thanks. Bye. Bye.
