Sorry for your hold. This is Cody to help you. Hey Cody, this is Dallas. Hey Dallas, I'm good. How are you? Pretty good man. No bad news on my end. That's good. Yeah, yeah. So just a just a quick question. If you are able to do that today, are you able to do a certificate holder for steel buildings and structures? Um, yes, didn't they get the one that I sent them or not? Ah, so they didn't receive it on there for some reason. And last time I came to, I think you had something to deal with your family or something that day. So I went with another guy that was there, and I got it on paper. But I guess on there and they just lost it. Okay. Um. Give me just a second here. Let me see. I'm just trying to see if I can find the one where I sent it to them and I'll just forward it. Yeah, I sent it to Brenda over it. Yeah. And I CC'd you on that too, so you should have that copy in your email if you ever needed to send that to them again. But um, I will forward this. Yeah, here's the one I sent to Brenda at Steel Buildings. Um, I will. Forward this over to them and CC you on that just so you. Well do do do you do you care if you do it like on a paper copy? Um, I'm already on my way over here to your lines. Oh yeah. Print one out for you. That's no problem. Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah, I'll just go pick it up and. That way, I guess less hassle for me and them later in the future. I guess. Yeah, yeah, that's no problem. I will. Yeah, if you ever needed to though, if you search your emails just for like my email address, you should see that copy that I sent to Brenda and I CC'd you on just in case you ever needed one in the future and you wanted to print it out or whatever, email it again or whatever. But yeah, I'll print one out for you and you can come by and scoop it up. I'll be just fine. All right, cool. Yeah, I'm on my way. Okay, buddy. All right, thank you so much, sir. Bye.
