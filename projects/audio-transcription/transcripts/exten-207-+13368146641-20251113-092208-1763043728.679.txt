Sorry for your call. This is Cody. May help you. Oh yes, Cody. My name is Delphina Lewis. You sent me email on probably Monday. About my policy renewal. I'm sorry. What was your name? Other person here. Delphina Lewis. I sent you an email. This. I got it on my email. Mister six four four four at gmail dot com. Was it Corbin or Cody? No, it said Cody. Let me look on my email. Yes, see. I can pull it back up for me. It said Cody. C O D Y. Is you have someone by that name? That's my name. Yeah, I'm just trying to. Well, you deal with a lot of people, so you probably just forgot. You know. Because I talked to a lady last week in reference to. I called something about my policy. Yes, man. And then I talked with her, and she said it wasn't due ready yet. That was that might have been two weeks ago. And then I took on my email and I seen this at Cody. You know about a renewal. Oh, I think it was an email that the agency just sent out on my behalf. Is what it was. That's why we started confused. I'm sorry about that. I have talked to you before. Yeah, man. Yeah, I remember you. I was just like, well, I didn't send an email Monday to you, so I was just trying to. But it's probably the agency sometimes sends out emails on our behalf about you know renewals and things going on and stuff like that. So that's probably just what that was. Okay. But I'm trying to see what's what and I'm hoping I know things are going up. That it wouldn't be going up that much or unless y'all have y'all work with other agencies, don't you? With other insurance companies. Yes. Yes, man. Yeah, we represent several different companies. Uh huh. And see what we, you know, with my auto and my home. Yep. So the renewals come up. Let's see. So the homeowner's renews on January the thirteenth. So we're about two months out on that one. And the auto renews February the fifth. So we're almost three months out on that one. I don't have the new stuff yet. I can go check the website real quick. It's usually a little bit early when you're 60 to 90 days out. Usually it's closer to 30 to 45. It just depends on the company. But give me just a second and I'll go in here and look. Well, I just thought since I've had that email, I just thought. What did the email say exactly? Something about checking in with your about your renewal. Okay. Yeah, it's probably just because your renewal is coming up in you know the first renewal is coming up in 60 days. So that's probably what triggered that email. Okay. Well, I'll wait then. You know just. I mean, I'm just going to check real quick just to see if anything's available yet. So the homeowner's is the one that's on January 13th and that one's not available yet. So I'm sure the the auto probably isn't yet because it's closer to. 75 or 80 days out. Yep, it's not they're not quite available yet. That we the agency sends out those emails just to kind of let people know hey your renewal's coming up. You know, reach out to us, let us know if anything's changed. If we need to do anything different for you, that sort of stuff. So it's just like a reminder email that we send out just to our customers. Know it's coming up, you know, relatively soon and you know just to contact us and. Let us know if there's any been any changes or anything that needs to be addressed. That sort of stuff. Okay. All right. But yeah, if once you you'll get a policy packet renewal packet in the mail, and then once you receive that, if you have any questions or anything about the renewal, feel free to reach out to us. And we can try to help you any way that we can. Okay. All right. Thank you. Yes, man. Have a great day. You too. Bye bye.
