Good afternoon, this is Aaron. Hey Aaron, it's Gary at Alliance Insurance. Yeah, were were you able to get your claim filed? I was. Yep. Okay, I just had a there was a message hanging out here that came out this morning. I just wanted to make sure somebody had been in touch with you. I got you. Yeah, from Alliance, no, no one was in touch with me. But I went so what it was last night I was pulling out of parking lot, hit a pothole hard and it blew my tire out. Okay. And so so I filled I went to the auto owners, app, hit claims, and then it kind of routed me through and I ended up on Alliance's page anyway. Long and short, I I did not get it taken care of last night because I just wasn't in the position that I wanted to deal with it so I filled it out this morning. They've come, they picked up the or they put a spare tire on my car for me and then I drove it to the dealership to have them replace the tire. Good deal, good deal. Well, if you run any issues, you just call us back, okay. Okay, I appreciate it. Yes, sir. Well, I've got you, Gary. Do you might pass you a quick question. Sure. This is this is about my other policies. I noticed this year that my homeowners insurance jumped up like twelve hundred bucks. It went up that much. Wow. It went up a lot. Yeah, it went up a lot. And I understand that across the state rates have been increasing, but I thought that was a pretty sizable increase and I was not expecting such a big jump. Do you all mind just running some quotes or some? See what else may be out there. I like auto owners, but that just seemed like a really big jump to me. We've seen a lot of theirs jump up, but we need to check and see what kind of changes they made to the policy because I know a lot of the the replacement valuations and all that have been upgraded from last year. Yeah, that went way up too. It's like eight hundred and eighty thousand or something like that. My house is worth seven hundred. So. Okay. Maybe that's what it was too that drove it up like that. But well, I will personally take a look at it and see if if nothing else, maybe we can go through the replacement valuation and get that corrected. Where we can get you back down a little bit. The only thing about trying to move the home without the auto is you lose those discounts and with auto owners it is a pretty good discount. So if we move the homeowners to somebody else, then you are probably going to see your auto increase. Yeah, and I probably look to move both of them at the same time. So if there is a place that is doing better for both. Well and well just to throw another tink into everything here. I know that insurance too. Yeah yeah yeah well that's going that's going to be fine but with the package that you've got with the umbrella and the life insurance and all that. Whenever you start splitting those apart, then there are some advantages to having them all together. Now one one disadvantage. All of your policies renew at the same time. Now you we can cancel a homeowner's policy in mid term and move it without penalty. If you do that on the auto, then they're going to send you another bill once that's canceled. So so we want to make sure that if if we move at number one that we're able to save you enough to offset any of those short rate charges and losses of discounts and all that. Yeah, if you if you can't if you can't save enough money by moving it to do that, then I would at least try to hold on until it renews again next year or this year. Yeah, but would that be like November December or would I be able to do it like? You are set on a you are set on an annual you are set on an annual policy, so the actual policies don't renew until December again. But that being said, the farther we go into the term, the less the penalty will be because they figure that penalty on the number of months that are left on the policy. But I will I will get on this for you Monday and and see if I can figure out some things. Has anyone talked to you about having a look to see what kind of deductibles or anything you have on there? They haven't, but I've kind of kept the deductibles where they've been. But if you want to take a look at that too, feel free. Well, it's it's not like it is on the auto on the homeowner side. If you are at a thousand dollar deductible and move it up to say twenty five hundred, then you are going to see a pretty substantial savings on the rate.
