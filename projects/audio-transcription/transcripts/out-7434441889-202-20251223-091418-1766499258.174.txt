Hello. Hey, Kelsey, this is Heather with the insurance. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Doing good. I wanted to let you know that I got a second year of experience added to your policy, so it did remove some premium. And then your next amount due is three hundred and ten dollars and thirty four cent, which is due on the twenty ninth. But that should be helpful going forward with that experience on there. Okay, and I'm going to remove one of the vehicles. Okay, you'll just need to. Yeah, you'll just need to make sure the license plate is returned. Yeah, and then give us a call. Okay, I'll turn it later today. And then I'll give you a call. All right, that sounds good, and you can you can let anybody know. It doesn't necessarily have to be me, just in case I'm on the phone or something. So just let them know that you're needing to remove a vehicle. But as of right now, this has went down. I think you were paying four seventy six and went down to three ten. And then once you remove the vehicle, it'll adjust again. Okay. Okay, well I pay. Will I still be paying for this vehicle this month or no? The one I'm taking off. They adjust. Yeah, they'll let you know once we remove the vehicle what you're looking at as far as payment for this month. Okay, and that vehicle has been told to the insurance, but I don't know if I'm going to get it back or they haven't contacted me about that. Okay, yeah, that might be something as well. But make sure the tag turned in just so the DMV or the Department of Transportation doesn't find me. For having an active tag, okay. Okay, and then I'll try to see where's my car at. Yeah, that too. All right, thank you. Thank you. But.
