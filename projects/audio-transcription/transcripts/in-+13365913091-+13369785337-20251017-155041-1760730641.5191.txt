Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Yes, ma'am. I'm looking at Angela Lowe. I I have been trying for over a week to get on the the portal to pay our insurance and I don't know I used to go in on the quick pay thing. Do you know did they did they do away with that? Which Angela, which policy are you trying to pay? The auto. The auto. Okay, let me pull it up here. Let me see if I can pull it up. I can't even get on our. I've got the app on my phone. I can't even get on that. It keeps telling me the password is incorrect and when I try to reset the password, I send it to my email and it. I never get it. I know what's going on. Well, um, so is the address six nine zero zero? Is it Terrence Noel? Yes, ma'am. Okay. The email address that's been showing. Um, is your last name seven four seven five at yahoo dot com? Is that? Yes, ma'am. That is yes, that's correct. Okay, so I've got it pulled up here. Now ours, when I log in, we go through an agency portal. So it's not. Um. It's not the exact one that you do, but sometimes their website is down and it'll tell us it's down. So um, so that's not the case because I can get in. Um. If you want Angela, now if you need to make a payment or anything like that, I can definitely help you out because I'm in your policy. Um. Okay, well just go ahead then since I'm on the phone with you. Just go ahead and and do it because like like I said I've been trying and my dad my dad's been sick and so I forgot about it and I said oh lord I said I need to call and. Yeah, yeah, I'll definitely help you out with that. Um, so it's showing the payment amount is is three hundred and eighty three dollars and forty five cents. Okay. Yes. And when you do that, I need to ask you another question. Um, to see if you can look at that, but go ahead and do the the payment and then I'll ask that. Okay, sure. Um, it does show there's a card on file that ends in two zero nine nine. Yes, yes, that's my debit card. So you can go ahead. Okay, Angela. So I got that payment applied, and I was going to tell you too. Um. If you if you still continue to have a problem with it, I can I can definitely give you um National General's phone number. Um, they can probably help you like reset your information. Okay, yeah, my husband and I both work for National General. I'm out on medical leave right now, but um, yeah, we can call them and and see um. What the deal is because I I don't know. I mean I even went in the spam to see if it was if it was maybe in sending it there and it's it's not so I I don't know what's going on. Yeah, I don't either because it's got the right. You know you confirm that it was the right email. Mhm. Yeah. Okay. For sure. All right. My next question is all right. My son Brandon he was he had went to cookout there in Los Angeles and he was pulling around um. The cookout and this lady and man in this 1996 and they saw Maxima was stopped in the travel lane and he couldn't avoid it because he couldn't see him and he hit him in the back. Well, they did the claim and every I know they did the claim and everything and um. Of course they were complete. I mean he barely hit him, but he's got a big truck. So they were they were perfectly fine there. You know how that goes and then of course now you know they did an injury claim. Can you tell me because I've been asking my husband to call the injury adjuster and he keeps forgetting. Can you tell on there how much? I know they were the man they settled with him for like two hundred and fifty dollars. Does it say well how much they settled with the woman? Um, Angela, I tell you what. Let me let me see if I can get you over to an agent and then they can help you out with that question. Okay. Okay. Hold on just a moment. Um, I'm going to transfer you over. You have a good weekend. Okay. You too.
