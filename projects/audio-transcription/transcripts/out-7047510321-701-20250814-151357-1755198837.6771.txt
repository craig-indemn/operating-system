Hi, this is Arlene. Hey there, Arlene. This is Jeremy at Alliance. Hey. How are you? Fine. Everything going your way, okay? It is. It is. We are doing as well here. We just got a little bit of rain that started happening outside right now. We just got our first sun. Oh really. It's nice to see it dry up a little bit. Yes. Yes, absolutely, absolutely. It started out sudden and just slowly clouded over and now it's just kind of a steady little shower. I'm about done with it. Hey, you've been working hard for me. Yes, I have. I've got you some information. Based on your answer, will determine the outcome. How's that? Okay. Sounds good. All right. So the first way I went about this was I looked at okay one company. Home and auto. What's that going to be? So the the company I looked at was they're called Auto Owners. All right. The homeowners. Is that the homeowners? Wait a minute, where am I at? I've got both of them open and now I don't know which one I'm looking. Okay, so the homeowners. If paid in full, is 1680. All right. If you if you put it on a payment plan, it's 2024. So this is one of those that's got a big swing of of doing it that way, okay. Now that's giving credit for writing the auto with this same company. All right. The auto for the other company monthly is right at 200 dollars a month. Or if it's paid in full would be 2155 and that's for an entire year. Uh huh. Okay. Now the other way is if I just write the auto with this company because they will take a home only. It then changes. That price to. I just got to click a button and then go to the next page again. Sorry about the delay here. Writing the home only in this case. The paid in full price is 1907. The price on a monthly payment plan for a year is 2297. All right. Then I have a different company to write the auto with who's giving you a little bit of credit on the home side but you're getting credit for writing a home with us on the auto side a little bit better. And that monthly payment scheme would be 153 a month. On that one. If that one was paid in full for the year, it would be. See. I'm going to tell you how big a savings difference it is on this one. It's not a big savings difference on the auto in this case. It'd be 1686 which would basically bring it down to. That saves about 100 and some dollars for the year. That one doesn't have a big savings on the auto. Uh huh. So those are the best options I have started with so far. And now I go back to you for feedback and see what your thoughts are. Okay, what are the company names? All right. So the company name for the home in both cases is Auto Owners. All right, they are out of Michigan. They've been around a long time. They're kind of a a company that writes kind of this side of the states, if you will, kind of from Michigan down over into our area. And so on down to the southeast. Um. The policy for the home, the pricing on both of those. Include the the coverages that I'm getting ready to go over with you as well. And those covers being the home would be insured. For a guaranteed replacement cost policy is what this is. It's the HE7. So 388 200 is what we have. The dwelling is being. What's the word? Of being total loss rebuild. That would still be insured to rebuild no matter what. It includes the 2,500 deductible. I increased the coverage. For the extra barn on the property, for an extra 60,000 that's included in this price. Your contents would be 271,740. Again, please. 271,740. For your contents. It also has included in this price equipment breakdown coverage up to 100,000. What's up to? What's up to 100,000 dollars. Equipment breakdown coverage. Explain please. The the example I like to use is this you've got a HVAC unit system that maybe gets struck by lightning. Something like that. Uh, malfunction to something that is. Maybe it would be warranty covered, but it's not now because the warranty's gone. It's basically just not from. Common wear and tear type things, but it covers it to where if it had to Oh, I thought. I thought, "Oh, okay, I got you. Okay, and then you got the the yearly amount if you or the yeah monthly amount, and then you've got auto and home for that 153. That's with National General or is that with Auto?" All right, the homeowners, the home, the home stays with Auto owners in both of those scenarios, whether it's by itself with writing with National General on the auto. Or if you write both with Auto owners, so the when I told you that the full price that if you paid up front went from 1680 to 1907, that's when we write the auto with National General, which was the one will nots 146. Now a month on yet. I didn't follow you with anything. You said that both the only company that we're talking about for the house is Auto owners. Yes, that is correct. Okay, okay, good. Why would we change to National General? Because Drumroll, the the price. I I literally wasn't spending out of your wallet. I see that okay if the takeaway was if you were dissuaded by the auto price with Auto owners being close to 200 dollars a month. Uh huh. And you wanted to be lower, like a 150. Then the best way I could offer that to you on the auto side was to split those up and then tell you how it would impact the homeowners with Auto owners. Doing it that way, I was trying to give you some options on pricing. So it raised it raised the homeowners then a couple hundred dollars or 127 dollars or something. A hunk of money. Yes, a hunk of money. That's exactly right. About 230 dollars actually. Uh huh. Yeah. It's uh okay. Um. Isn't the thing to I'm still kind of confused. But isn't the thing to do is just go ahead and go with the home or Auto owners for both of them. Yes, and it is it is in my opinion absolutely. Just sit back and relax and pay that monthly and if we have any problems look look them up. Yep, that's it. Okay, then um, yeah, I appreciate that Jeremy and for you being able to you know see if you can get that price down but price ain't necessarily everything. But then, but then how much more we actually we actually be paying for the auto or something? Two hundred a month. That's fifty dollars a month. See right now your auto is showing to be for the next six months is renewing at 895. If it did not go up at all, the next six months which would be highly unlikely, but I'll be conservative here. See 895 times two means you would be paying 1790 a year. Okay. The difference of doing this with Auto owners is that it would be 21. Oh no, excuse me. We're doing the monthly, so it would be 2393. So that's technically 600 more on the auto side. That's a lot of money. That is when you look at it that way. Yes, ma'am, and that's why I broke it down further to say okay. So if I can keep her in that point, that price point of okay, we keep it closer to. What she's paying currently on the auto side, how negatively does it impact it? What looks like it offsets it to where it's about 230 dollars more. To write the home with Auto owners and write the and when I said 230 dollars more, I'm going with that full pay price. Obviously, if you break okay, okay, full full on both full price on both of them. On the auto and home paying yearly. Okay, so auto and home paying yearly with Auto owners. You want to know what those numbers are? Yeah, yeah, let's do that. Okay, so on Auto owners would be that 1680 paid in full writing with Auto owners. The auto. Make sure I've got this other pot. I want to make sure I've got the right credit being checked for you. What is that? That is not what I wanted. Yes, okay. So full price on the automobiles with Auto owners is 21. 55. Point three two. Uh huh. Okay, I'm adding those together. Three thousand eight hundred thirty-five dollars and thirty-two cents. Okay. Then can we can we add the house house and the National General together, please? Yeah, we can. So on the home, if we are not doing the auto with the same company, it's 1907. Uh huh. And then. Go up here. I put paying full from checking. I just picked that one because that's the better. As the Yeah, because that'll give you an idea to save back. If you budget out over the next year's time, three hundred and twenty dollars a month roughly, that kind of gets you close enough to where you can do this again without a lot of skin off your back if if that makes sense. Yeah, hey Jeremy. We're going to use cards in order to get the money for our closing costs. Can I just take and give you a card to put this on, so that I don't have some cash and then turn around. Yeah. So then I need a card for about that total. Set. Okay, because it's all going to one company. They could I give it give you two cards for that. I could pay one card. I could pay one policy with one card and another policy with the other card. Okay, let me work on that then. Okay. Sure. And I don't have to wait in. I don't think, or just I'll have it ready to where. As soon as we get our money for the close closing, then I'll know that we've not used these cards and I can give it to you right away. So that'll be fine. Here's what I'm going to do for you right now. I'm getting ready to send you a text again from my cell phone. You still you still have it right where I said I just got the info you said you had sent me. I just got in. Tell me what I'm supposed to do again. I'll just put this is Jeremy from Alliance again to you so it'll go to the top of your messages. Okay. And then that way when you're ready for me to call you, send me a text and say hey can you call me in the next so many so much time and I'll call and get the card info from you. Okay, we got it, don't we? Yes, man. We are set up. It sounds like okay that was pretty effortless on my part. I know it's a lot more work on yours, so I appreciate it. Oh, absolutely, it's my pleasure. That's what I'm here for. Okay, so where do you live in connection with the mountain? The property I live on from my wife's family's property. We lived there. It literally touches Pilot Mountain on the back side. It literally does what Pilot Mountain on the back side. The back side of Pilot Mountain, our property line touches the state park. Does it really? It does. Yes. That's that's really cool. That's really cool. Now you say the back side. Well, would that be the north side you're talking about? More so, it's actually the side that was burning. Yeah, whatever happened. What was the story with it? Well, the last time it happened, my brother-in-law and I actually were in the woods hunting, and he seen a fire start. And he was one of the first ones that called it in. It was somebody who didn't put out a campfire right. And it just started as a poor, you know, somebody not paying attention. Man, yeah, the first time it happened a lot of years ago, like ten or twelve years ago. Was I think it was arson. I think somebody had been a little goofy. I thought it would be kind of funny. It wasn't. Yeah, because it was it was one of those things that was really cool to see unless you lived that close. Yeah, that's that cool to see. Yeah, I agree. We we saw a mountain fire up off the parkway. Yeah, that was that was wild. Yes, that was wild. We we we called it in, but they said that they had been fighting it all day already. Yeah, and so how did you guys have damage? Oh no, no. Thankfully, we we did not have any issues whatsoever because I live where I lived where I was working here in town. I would go home periodically and just check. Oh, I think I would stay at home with the garden hose. I'm going to tell you by the time that got down to the house that garden hose wasn't going to do me any good. I'd be better to drink it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That reminds me something. Listen, as far as the mountains concerned or the park, hubby and I do battery powered trikes because he's a paraplegic. Is there a place for us to ride there? Not safely, no. Okay, thank you. Yeah, no, yeah, you're welcome. It's really more of we you go up and it's a very tight and winding steep incline to get up to the top of the mountain and then it's just basically a big parking lot and you go down. Trails that are very let's see roots stone you know it's very uneven surfaces. Very well, what about unless you're just out there on
