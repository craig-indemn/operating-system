Hello, this is Heather. Hello, Heather, this is Don Hensar. Hey Don, how's it going? I want to check in with you. Oh, pretty good. Actually, I was just on the phone with AutoOwners, trying to get you approved. Yeah, the so they did they just I just actually hung up with Jenny, the underwriter with AutoOwners, but and she approved it. So we've been working on it. It's due to the claim. So there's two claims, and I know you said it was due to Hurricane last year. That caused damage. Right. Yeah, so and all have been everything has been repaired. The claim is closed, right? Because it looks like it's still open. No, it was closed last year. At this time. Yeah, that's what I thought you told me. So I told the underwriter that that all the repairs have been made. Assume that the claim has been closed, but there was. Yeah, I don't know why that would must be showing up in your database is open. It does. It looks like it you know each carrier when we run the reports with each one it populates like a report a loss history report. So let me go in to AutoOwners because I was just in there. Because it was looking like Cincinnati, you probably better off just stay there for now. But I did get approval. With are you familiar with AutoOwners? No, I never heard of it. No. So there are top carriers, AutoOwners in Cincinnati are our two top carriers, which I know that's who you have currently. Where I never heard of Cincinnati before. My my agent told me about it, so I'm not at that well versed in you know insurance. So what the report has done, it's got a loss date of 8824. And it's separated so it's like 32, 952 dollars on one. And then there's another one same date that was 57, 185. Right. So I thought it was about 70. Yeah. But being the same date these two, you know she was able to to look at it, but yeah I mean it looks like when we run the reports. Yeah, when we run the reports, it looks like there's two claims that was filed. No. There might have been two payments made out to the contractor. And that's what it probably was. Yeah, it probably was that. But. You probably got a down payment and a final payment. Yeah, I don't know. It just says you know 32, 952 and then 57, 185, which is you know a significant amount. But nobody was going to approve it if it was two claims and it was still open and repairs have not been made. But that's what I said. I went to yeah I went to had to contact underwriting to get you approved. So yes, I am working on that one and I'll be sending that over to you shortly. That's that's about the only one we would go to. I wouldn't. Well, everybody else denied it. I mean, I'd have to call some of the others, but like I said, AutoOwners is our top carrier in Cincinnati. So. You could look at splitting it up. You could look at splitting the home and auto up, but I I just I wouldn't do that. Like I said, you currently have a good carrier. You've got both your home auto and umbrella right with Cincinnati. All three policies are with them. Yeah, but they dropped the umbrella. Oh, that's right. That's right. Okay. Yep, that's right. I forgot you did say that. So yeah, so I'm trying to quote that too. But that's what we're looking at, AutoOwners. So I'll like I said I'll have those finalized up here shortly, and I'll get them emailed to you. Okay. I'm glad you called because like I said I've been working on it and. Yeah, I really appreciate your work as hard. You said you were going to get back to me Monday, so it's just. Yeah, it's it's been more complex than what I thought, but. Anyway, well you know we're trying to get it done for you, but yeah. Okay. I just hung the phone up with AutoOwners, and she she approved it finally. So. That's where we are. Okay, I'm going to finalize both all three of the policies. I'm going to make sure I'm going to run the reports on everything, just to make sure you know we're good on all three. Okay. Okay. Well, I appreciate your your work there. Sounds like it was a little more. Like it was a little more complex than what I thought we were looking at, but that was
