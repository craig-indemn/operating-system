Hello, this Jeff. Jeff's Joe. Hey buddy. Yo man. Hey, uh, sorry to bother you. Did we ever finalize ABV's the the new altered beast venture? Did they set up on bank draft or just say they were going to? They said they were going to. He I looked in his docs yesterday and he was sent an invoice. That he can basically you know if he wants us to do it do it for him we can. I think I put that. I got the invoice. Yeah, invoice is in the op. It's in the op. I thought I put it in the op. Check the op and I think if he wants us to help him set that up on draft, we can do that or he can do it himself. Okay. But we did not go any further than shoot. Uh, what's his name? Not Brian, but the Riley said there wasn't anything else for us to do and it was issued and sure enough it's issued the docs are in there the invoice has been sent out. So he should have gotten that. Maybe verify if he needs our help in setting that up. Yeah come on back. Yeah, they just they just now walked in. Ah okay. Well I'm here. Let me know if we need to do anything. Hey we'll do. Thank you so much. Alright man, see you. Bye. I see.
