Thank you for calling NC Carports and Garages. This call is being recorded. Please hold for the next available agent. Good afternoon, this is Karina with NC Carports. I can help you. Hey, good afternoon, Jeff Edmonds with Alliance Insurance. Is Vicky available, please? All right, Mister Edmonds. Did you say this was for life insurance? No, I'm with Alliance Insurance. She sent me an email earlier this afternoon, and I'm just now getting back to her. I just need to speak with her a minute. All right, Mister Jeff. So unfortunately, Miss Vicky did leave for the day, sir. If you don't mind, I can leave her a message for her to give you a call back at this number, saying that you did try reaching out to her. That'll be fine, and I can also call her back on Monday as well. I'm not sure how urgent what she needed is, so that'll be fine. All right, Mister Jeff. I do hope you have a great rest of your day, sir. You too. Thank you. Bye bye.
