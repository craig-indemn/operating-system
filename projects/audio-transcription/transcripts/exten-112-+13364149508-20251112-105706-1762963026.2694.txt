Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Brandi, this is Earl Williams. I'm sorry to keep bothering you. I just wanted to double check to see if you got the roofing information. Oh, that we talked about the other day. Yeah, so I actually reached out to the. The. Company I one percent roofing yeah. Well, it turns out I didn't have to reach out to them because in national I reached out to the underwriter there to see what the roof date we currently had on there and it is 2025. So your home insurance is up to date. Oh okay. With the correct roof date, so you are. Oh okay, okay. Well, I wasn't sure. I even called after I talked with you. I said, "Well, I called them and talked to the owner of the company and he said he would send you a copy, but I I was just kind of checking to see if he had actually sent a copy." Well, I hadn't seen anything yet come through, but I was we were out yesterday because we closed her insurance day and I had a note here for me to give you a call and let you know that we don't need it. Okay. But I mean. Well, you want the call now. Well, if if he wants to send me a copy, that that will still be good. We can still keep it into the system just in case we move you from to a different company in the next five years. Because we may need that later on down the road, but we don't need it now to to. Okay. To update the call. Well, he said, "Well, like I say, he told me I told him send it to Alliance and attention Brandi." Okay. So, so he I'm hoping he'll send you one. He said told me he would. Okay. Well, I'll keep an eye out on it and I'll let you know if I do get it. All right. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Have a good day. Bye bye. You too.
