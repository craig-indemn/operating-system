Hello. Hi there. Is this Cliff, or is this Sarah? Cliff. It's Dina with Alliance Insurance. I was trying to call Sarah, but I guess I have the wrong phone number under the wrong person here. Um, it looks like she called the office, so I'm returning her call back. Is I think she's trying to make a payment. Um, yeah, that that's okay. Let me. She's right in the next room. Hang on just a second. Okay. Thank you. Hello. This is Sarah. Hey Sarah, it's Dina with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Hey Dina, I'm doing good. How are you doing? I'm doing good, doing good. Um, I had left you a message earlier, and then when I got to looking in the voicemails and stuff, I saw that you had called. Um, that you had called in and. Yeah. Are you wanting to go ahead and make that payment? Um yes, um and and also I I wanted to just double check and get some clarity on. Um. Just make sure we weren't going to have a lapse in our coverage. Um, I don't, Brandy kind of assured me that we wouldn't, but it's been it's been we've been back and forth so much and so I just want to make sure everything is. Good. Can you see that on your end? For the travelers, for the when you make your travelers payment, it's not canceled yet. Um. So yeah, there won't be a lapse as long as you get a payment in before the cancellation date. Well, so we you might not see this, but we moved the truck from Progressive to Travelers. Um. And so I don't we are not active with Progressive right now, and I'm not sure if we're even active with Travelers because. Um. This was the like the very first payment. To initiate the policy for the truck with Travelers. Yeah, um, yeah, that's why that's why I'm trying. I've got the policy pulled up here. Okay. Awesome. Yeah, so I mean you might. Um, when you switch companies like that, sometimes the DMV is kind of slow on things. Um. So you might get a letter from the DMV, but you do just give us a call and we can get that. Um. Updated if you do you might not get one. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah. So it looks like it's on P M four right now for 604 dollars and 47 cents. I was wondering, and that's for the is that that's just for the truck. Yes. Okay. Um. I was wondering and um, so I talked to Brandy about maybe setting this up as a monthly instead of all at once. Or we could even do quarterly, or you know whatever is going to work best to our. You know. Benefit or whatever they would agree to. Okay. Can you set it up on AutoPay with a routing and account number or with a credit card? I can do that. Okay, all right, very good. Which one do you want to do? Um. Do checking account and routing number. Okay. All right. I'm getting it. Go ahead. I'm getting it pulled up. Okay. Sorry. Um. Just need to get it pulled up here. Okay. Sorry about that. Um. Do you want the account number or routing number first? Um. Eight one. Okay. Um. Account number is one zero zero zero. Five three four three three six three. Okay, so I've got one zero zero zero five three four three six three. Uh three three six three. Three three. Oh. Okay. Let me read it back to you one more time. Let me make sure. Okay. So I've got one thousand five three four three three six three. Exactly. Okay. All right. So go ahead with the routing number. That is two five three one seven seven eight eight seven. Okay, two five three one seven seven eight eight seven. Right. Okay. All right. I don't know what the down payment amount will be. It might be two installments. I'm not really for sure, but I have the the routing and account numbers. So are you good for me to because I'm going to call them. Okay. And um, are you good for me to go ahead and make the payment whatever they say the amount is and then um and then I can set it up on the installments for you. That would be great. Okay. All right, very good. All right, Sarah. We'll get this in for you. Okay. Okay. Thank you, Dina. You're welcome. You take care. You too. Bye bye. Bye bye.
