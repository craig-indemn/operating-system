Thank you for holding me together. Hello. Oh hello, I thought that was your insurance speak. I'm sorry. This is Yolanda. This is Yolanda London. And we received another email from the Department of Transportation. I don't know if you remember about the liability. Yeah. From yeah, JC has admitted that. And it's saying now that we owe fifty five dollars. No, you don't. Yolanda, can you resend that? Do you have the form? Can you take a picture of it and email it to our support email. Send it to your support. It's going to be support. Instead of mine, mine is Heather F. Just send that to support at myallianceinsurance dot com. Support at myalliance. Alliance insurance. Insurance by the way out. Dot com. Yes, get that. If you send over, um, a lot of times sometimes these are like um, just a cross over in the mail, but um sometimes it takes two or three times to do it for some reason. I don't know. DMV is so far behind. Um. And it is for the nineteen ninety nine dollars. Yeah, with the license plate LJJ forty four forty six. Yeah, we don't have the license plate. We just go on. Oh, it's just the VIN number that we insure. Okay, but yes, it's in ninety five nineteen. Okay. Yeah. Um. Yeah, send that over to support Yolanda. Don't pay it. When you get that, send over give us like a week and then if you want to call me back, I can check on it. But yeah, don't pay that. Okay, I'm sure it's just a cross over, but I want to resubmit it anyway. But the JC she's someone that handled it before and Brandy have worked on it too. They're on our support team, so they'll be able to get it right away. Okay. Okay. Thank you. I hate that. Yes, well Yolanda, and like I said, just if you want to check that with me in about a week, and I can go in and check it again for you. Okay. Okay. All right. Otherwise, y'all doing okay? Everything going good? Good. Yeah. Okay. First two days of school. That's all. They had it. Oh gosh. Oh yes, yeah. Yeah, I miss those days. Enjoy them. I know it's hectic and crazy, but it is. In one day, I'll be like, "Golly, I wish I could do it again." Oh no, I'm a teacher not not because my kids are first two days of school. Oh gosh. Oh yeah, I'm a teacher. No, no, no. Boy, your part.
