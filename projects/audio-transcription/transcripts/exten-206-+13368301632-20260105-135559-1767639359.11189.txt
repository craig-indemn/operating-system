Hello, this Jeff Edmonds. Can I help you? Hey Jeff, I was calling because Oscar went into the office on Friday to see if if the FS1 could be sent over. And he went to the DMV and he says that they told him that they haven't received that exactly. Well, let me go into the account because it was actually processed. I got an email this morning showing where it was processed electronically. Okay. Let me pull the email and I can give you a little bit more information. Hang on one. Okay. Yeah, actually, I sent an email to Oscar this morning. Okay, you did. Yep, with the electronic copy showing where the FS1 for the 2025 Ford. Uh, was processed with an effective date of November the third, which I which is what he said he needed. So that should have been done and the DMV should be able to pull that. Okay, let me go ahead and call him and tell him to go there. Thank you. Yep, you're welcome. Bye bye. Bye bye.
