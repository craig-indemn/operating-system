Hello. Hey Dewey, it's Bina with Alliance Insurance. So I just got off the phone with Travelers, and so technically you don't have anything due until September the tenth. It shows that payment of B due for one fifty seven and seventy five cents, because the last payment that you paid that for eighty twenty five that cost you up for your August installment. I mean if you just want to pay, you know you can always just pay if you want and that would just go towards your September installment, but it's up to you. You don't have anything due. I wait until September tenth, and on September tenth, that payment will be one hundred and fifty seven dollars as well. Yeah, that's what it's showing right now. It's one fifty seven and seventy five cents. I don't know if there'll be a three dollar service fee if that includes that or if that will be added. I'm not really for sure. The bill hasn't generated yet. Okay. Okay. Very good. You're welcome. You take care. Okay. All right, I will do the same. Thank you. Bye bye.
