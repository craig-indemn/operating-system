Hello. Good morning, Evelyn. Hello. Hi there, Evelyn. Good morning. This is Jamie Flippin here with the Lions Insurance. How are you? Hi, how are you? I'm doing well. I hope you are. Evelyn, I had you on my calendar this morning just to do some account review with you to make sure everything is up to date in the system. At a glance, looks like you and Jack have home, auto and umbrella all coming up for renewal in September, late September. So certainly want to make sure all that information is still up to date. I'm going to be very quick with this review. Please stop me, interrupt me if anything needs to change or get updated. I'm going to look at contact information first, make sure that things still work. There, your phone number seems to work just fine. Your email is Evelyn dot frost at gmail dot com. Jack is in the system at three three six eight nine seven six two nine seven and his email is jack dot frost in u g a n d a at gmail dot com. Is that still good contact for both of you? Yes, huh? Deal. My mailing address in our system is eleven oh nine Foxfire Drive in Greensboro, North Carolina two seven four one zero. Okay, so contact is good. I'm going to check this home policy first, just to make sure everything is still up to date there. Active home policy with auto owners insurance that is slated for renewal on September 25th. It does reflect the exact same address at eleven oh nine Foxfire Drive in Greensboro. Um, now I'm not yet within a 30 day window, so I cannot see the upcoming renewal. I'm just looking at current information. Current coverage on the property, Evelyn is. Three hundred forty four thousand dollars even, and there is a one thousand dollar deductible on the actual H E seven form. So keeping this thing completely up to date in the system, just simply ask you, have y'all made any changes or updates to the house in the last year? Anything I should note in the system? No, no changes. Okay, no word is there. You take a peek. Is any mortgage information associated? Let's see. No, we we paid it in full. We don't have mortgage. Congratulations. Wish I could say the same. All right, so home is good. Let me check the auto for you. Yeah, you can't see how much the charge will be this time because it's it's gone up significantly each year. Last time it went up 47 from the year before. Evelyn, I'm going to a simple answer's no. I can't yet see what's coming. Okay. I can tell you. I can tell you if actually at minimum there's going to be two changes on this. Well, one change for sure. I've got my owner's money on the second one. So the state of North Carolina implemented a base rate increase on all property and auto policies again this year. It's going to it's going to go up by at least seven and a half percent from both these policies. The BOI has told us that there will be at least seven and a half percent that's going to come again in 2026. So if all your information stays exactly the same, it's just going to cost more on this upcoming renewal. However, what I think you will likely get what most people have been getting in the guts of your homeowners policy. There is an endorsement called Inflation Guard. That Inflation Guard is there to tell the policy and the carrier to bump coverage every so often just to keep up with natural inflation. But the reality is, last five, well, at least maybe six years really. We have lived through a really high inflation rate just jumped super quickly. Everything's more expensive. So what most people are getting, what I have personally seen, is that the homeowners policy is going to get a bump in coverage. I've seen that coverage bump be as low as say 12. I've seen it be as high as 50, 60. The Inflation Guard doesn't kick in every year. I don't know why. I've seen it more in the last 14, 16 months than I have in recent memory. But if I had to make an educated guess, I would say that the three hundred and what I tell you that three hundred and forty four. Three forty four coverage on the property is is probably going to take. What I would, I'm not letting the freaky out or scare you. So hear me, I say that, but I would say it's probably going to be a decent bump in the coverage. And that alone will affect the money. Most people, unless they've got claims that have just been really large or some type of life change, marriage, divorce, kids on the auto or something. Most people have just been like Is also slated for a September twenty fifth renewal, and on here currently. You've got five hundred five hundred one hundred liability limits on the policy, so great limits. There is a twenty fourteen Toyota Camry scheduled. Coverage on the Camry shows up with comp collision rental and towing. You've got a zero dollar deductible for your comp coverage, a five hundred dollar deductible for your collision coverage. And then looking at drivers driver information just you and Jack, only two drivers are shown there. Yeah, but let me just ask like if if our daughter and son in law are here and our son in law is driving the car, he's a great driver no problems. Is is it covered if he's driving just like if he's doing some local driving? He hasn't done that. I just want. Yeah. Resident relatives would be covered. I would say is it is it a short term thing is it? They're there on vacation staying with you or. Oh no, they're not. I'm just thinking. What if ever we say here Josh drive our car if you know his car's not available or whatever. I just wondered. Yeah, if it if it's a short term thing, I probably wouldn't give too much thought about. Okay. Because because the truth is an auto policy a personal auto policy in North Carolina is very broad coverage. I could let you borrow my truck right now, Evelyn, to go run there and if you crash something, my auto policy would answer the claim. Now what would happen after the claim? Could get sticky, right? Like while let's say your son in law crashed the Camry. And you have to file a claim at that point in time. The carrier is going to ask you, "Why was he driving the car?" And you're going to have to give an educated answer as to why he was driving the car. I've seen it happen where I had a claim one time several years ago, or grandma had moved into the home. And she had never been confessed to the carrier or to us, and so grandma eventually crashed one of the vehicles. They figured out that grandma had been living in the house for like the last year. So carrier paid the claim, but then they added grandma to the policy as a driver and they backdated the premium adjustment. So the client got a bill that the client is not happy about. Yeah. Which. You know that that's really hard to because hey I don't know who's in your house and I'm not going to come knock on your door to look either but but at the same time like you know you. Um, I think it would be covered. What I would suggest would be if it was going to, um, like I've seen it happen where people get older and they move in with family members or family members move in with them. Um and then there's other people driving like back and forth to doctor's appointments and stuff. I would say at that point in time just go ahead and add them on the policy to make sure that that exposure is not there. Yeah. Yeah I'm not expecting this to happen anytime soon they live in another state and we hardly ever see them. I mean we go out there to travel but yeah yeah. Another thing if we rented a car if we rented a car this coverage would cover. The rental. Well, so what you have on here that's a good question. What you have on here is rental reimbursement, okay, and you currently have it. At. I think it was thirty per day. Yeah, so you currently have thirty dollars per day with a nine hundred dollars max. So what this coverage is would be if like let's say something happened, you got in a bump up, I don't know, true them falls on the Camry or something. Now it's in the shop for three weeks. Oh yeah, yeah. This coverage would pay for rental while it's in the shop. Okay. Okay. So there's that. There's also if you went to go rent a car to go on vacation. And now you're in New Mexico driving around and you get an fender bender. Yes, you could come back to this policy and file a claim if you had to. Now what I would suggest the good human in me the good agent would say this Evelyn. It stinks, but buy the coverage through Enterprise or Thrifty or whatever the rental car company is because if you buy through them and you crash their car. It's that policy that's going to eat it, and then and then Evelyn and Jack can come home to North Carolina and be completely clean and free of that accident. Oh yeah, okay, so it is better to buy there. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. And this is this is a rough even me and my wife when we take vacation. Steph never wants to buy the coverage and the agent in me says, "Well, this is a bad decision. We should buy the coverage.
