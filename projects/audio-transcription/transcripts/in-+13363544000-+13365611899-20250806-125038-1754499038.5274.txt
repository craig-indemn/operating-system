Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hello. Can I help you? Hi, Kate. It's my name, Rosa Romero. Okay. How can I help you? Um, I'm her daughter. Okay. So I'll be translating and speaking for my mom. Okay, that's fine. Um, we were wondering if we can add myself to the insurance. Is it under Rosa and Victor? Okay. We'll give me one moment and I'll get an agent that can help you. All right. Thank you so much. You're welcome.
