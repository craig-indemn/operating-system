I just made a couple manual payments on a couple policies and I just need to get the billing accounts combined into one and set it up on EFT, please. All right, and could you please verify the name on this account? It's Thomas Deval, one fifty-six Edwards Drive in downtown North Carolina. Perfect. Thank you. So this one is the workers' compensation. Do you have the other one that you wanted it to be combined with? Yes, it is the same billing account number, but it just ends in seven instead of six. All right. Let me get that one put up here as well. All right, and this is the small business commercial one. I think usually they just move it over the workers' comp over to the package typically. Is that what you want? Do you want them both to be on the one ending in seven? Yeah, that's fine. All right. Do you mind if I place you on a brief hold while I get that for you? No problem.
