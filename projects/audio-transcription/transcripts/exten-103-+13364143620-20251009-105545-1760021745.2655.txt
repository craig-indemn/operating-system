This is Kendall. Hey, it's Joe again. Hey, hey, just got some phone with Cody. He should be sending us a team's invite if you're interested in available. Jump on the call so we can do the share screen stuff. He said there's also he had emailed you a longer version. Of the proposal that has the documents and more information in it the endorsement for exclusion documents. It's about 130 pages long. Okay, let me go back. And I told him I'd get with you to see we can load it in our system because all I had was the one that was 12 pages. He said yeah you're just looking at the quote you need the specimen. It is. Yeah, that one that I attached under here. I think sent it to you. Hey, you did send it to me or you haven't? Or is it in Salesforce? I haven't. It's in Salesforce, but it's in an email. All right, hang on just a second. If I can get to it here. I have to like extend it down to see. Is it in? I guess the carrier submission tab where it's at. Is that where? Or no. No, it's in the case. I can drop it in Teams. No, you don't have to. Hang on just a second. It's in a case. Yeah, I. It's normally it's easier for me to keep up with the emails under the case. So with opportunities I have them both going, but I did just do it in Teams. All right, so hang on because I'm I might be confusing myself. So you have a case inside an opportunity. It's not inside of the opportunity. So if you're on like the main Jupiter profile and go to history. Yeah, yeah. It's there. Okay. So okay, so a case simultaneously with an opportunity. Yes. Right. Okay, that's yeah that's confusing to me. Is that how we need to do it? Because I'm not I'm not real familiar with that. It's easier for me to see it clearly because in opportunities the way that the emails are on the side it's kind of difficult to keep up with. I feel like. Okay, so yeah, I just need to know where the buttons are because this is a little bit of a new dynamic, which is again fine if it's more efficient. So we'll run an opportunity, but carrier track if you're saying you're going to put in a case. Yes, well I do like I update the carrier submissions under the opportunity. So if you know what's been submitted and like just an overview there, but all of the emails I put under the case. Okay, and that's and you're better with that than carrier submission. I think it makes more makes it clear. Okay. Play the emails back and forth. Okay, I'll try to remember that to go find it there. But that's fine just as long as I know what's what's best what we're doing. Okay, now again I don't know if if you're he said it was 130 pages that's not quite 130 but that's all right. You're welcome to jump on this call if you're busy that's fine too. Just wanted to let you know where we were at but yeah we're gonna I'm gonna look at this real quick and. Have that discussion with some of these exclusions and concerns we have. I can I just won't be able to hear unless we're on the phone. Oh, that's right. Never mind. Never mind. Golly, we're having all kinds of problems. No, that's fine. I'll relay everything to you that's important and then or at least through chatter through Salesforce. Okay, we'll just we'll figure out figure out where we are. Sorry for the confusion. No, that's okay. All right. Thanks again. See you. Thanks. Bye.
