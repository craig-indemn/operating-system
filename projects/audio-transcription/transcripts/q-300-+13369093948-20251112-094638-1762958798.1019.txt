Thank you for holding. How can I help you? Yes, I was calling about our homeowner's insurance and I wanted if we could shop it and if we could get it any cheaper. And what's your name? My name is Jane Johnson. The policy is under Brian Rominger. Let me take a look here. Have you spell that last name? R O M I N G E R. I was spelling the first name wrong. That was the problem. Oh yeah, B R Y. Yeah. Let's see. Yeah, do you see? I had a rate increase. Um. Absolutely, I can definitely take a look at this right away. Um, just a few quick questions. Okay. Um, do you know how old the roof is on the home? The roof is only probably about a year old. We had it; it was replaced. Uh, you probably can look on the insurance claim and see when it was replaced. Um. I think it was replaced sometime last year. I don't remember exactly the exact dates, so the roof is only about a year old. Okay, I'll be able to pull that up. Um, do you have any pets? I have a little dog. Okay. Do you know kind of it is? It's mostly Chihuahua. Okay, great. We're not it's the risk too. I'm not sure if it's 100, but. Okay, and what about pools or trampolines? No. Okay, and do you have like um an alarm system that's tied into police and fire or a whole house generator that's automatic? No. Okay, just want to make sure we're not missing any discounts here for you. Okay, and is this the best number to reach you at? The nine zero nine three nine four eight. Yes, ma'am. Okay, perfect. We have multiple carriers, so I'm going to run your information through the carriers and see which one is offering the best rate. Okay, that sounds great. And then I will get right back to you. Um, I just want to check one more thing. Okay, and where do you currently have your auto insurance? Uh, Progressive. Okay, perfect. Pretty sure it's Progressive. Yeah. Okay, we write for them also. So what I'd like to do is. I'll just see if I can cross reference them for package discount as well. Okay, and I don't I give you the. Count number, but I don't have it in front of me. That's okay. They should be able to pull it from the information that I put in the system. Yeah, it's under Brian's name. I'll say. Okay, excellent. Oh, we are starting on this right away, and I will give you a call once I have the information. Okay, and let me tell you, he does have two policies with Progressive. One is commercial, and then one is our personal vehicle. Oh, okay. Oh, let that makes a difference. I'll find out. Okay. All right, I will work on this, and then like I said, I will be in touch as soon as I have the information. Okay, that sounds great. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thank you. Bye bye.
