Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hey, I had a question about a commercial policy. Tried to get hold of somebody on Friday, but I guess y'all got kind of busy. Is there anybody available to chit chat about that report? Yeah, it is it um it's pulling up James. So James, do you have a commercial policy with? Policy with us at the moment. I got four of them. Okay. All right. So hang on just a second. Let me get in here. Yes, for a workers' comp policy. Yeah, that's it. All right. You doing okay today? I can't complain too much. Okay. Good. Okay, so let's see here. Is it on an audit maybe? No, it's for a workers' comp policy. We had I got like I got a letter. So we had a workers' comp. It's a ghost policy, right? So like it doesn't really cover anything. And AmTrust sent me a letter. They're like, "Hey, we did an audit after I canceled my policy, and they're like, we think you should send us another twenty-four hundred dollars just for shits and giggles." And I'm like, Excuse me. Um. So they asked for some documentation, but like I talked to the lady and I was like, "What do you mean?" She's like, "Well, we need a PNL statement," and it's like, "You guys," and I'm not talking you, you guys, but. Yeah. Like AmTrust, like they didn't cover anything. I was like, "What does my PNL have to do with anything?" I was like, "We sub out a lot of stuff." Which a workers' comp policy a ghost policy has no coverage whatsoever. You know what I mean? It's like it's like progressives calling me asking, "Well, hey, how much money you make at your job?" It's like that's irrelevant. Like you're covering my car. Um. So I just wanted to see like what are my steps because like they want an entire PNL. But it's like I don't I don't even know why that was reviewed. Like we canceled that policy, we switched it over, and then they sent in this letter and they said based on the information provided by your insurance agent. So it's like I'm trying. I guess I need to get some some ducks in a row before I figure out what I'm supposed to do with it. Yeah, yeah. I'm not paying them another three grand for for nothing. I found a claim. I had you know there was no issues like it was a ghost policy like I had no employees. And they're like, "Well, you got to tell us that, but you also got to send it. If you have no employees, you got to send a PNL." I'm like, "Why have I sent a PNL? You didn't even cover me. I'm excluded from my own ghost policy." I was like, "You covered nothing." I was like, "I couldn't have I couldn't have filed a claim on it anyway." I was like, "If I was if I was on a job site, I got hurt." I was like, "I couldn't have called you, you know. I was like, you didn't cover anything, so how you call me back and be like, we need another twenty. I think it's like two thousand three hundred and eighty six bucks." Okay. Well, the reason why I asked because there's some notes in here and it looks like Corbin might be working on this. Um, so let me transfer you over to him. And see if he can help you out with that. Okay. Awesome. Now it is right before lunchtime, so I mean I I don't know if he's already left for lunch, but I'm going to transfer you over to to him. So if he doesn't answer, make sure you leave a voice message for him. Okay. Okay, that's okay. I appreciate it. All right, hold on just a moment.
