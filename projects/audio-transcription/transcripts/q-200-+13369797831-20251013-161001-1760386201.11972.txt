Hello, how was uh? Calling because I wanted to get a quote for a truck that I was wanting to purchase. Okay. Um, you're insured or what's already? I am not, no, ma'am. What's your name? My name is Ivan. My last name is Torres. T O R R E S. Okay. No, um, but are you currently insured? No, uh, no, this is like my first, you know, vehicle that I'm buying. Gotcha. Okay. Do you um do you have homeowners insurance or another policy we could look at? No, I have nothing like literally starting from zero nothing. Okay, yeah. So at this time, we don't have a carrier that I could place. I could get a quote for your auto. Most of our carriers they do require you to do like a bundle package. Um, so that you know, looking at home and auto, um, and also since you're um, you don't have previous or prior insurance coverage. Um, but I really don't have a carrier that's going to be competitive at that anyways. So yeah. Okay. At this time, yeah, at this time I just don't don't um have a place where I can put coverage for you at. No, I get you. I understand. All right, but thanks for calling. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
