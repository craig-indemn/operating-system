Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance. I'm Sharon. How can I help you? Ah yes, um, I spoke to Gloria yesterday and she was supposed to send me a certificate of insurance and she never did. Yesterday at the end of the day. So can I get that please because I really need it. So it looks like at the moment she is on another call. I could transfer you over to her voice mail. She'll be giving you a call back as soon as possible. Oh okay, I just okay. All right, give me one.
