This Gary. Hey Gary Shane, every time I tried to answer, it wouldn't let me speak. I know we've got these headphones and I can't get this thing to work correctly, so I'm just on the regular phone here. Okay. The only thing I need to check on Shane is, you know, Ashley, give me some basic information. Uh huh. But I need to know, do you know how long that metal roof's been on there? Probably five or six years. Okay, so you did that yourself. I mean, you had it put on. Yeah, yeah, Piedmont Metal Roofing had put it on. And then what about what kind of heat do you have? You have a heat pump. Heat pump has probably been there five years. Okay, great. And then those other structures on on the property is that is that a wooden carport? Is that what it is? Yeah, I think it's been there probably since the 70s built with telephone poles. Yeah, and you you put the roof on that as well, did you? Yeah, Piedmont did when they done the house. Okay, great. And you have any outbuildings on the property at all? There is two. One of them's a Leonard's aluminum 10 by 12, and one is from that Rhino sheds, which is 8 by 10. You just use it to keep your mowers and stuff in. Yeah, yeah. Okay, are they in pretty good shape? Oh yeah, they're brand spanking. Well, they're probably five six years old. Okay. Now any animals? Do you have any animals on site? Yeah, two cats and a dog. Okay, what kind of dog is it? Great parroties. Okay, so he's not not vicious then. No, got no. And no trampolines. Nope. Hot tubs, swimming pools, nothing like that. Okay, good deal. Good deal. Um, it will probably take me probably by the end of next week. I can call you back and give you some rates on everything. Um. Do you uh does the mortgage company pay it or do you pay it yourself? I do. Okay, so it's Ashcroft. Okay. Yeah, and they have switched over to the AD, not the Mid America sold out now. It's Mister Cooper. Right. Yeah. And um, what about the auto? Who do you have it with? Uh, I've been with State Farm for God knows how many years. Okay, so you you don't have any interest in trying to package everything together. No, sir. Okay, I got you. I got you. Okay, well, give me a few days here and let me get some numbers together and I'll call you back and let you know what we come up with. Okay. Very good. Thanks, man. Uh huh.
