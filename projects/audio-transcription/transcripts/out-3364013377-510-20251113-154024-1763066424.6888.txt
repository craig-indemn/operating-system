Hi. Hey Heather, it's Tracy calling back from Alliance. Hey honey. Hey there. Here is what I have found out. Um, when the policy was issued, it was issued in mid September, and a payment was taken. Okay. He didn't set up the auto draft, so then of course a payment didn't get made in October. So the payment that they process today is for October. Okay. And then she'll have a payment due December third, which will be November. Okay. And then another one on December twenty sixth, and that will be for December. Okay. And then after that, it'll be the twenty sixth of every month. Okay, so she's gonna have between now and December third, nothing should come out, but in December she'll have December third and December twenty sixth. Correct. Okay, all right. That's exactly what I needed to know, honey. I appreciate you so much. I'm sorry to have to drag you into it. Oh no, just ask for me anytime. Don't worry about that. Ask for me. All right. Thank you so much. You're welcome. You have a good evening. You too. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye bye.
