Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Thank you. Hey, my name is Will. I work with Jerry Hunt Super Center here in Lexington. How are you? I'm good. You. Doing well. I have a mutual customer here. She's not sure she didn't drive her car. She's buying a new car, so she doesn't have her insurance card with her. She's buying a new Jeep and she just wants to see if you can pull up her information on the insurance. I have her with me. Okay, what's her name? Cassandra Moore. I have her address, phone number, and all that. Okay, well I found the policy, so give me just one moment and I'll get an agent back and help. Okay, yeah, I just need a proof of full coverage email to me, but they're also going to add the vehicle to the insurance, so yeah, that'll work. Okay, one moment. All right, thanks. You're welcome.
