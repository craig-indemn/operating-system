Yeah, you used to can transfer your tags over from the. I don't know that may have changed. I hadn't do that before. I have no idea if it was an option. I didn't know about that option. The um the which vehicle did you trade? Um, take out the 2020 and then I'm gonna add a 2017 Honda. I mean, take out the 2020 Nissan Maxima, and I'm gonna add a 2017 Honda Accord. Okay. What's that VIN number? H M C R six F is in Frank five seven H C zero one six four six nine. All right. Um. I don't think I got it. So I have. I mean, I mean, just call that back out.

The first one before the H is a J. So it's J. Yeah, J H M C R. Yeah, sorry about that. I'll get right to start counting. That's it. Okay, 17 Honda Accord. All right, and who is driving this? Sherman. My son. Okay, hon. So just to make sure we've got a 2013 Nissan Maxima, 2015 Chevy Impala, 22 Honda Civic, and a 2017 Honda Accord now. Yes, ma'am. Okay, and we're keeping the same coverages. Yes, please. Okay, see what the difference is. So it looks like it came down. I think it came down by 276 dollars. Oh, that's a blessing. How much is your normal? Do you know what your monthly payments are? I just paid it today. It was 50172. Okay, because it's saying your next installment is 47101. So yeah, that's that's a little bit there. Yep, 47101. It sure does. Very good. By the coverage is still the same though, and everything right. Everything is still the same. Yep, I just what I did. Rick was just replace that one, just replace the vehicle. So yeah, the coverage was changed over. Rolled over to the Honda Accord. Okay, that's great. Thank can I can you send me a new ID card? Yes, ma'am. Yeah, I'll get that email over to you. At three to eighty-two at Hotmail, right? Yes, ma'am. Okay, all right, girl. I appreciate you. You welcome. You know I'm trying to get my mama to come check with you and see she can get cheaper insurance. So I'm trying to send you. Yeah, okay. Okay, with I think. But did we look at your renters insurance? Is that where you you wanted your renters coverage? I can't remember if we ever did that. I was out of town. He was. I was out of town for two weeks, and also your brother he had texted me. Do you know what is he okay? Because I told him I told him I was out of town, but I told him to call. Yeah, no. So. National General directly. He. Did he explain to you what happened? No, I haven't. That's what I was out of town. So let me just give you a little quick rundown. So his he left his truck at his his kids or at his baby mama house they were moving. With him, she took the Um, more than likely, yes, but especially if it was a total loss and bodily injury, um, yeah, but um, but you know, I normally don't deal with the claim side, but I know if she had insurance, they could go back and and file it under hers, like even though they they have filed it for him, but they can always go back and fight and get hers to pay for it. I have a question for you, for about my insurance. So I know my son had two points. He hasn't had anything else on his. He ain't, Lord thinking he had no issues, but a lady hit his car. This is why he hit another car because she totally lost his car. She hit him when he came to lunch with me. Yeah, like two weeks she was flying in parking lot and hit him, and his car was totally lost. That shouldn't be on my insurance because her insurance pay for everything, right? Correct. Yes. Yes. Okay. Yeah. I just want to make sure they everything completed and closed. It was filed. It was on her state farm insurance. Let's see, and when was it? Just recently. It was recently they closed it. Jane the third. Was it Jane third? Wait, no. Because someone hit my daughter too, and totally lost her car. Oh, that was her. I think that was her. So his had to be. Oh my god, y'all. Yeah, she was leaving work. It has been a horrible. Yes, someone hit her not paying attention came right across the median part. There was four lanes. She just went straight forward and hit her on Renonda. Oh my goodness. Yeah, oh, with that. Now, now their insurance pays for that too, right? Yes, they did. It was a total loss. It was state farm. So. Do you do you have a report that shows that? For Chicago. Um. Did the police report have not at fault for her? They put the other person's at fault. I might still have it. Wait, I might still have a copy of the ticket on my phone. Okay. I don't know if it's going to do if it's going to help, but they do have that listed on here. Accident fault not determined. Now it should be right. That's because the lady had tried to call my insurance and file it, and when they got the police report, they see he put that it was a lot of ladies fault. And state farm took her. I said no, I don't want my insurance to file nothing, to do anything. And state farm. Yeah. Yeah, I see now it's got not at fault. It had fault not determined, and then it's got not at fault. I see that. Do you still need a police report? Oh okay. I think we're okay. Yeah, it's zero point. Just not charging you anything, but they paid everything. Yeah, it's got six three accident fault not determined. But then it's down below it. It's got not at fault accident same date. So I think it's fine. Okay. Do you need his? If you have it, yeah, because I would like to have it removed, regardless if it's showing zero. Okay. It'll be listed as at fault. I mean, fault not determined, but. Okay. And then his twin was when was it? Which recently. Uh, maybe a month ago because they just posted like a week and a half or week last week. You need a report or something from state farm. Um, the police report is is good if it if it tells on their not at fault. I don't think it says it just shows. And then so did you have state farm at this at that time? No, I have farmers at that time. State farmers the other lady. Okay. Anything you can send me? I got this right here. This might help you. Let me send it to your phone. Oops. Yeah, just send me anything that you can have anything that would provide proof that um any any of those accidents that. You know, if you got the accident report, it's great. If you can send me that. I just sent you the one for Chicago. Okay. And let me see if I can pull up his and print it to be look like hers. You see the whole. And I am not showing anything on his yet. Um, it just happened. It's probably happened yet, but. It's like a month ago they just closed it and paid it out. So yeah, yeah, anything you can send me would be helpful. Okay, I'll try to find it and I'll text it to you. Okay, and it might not. I mean, I don't know that it because what you said it's showing zero. So I don't know that it's even putting a surcharge
