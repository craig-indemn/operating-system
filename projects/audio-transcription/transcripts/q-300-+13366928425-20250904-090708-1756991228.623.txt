Thank you for holding. This is Holly. How can I help you? Hey Holly, this is Archie Reese. And um, I see my bill had went up, so. I was trying to see how can I get it back down. Okay, let me take a look at it with you. What's your address? 1438 B Series Field Drive Winston Salem, North Carolina. Thank you. Looks like a homeowners policy with travelers. Yes. Okay. All right. Yeah, so on the renewal, the renewal is on 8:30. It does look like there was an increase for the year of. To 200 and is this the right term? Let me see. Yeah, it was like 1400. Now I went to 1600. Okay, yeah, that's right. So yeah, great difference of 282 dollars for the year. Looks like it is due to North Carolina state rate increase as well as 31, 000. Additional coverage on the dwelling. So they're saying, in today's market, your dwelling coverage is bumping up to 234, 000. Let me go in here. Look at a couple more things. Your deductible is currently at a thousand. If you want me to quote going up to 2500, we could see what that would do to the premium for you. No, what could I take? Um, can you tell me what other structures are with that? If I took that 23, 40, 000 out, would that move it that down to? So, so other structures is a built-in coverage. It's 10 automatically of that dwelling coverage, so it is an option to take it off. So what are the options to take off? Um. I'm not. I don't see anything that I would suggest that you take off. The water backup is optional. That would cover anything that happens inside the home, like a pot burst or a back. Yeah. All those endorsements if you're looking at it under endorsements are optional, but I would keep all of that—the personal property, your replacement cost. The additional amount of coverage. That would come into play if the dwelling if you had a total loss and the dwelling coverage of 234 wasn't quite enough. Have additional coverage on. So could I move? Could I the dwelling? Could I move the dwelling down to like 200? Um, we can look at the replacement cost estimator, but that's calculated based on all the specifics of your home. I can go in here and look and make sure it's correct. Yeah, because they were saying even if I sold my home, it wouldn't be nothing but maybe 220. So. Yeah. We should look at it, but you got to keep in mind tax value and what you could sell it for is different from what you could rebuild it for. Trying to let me in here. Okay, let's see. And roof was. I had the roof year's 2018. That sound right. Yeah. Okay. Let's not let me rerun the replacement cost estimator. Let's see. Yeah, it's not going to let me change that dwelling coverage. Because that's it's what the they calculated from the replacement cost estimator. There ain't nothing I can knock this. It's like the 34 dollars. That's just so high. There ain't nothing I can move around. Let me look. I'm gonna just take one thing. Come on. Yeah, I was trying to look at the deductible to give you an idea on that, but it won't even let me. Quote the 2500. Do you have? Let me go over here. Do you have a mortgage or is it or no mortgage? No, it's paid for. Okay. Um. I can look at shopping it for you. Okay. Do you have um an auto policy or another policy? You'd like us to quote our biggest discount offer is the bundle. No. Okay. All right. Do you have any dogs on the property? No. Uh, what about a puller or a trampoline? No. Okay. All right. So I'm gonna go ahead and get this um shopped for you. And um I I'm out tomorrow, so it'll probably be Monday and I'll get back with you and let you know what I find. Okay. Okay. All right, it's 3368. Uh, sorry, 2870042. The best number for you. No, 3366928425. 8425. Okay, is that one an old number? Yeah, that's an old number. This, this my new number right here: 33669284
