This is Kendall. Kendall, hey it's Joe. How are you? I'm good. We were trying to figure out how to get your tickets for it over. It's all good. You got a quick minute? Yeah, I do. Chris Stevens on that Cape Cod workers' call. Yes, I did see your message, so I have a note to give him a call today. Yeah, he just reached out to me again. I'm coming back from. He's just in a little bit of a panic. That he's in a bad way and needs to get it handled today. He said he reached out and he's sorry he missed you because he knew you called him back but. Are you able? Are you got a spot where you can call him in the next little bit? Yeah, I can. I'll call him as soon as we're done. That is a big help. I really appreciate it. How's everything else? Everything's going pretty good. I sent the Marion Bright to Sensi to see if they could write that. I'm sorry my voice is off. I have a cold so. I think everybody's getting sick. Everybody's getting a little. Sick has been down now. I didn't wake. I woke up not feeling great today. Anyway, anything for me? I'll be back in the pilot office probably in an hour. Okay. Anything I need to tackle for you or take care of? I was thinking I had just chatted you on something a little bit ago, but I cannot remember what it is now. I'm trying to think. Well, I was gonna. Did you talk to Rick about Jupiter? No. Okay, I think Jeff had called or he had called Jeff earlier. I think he had gotten in touch with Christopher or something. He might have tried to call you before he called him. Uh huh. He's not. Okay. But CSU requested additional information for them, just about their security work. But I think he told Rick, I haven't had a conversation with Rick about it. But I think he told Rick that they. The security guards, in that contract and Raleigh, like the pay actually comes from them. So that's more than consulting. So I think we're going to have a hard time placing that one anywhere. But I'll have to talk to Rick and see exactly what was said. Okay, the last thing I recall, I think CSU needed more questions. 236 answered and I did forward that. Oh yeah, you did forward that to him. Okay, I do remember that now. I've not seen anything since then. Okay. Oh, I. Okay, I know, but I didn't know that piece of it. What you just told me. So yeah, I'll send out that. I do know one thing. I forwarded you. And sorry for my communication. Did you see that email I forwarded you about MRT business auto policy? It's probably probably within the last 30 minutes probably. It was the email outlook. Yeah, to remove the vehicle and add a new one, and add a driver. Yeah, and sorry about that, but that's just that's just what I could do at the moment. Normally, I would just build a case, but. No, that's okay. I can take care of it. Okay, well I appreciate it. I'll be back in the pilot office probably by three or a little later. If you need me, just let me know. Okay, sounds good. Thank you. Thank you. See ya. Bye.
