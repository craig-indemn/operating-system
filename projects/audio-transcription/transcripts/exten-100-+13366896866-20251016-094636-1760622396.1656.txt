Hey, Charlie. Yes, yes, this is him. Hey, um, I actually just left you a voicemail. Um, but anyway, so I spoke to Hayden and he told me that he moved out of that house, but that um Brian his dad still lives there. Um, so I pretty much just told him that you were out on the field today trying to get that inspection done. Um, so I verified Brian's number and he told me, or we actually haven't, that that's the right phone number. Um, so I called him but he didn't answer so I left him a voicemail. Okay, and that was the number fifty two forty. Nine three four fifty two forty. Fifty two forty. That was. Okay, that was Brian's number. Okay, well I left him a message as well. Um, so I, I'll just be waiting on a call back and we'll get this inspection done. Alrighty, sounds good. Thank you. Well, actually, I have another client that I need a number for. Um, this is going to be for Jason Rutledge. All right, and what's the address on that one? I have sixteen thirty two Sanford Drive.
