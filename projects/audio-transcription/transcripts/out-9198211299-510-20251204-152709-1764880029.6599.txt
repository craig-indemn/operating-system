Thanks for calling NCJUA. This is Morgan Snipes. How can I help you? Hi, it's Tracy calling from Alliance Insurance. Hello, how can I help? Um, I'm trying to quote a Mountain Cabin. And it when I do the verify address, it keeps changing the address on me. Uh oh. Um, let's see, what's that quote number? Q T zero one six three three seven six two. Okay. And that's for Mark and Paula Johnson. Yes. Okay. Let's see. Hmm. I wonder if it's because they're gonna want that B in the direction box. Well, the street name is also Katy Davis Road, and it keeps taking the word Katy out of it. Oh, that's weird. Yeah, that's what I thought. That's very interesting. Okay, so if you type it in correctly, type it in the way that you want it. But instead of tabbing through, like when you type in the zip code, don't don't do anything after that. Just go to the top and click save, and see if that will keep that address the same. And don't click the verify button or anything like that. Okay. Sometimes if it's like newer, yeah. It's still telling me it needs to be verified. That's fine. Um, as long as it's saved that way, that's okay. That um that little warning. Will be completely fine for you to finish your quote, to issue the policy, all of that. Oh okay. Oh, it did give me a number. Perfect. Yep, you'll be able to skip past it. So. Excellent. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Yeah. Not a problem at all. You have a great rest of your day. Thank you. You too. Thank you. Bye.
