Hello, this is Jeff. Hey, it's Tyler Adams and I sure are. Hey Tyler, how are you? I'm still embarrassed that I called you Keith. That's okay. How you been? I've been great. Hope you have been. Oh yeah, yeah. Matter of fact, I'm going to see Keith this weekend, and I will tell him again that you and I talk. Yep, that's right, that's right. I didn't see him in a minute. Hey, I know you're busy, so I'm just bending here real quick to see what the odds are of us trying Scenic Motors again. We are dropping our loss costs. What I would call fairly significantly effective one one. Okay. We're doing some restructuring and configuring with loss costs across the various states just based on the way that the new filings are going. In sure North Carolina. For these dealerships, one one we're dropping. Golly, I can't remember what the exact figure is compared to the rest of the market, but I think it's like a 22 or 23 percent. Net improvement, so it's quite a quite a bit of jump. And then for the four one and beyond, we're actually looking at an exception filing for that 8380 and 8742, some of those class codes. Sure. Okay. So just just at a high level, but what what do you think about Scenic? Would they be would they be up for a another shot or have they been fine with the entrust and don't want to move? Well, I think they've been fine with entrust, but at the same time, I think they would be willing to have a shot on their behalf. We're we're hoping you know we rode it at one time. Matter of fact, we just many many years. Just go ahead. Oh, sorry, I think we have a delay. I was talking over you. You're fine. You go ahead. Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me? Oh no, I was just saying we had Scenic for for many years. Yep. And so yeah, I mean not typically trying to cause people to jump around, but since we did have it at one time, they are familiar with us and we didn't get it last year. Just thought I'd see if there was a shot. No, we would be glad to have you guys take a look at it. As a matter of fact, we just went Christopher and I went and met with Justin within the last two weeks. About hopefully, hopefully obtaining all their business. It looks like that might be back in play as well. And part of that conversation was their workers' comp renewal and that we plan to remarket it as well. So yeah, I appreciate the information. I don't know that we've gotten an entrust renewal yet, so I'm not exactly sure how that looks. But I wonder the current policy ended up on on premium. I think ours was like 52. Yeah, it was in the neighborhood. I don't remember. I'm I should know better than I do, but I'm I'm thinking it was mid 40s, low to mid 40s. But but again, that's that's great. That's a that's a ballpark guess. Yeah, no, no, no, that's fine. It would that would that wouldn't surprise me in Security National Paper. So yeah, I mean our figures would get much more in line with that. Plus, you know, we're also working on and I don't know if it matters to them. We're working on payroll integration. So if they're working with a payroll company, our systems automatically syncing, and I know some of these dealerships were highly interested in that. So that's an interesting thing to think about. Well, I do know that email and just that way you've got something in your inbox to follow up on on our call. But yes, I would appreciate that. Yeah, just wanted to make sure that obviously I can ask over email about the Scenic Motors submission, but the fact that we've got you know a pretty good you know loss cost adjustments coming as well one one. I wanted to make sure we talked about that so you knew about it. Well, thank you for that. And to be honest, I need to let Rick. I need to make him aware of that because that's more of what he does for us. Well, I can do that. Well, I don't mind doing it either though because maybe you copy him on the email you send me. That'll save you an email that'll put it all on one correspondence. I am involved in the remarketing of Scenic, and just include Rick on that email so he can share that with the rest of the group about the reduction in loss costs. That'd be great. Perfect. All right,
