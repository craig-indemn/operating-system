Hello. Hi, is Jeremy available? Yeah, this is him. Hi, it's Tracy calling back from Alliance. Okay. Um, just wanted to give you a quick update. They're having some billing issues, so. The cancellation notice and the reinstatement, well, the amounts have not calculated correctly. Okay. If you're having that fixed, it's definitely not six or three. The next comment is. Just over two fourteen. Yeah, yeah. I actually did get through with them after we had got off the phone and they said the same thing as well. Okay. Good. They claimed they were supposed to fix it within seventy two hours, but they did say that they had removed the cancellation notice. Which they did. Okay. Yep, they did do that. So that is all taken care of, and I did ask her to put a rush on it. Okay. So hopefully it'll be done more sooner than later. Sounds good. At least I know I'm paid up a month ahead. So. Yeah, you're paid. I don't know what their issue is, but they're working on it. Yep, yep. Well, thank you for helping me out. You're welcome. You have a great day. All right, you too. Thank you. Bye bye.
