Thank you for holding this. Stacy, how may I help you? Hey, how you doing today? My name is Ramona James, and I um trying to see if I have towing because I need my car towed. Okay, give me one second. If you don't mind, just confirming your address for me, please. Thirty nine fifty four Sugar Creek Drive, Winston Salem, North Carolina two seven one zero six apartment seven one eight. Thank you very much. Give me one second while I pull up your policy. We'll take a look. What vehicle is this for? The Kia Rio. Okay, so you do have towing on it. What you would have to do is just contact the towing company and you would be reimbursed. Let me just double check here. Yes, you would be reimbursed one hundred dollars. So you would just call any towing company and then provide the receipt. They do have to add the vehicle, the VIN number, the date of service, what they did, how many miles. They towed and where it was towed to and from. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Okay. Have a good one.
