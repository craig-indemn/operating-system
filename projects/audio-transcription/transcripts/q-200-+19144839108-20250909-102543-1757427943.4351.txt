Thank you for holding. This is Heather. Oh, hi, Heather. My name's Heather as well. Hi. How are you? I'm I'm not doing great to be honest. I'm good. Hopefully you're doing better. Oh. I was referred to your company from a representative at Progressive, which is where I have car insurance. The long story short is that I have three water claims on my home in the last three years. And the long version is when I got divorced three years ago, I said, "Let me fix all this crap that my husband's been ignoring all these years," and I did. And I didn't know that I couldn't have three related water related claims in three years. If someone had told me that, I would have put other stuff off till later. But I didn't know that, and I'm really upset and hurt by the insurance company that you know if you like get to do something you tell someone. And I'm just advocating for my home. All of the damages didn't occur over the course of three years. They occurred over the course of you know ten years, but I just handled them all at once because I thought that that I was doing a great job. So now I'm looking for a new insurance company, and I recommended to reach out to you all. So here I am. You were with Progressive. No, this is Amika. Amika for home insurance. Gotcha, gotcha. Yeah, so how much did they pay out in the last three years? Um, I don't have the exact amount, but it was about. It was under twenty thousand. And it was three separate claims. Yeah, unfortunately, like one of them, I wouldn't actually two of them, I wouldn't even put through. They were things that had been lingering for a while, and there was only one that was an actual emergency, like we're a pipe leak. Gotcha. What's your address? It's number six, Long L O N G Cove C O B E Port, and that's in Greensboro. Who insures your auto? Progressive. Okay. And I know they can't do it either. They have, interestingly enough, they have a you if you have two. Water related damages they won't take you. Yeah, most carriers all all mine are going to be that way. I will. I will suggest. Well, have you called anyone else? I have one other one last company to call that was suggested. And I'd like what I want to do is fight Amika, but I can't. Yeah, and like I said, most carriers we I mean we write with about twenty different carriers and none of mine will take it either. Like you said, more than more than two or two, nobody's going to touch it that I can write with, and then someone even with one if it's major. And I'm talking like you know a major probably more than thirty thousand. But I know some carriers will be willing to write it if you like. Install a water shut off valve. Automatic water shut off valve. That's something to check into. But like I said, I know none of us going to do it. And it's that I understand. I feel your pain. I wish I could help you. Have you tried Farm Bureau? No, I have not. Try them. I've heard. I think I think I want to say that they are willing to take some of that. Not one hundred percent sure, but it's worth a call. Okay, I appreciate that. And then Erie maybe I'm not sure again. I think what's going to happen is going to end up being placed with like what they call the lender. Oh, lender forced by. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I I don't mind that it's dwelling only. Now I'm just talking to your name is Heather. I have no talk to you. No, and that's oh that's another one. You know, I was going to say your last resort is going to be at NCJUA. That's the North Carolina Joint Underwriters. And yeah, I mean, you know, there's no no liability. Right. I also learned in the past forty-eight hours I've been learning a lot. This sticks with you for five years. You like my my. Oh yeah. Be clear to get new insurance again for kind of like bankruptcy six seven years like this is going to fall. I'm so like outrage that an insurance company wouldn't say something you know. When you said I did not say anything like. Like I had questioned it too when I made the third when I made the third claim because you know people talk and my neighbor was like oh they're going to drop you and I was like what are you talking about. I said if I make this claim am I going to be in you know jeopardy of losing coverage and they were like oh absolutely not. And here
