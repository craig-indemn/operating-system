I can do it over the phone and save you the trip over here if you want. Ah, let me. No, the problem is I don't I don't have the money on the on the on the card. I have I got a cash. Oh, okay. Can you put it in your account and then I can use your account? I have to go to the bank anyways. Okay. Yeah. You want to go to the bank and then let me know when that's done and then I can get it paid for you. All right, all right. Yeah, just give me a call whenever you go by there and put it in. Do you remember how much it was? No, I don't remember. Um. Let me look here. Hold on a minute. You have a good Christmas. Ah, yeah, is the bank is the bank open today? You know. Oh, that's a good question. Um. I would think that they're open, but I'm not. I'm not positive of that. What bank is it? Ah, Wells Fargo. It says they're open, but I don't. You might want to call over there first just to see. Mhm. Because I'm not sure online it says that they're open, but I don't know if. If they actually are or not, that's not always correct. What it says online, you know. Oh yeah, they show open. It shows open online, but you might just want to call over there just to double check. I would think that they're open, Patricia, but. Yeah. It's possible that they're not, but I I think that they are. Let me see how much this amount is. Give me just a second here. So the total for the two months that are due plus the non compliant audit is forty seven fifteen. Forty seven fifteen. Yes, sir. All right, I'll be there. Okay. Oh, I'll give you a call. Yeah, just give me a call once you go by the bank and then I'll just get your um your information and I'll get it paid for you. All right. Thank you, sir.
