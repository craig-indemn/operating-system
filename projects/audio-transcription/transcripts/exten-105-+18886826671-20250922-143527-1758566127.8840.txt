This is Rick. Hi, my name is Rachel from Employers. I'm just responding back to your callback request. Thank you, Rachel. I appreciate that. All right. And what was your first name? I'm sorry. That's okay. My first name is Rick. Okay, and Rick, a good callback is the three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Yes. Okay, and you're calling in on a claimer for a policy today. No, this is tech support for the website portal. Oh, I see. Okay, and Rick, what is the name of the agency? Alliance Insurance Services. Okay, and the first initial of your last name. H. All right, perfect. Okay, let me go ahead and bring up the information. So I do already see an email that's in here. So what difficulties were you having getting logged in? I am getting this infamous your computer clock is five minutes off actual time message. I don't know how to solve that. What looks like to me. Oh, okay. So if it is correct, what I'm going to do is I'm going to put your email in so we can essentially view all of your logs to take a look to see what's happening with it. Yeah, so there is it does look like you will need to actually close everything, Rick. Close out of all tabs and then what you're going to do is you're going to clear your browsing data. And then everything will be reset on my side. Just let me know when the browsing data has actually cleared. Okay, yeah, I'll need a few minutes at least to do that. I've got a lot of stuff working in the background that I need to probably prioritize over that. If that's okay, so is that something I'm going to need to call you back on? Well, I mean, if you don't have necessarily you know that time to do it now, I would clear your browsing data. Yeah. Um, and then that should resolve that issue. So a lot of times you know. That does happen, but that would be an option. Yeah, what happens when I if I do it while I've got certain apps open, particularly Microsoft Office and our cloud service? It logs me out of everything and I've just got I've just got some work I need to save you know before I do that. So so let me. Oh, you do. Let let me try the you know clear the cache a little bit later today when I can close some some active work down. Oh, god. Yeah. You think that'll work? That's fine. I try to clear it every so often, but it probably has been a couple weeks since I cleared it. So let me just try that. If it works great, if it doesn't, I'll just give you a call back. How's that? Okay, yeah, and you do also want to make sure Rick that you're not logging in through a saved link that you have. Sometimes they become faulty. So if you're logging in through our website, theemployers dot com, you can actually sign in. Yeah, you can sign in from there. Hold on just a minute. Let me just let me just try that right quick because I was using a saved link. We use a password, you know, saved or your last password. Just give me a second. Let me click that link and see if it does anything different. Wow, look at that. Thank you. Problem solved. I'll just need to remember not to use my last password. Maybe I'll change that link as well. Perfect. Oh, perfect. Okay. I'll know what to do next time maybe, and I appreciate it. I'll be able to log this code in now. Good deal. Oh, perfect. Thanks, Rick. Have a great day. And you too. Thank you.
