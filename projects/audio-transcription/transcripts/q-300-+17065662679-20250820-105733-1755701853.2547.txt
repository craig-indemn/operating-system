Thank you for holding. This is Holly. How can I help you? Good morning, Holly. This is Mark Corey. And we have four vehicles and a homeowner's policy with you. We have purchased property in Georgia now, so we have two two properties, but three of the vehicles that we have have now been titled in the state of Georgia and we are covered on an insurance policy there now. So I need to cancel the the auto insurance on those three vehicles and I've turned in the tags to those three vehicles to the state of North Carolina and I have a receipt. Okay. All right, let me get this pulled up here. What's your address that we have, Corey? Six hundred three Fox Brier Drive. Gotcha. I'll tell the last name. Yeah. Okay, 9710. All right, which three are we needing to take off? The 2014 Jeep. The 2004 Chevrolet truck. And the 2010 Ford Multi Purpose SUV. We'll see the escape maybe. Escape, escape, yeah, escape. Okay, gotcha. So the only one that'll be left is the 2010 F150. Correct. Okay. And what day did you turn in the tags for those? The tags were turned in on 815. Okay, is that the same day you got coverage elsewhere? No, actually, the the we got a Georgia title on those vehicles on on July 18th. Okay, all right, very good. So we would need to do it the day you turn in the tags. So I can do it the 15th to take all those off for you. Okay. All right. Are you going to be doing the F150 in Georgia as well or no? Um, not right away. It's going to be it's going to be a while before we do that. Okay. All right. Well, I can get these three taken off for you. Is there anything else I need to look at right now? Oh, um, do you want to um let's see, um because I'm kind of split going back and forth. I'm ordering the mailing address that you have. If maybe we should update that, I want to see what you have on that. All right, let's see mailing. Mailing billing address. Just pull up the actual document here. Okay, yeah, I still have the Fox Fox Brier Drive for the mailing. Yeah, so can we shift the shift the mailing address to the Georgia address? Yeah, sure. What is that? That is 117 Hoot Owl Lane. Okay. And that zip code is 31024, and that is in Eaton, Georgia. Okay. And you want me to update that on the auto and the homeowner's policy. Yes, please. Okay, I can do that for the billing. Yep, that'd be perfect. Hi, I will get those submitted for you. All right, thank you very much. You're welcome. You have a good day. You too. Bye.
