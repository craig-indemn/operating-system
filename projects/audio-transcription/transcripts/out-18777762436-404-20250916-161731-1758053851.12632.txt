Thank you for calling Progressive. This is Nicole. May I have your first and last name, please? Hi Nicole, this is Gloria Bow, and I'm calling from Alliance Insurance. Hey Gloria, how are you doing today? I'm doing great. Thank you for asking. How are you doing today? I'm doing pretty good. Thank you. I just see a policy that came up for Manny's trucking. Are you the agent of record for them? Me, yes, ma'am. All right, and may I have your agency code? Three two seven zero one. All right, thank you. Appreciate that. How can I help you today? I wanted to confirm something in the policy. They wanted to see if the policy has no commodity or theft exclusions for automotive parts. Say that one more time. If it has what? It has no commodity or theft exclusions for the automotive parts. No theft. Okay. When you say auto parts, like are they delivering parts or parts on the car? That's where the so the one of the certificate holder from the the client. Has been out asking if this is this policy doesn't have that exclusion, and I tried looking on the policy but I couldn't find any kind of details so I'm not certain is it the automotive parts in the vehicle or what they deliver so I. I'm kind of not certain what they are referring to. Yeah, because I mean that's I'm not sure either which one are they talking about. Okay. Let's try to figure it out. Like. Where did they come up with this stuff? Like you and I both are going to say, "Well, where did they come up with this?" Yeah, I'm like, I'm looking at this. I'm like, what are they? What are they asking? What are you talking about? Yeah. Oh my gosh. And and I think that's a really valid question for both of us because one of their commodities is automobiles. So are you talking about the automobiles that they're picking up or their automobile? Like I don't know what they're referring to. When they say we cover that, like they have, so you and I both so they have comprehensive and collision. Yes. So comprehensive and collision would cover the vehicle. You know what I'm like, their vehicle, the vehicle that we're insuring. But I don't know if they're talking about, like you said, the commodity side of it where it says automobiles. Yeah, so. A good question. I don't know. I'm I'm not sure. What else? If we go on the, let's say if we are to try and figure out as in if they have this provision for the commodity day transport. Is there? Okay, so you're wondering if. Yes. Yeah. I'm with you. I mean, I don't know. Like that's that's a really good question because we're covering the commodities under the motor truck cargo. So, but they're specifically wanting to know about the part on the the automobile themselves. Let's see. Let's look at this definition. The motor truck cargo coverage pays when you are responsible for damage to or loss of the cargo you are transporting due to fire, collision, or even hitting. Or running over the cargo that you transport. That's the definition for the motor truck cargo. I don't hear anything about automobile parts on that one. I'm thinking that's more of a claim question. The only other thing I can think of. Is the contract itself? Okay. Let me see. And I guess we can go in there together because sometimes those contracts are a little crazy. I can show you how to get to the policy contract if that will help. I'm headed that way too, but. All right. So if you are on, for agents only. Yes. At the top of, hang on, I'm sorry, I'm caught up trying to find your agency code again so I can put it in here. At the top, you'll see where What theft exclusion. Exclusions. For automotive parts. Automotive parts. Oh boy, these end of the day things. I'm like man. I don't even know what to say. Yeah, I saw the email. I was like, okay. Okay. I feel like this is. A claims. Thing, but let me make a quick call. I'll ask my support team. I have a feeling that's what they're going to say because I've learned to stuff like this before. But um. If you want to look through that um. The what they call. Contract. And if you do Control F, you'll get a little box. And maybe um type in commodities or theft exclusions. Maybe theft exclusions. And then it'll highlight all of you know exclusions throughout or thefts throughout. Maybe that'll take you to the right place while I'm checking with them. All right. All right. I'll be right back. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, right. Thank you so much for holding. I'm sorry for that long hold. We were we were deep in it in conversation over here with the what we needed. Yeah. Okay, so. I've got some news. I found what we were looking for, but. The policy is not written that way. So. There is a motor truck cargo um exclusion form. That can be done through the support team that I just talked to. But. This policy is not set up as an auto hauler. Okay. So if they're if they're hauling autos, that's what business class they need to be under. Okay. Yeah. And you know I you know you probably know as much as I do changing that is going to increase their premium. Um. But yeah, that and I'm guessing if they're hauling the autos, it's being done with that 1997 Hoffman. Um, I'm guessing I'm guessing that's rated properly. We'd have to cross that bridge whenever we would make the change. Um. But yeah, there is a form. So they what they're referring to does exist. But we have to make those changes in that policy to get that form. Okay, so it needs. Is the way the policy set up right now? What's that? Um, the policy need to be reclassified. Yes. Okay. And it it doesn't have to be rewritten because it's in the LLC. It's all that good stuff. It's just not. Rated the way it's supposed to be. If if they are in fact hauling autos. Do you know if they're specifically hauling autos? So they're kind of all over the place. I just need to get to speak to we need to speak to the client and get to the bottom of this and see if there's a need to. Of course. Do all the adjustment needed. Okay, because I can put it to you this way because where where she led me to in our what we call guidelines in our policies and procedures was an area for a risk with multiple um business types. And when I the one of the first bullet points in there is um business involving any of the following must be rated as a business type. Coal hauling, steel hauling, auto hauling. So automatically, if that's what they're doing, then that's what we have to rate it as. Okay. So um. That's how we came to that, and in order for us to um do that form that she was just talking about that she just showed me. Everything has to be in place in the policy in order for them to complete that form, and it's it's nothing for them to complete it once everything is lined up. Okay. Yes, it does exist. Okay, perfect. It's a good thing we know it's there. It exists. Yeah. And and what she said was that broker that they're probably trying to deal with knows that it's not the policy isn't the way it's supposed to be. That's why they're asking for the form. Okay. They probably saw it. Yeah. Okay. Yep. All right. Perfect. I will speak to the producer for this account and then we can see how we can help them. All right, and just just to help you out, if you have if they if they decide they want to go that route, and we get everything straightened. When you call in, yes, you do have to go through one of us to get the support team to make this form. It's called hang on, let me let me move it a little closer to my face. Summary of exclusions, limits of insurance, and special conditions. So the motor truck cargo exclusion form. That's all they have to tell the support team, and they they know where to go with it. She knew exactly what I was talking about. Okay. Okay. Yes, perfect. Oh boy, that was fun. What a way to end the day,
