Hello, this chef, can I help you? Hey, honey, I understand you need to speak to me. Yes, I do. We're trying to get this bond finished up for you, and there's a section that I wasn't quite sure how to answer. Okay. It in the middle of it, it asks, it says construction contract, and then it says date. What date do I need to use for that? The contract was written on nine nine. Okay, so I can put nine nine. That's fine. Yeah. All right, and amount. The thirty one thousand whatever it was. So the amount of the bond is the same as the amount of the contract. Is that right? That thirty one three fifty seven. Okay. Yeah. And it says description. Now you gave me owner Kanawa County Schools, Charleston, West Virginia. I have all that. What do I need to put for description? Description of what the building. Well, the contract or the construction what what the job is I guess. It's a. To install a prefabricated metal building. Alright, install prefab metal building. Should be good enough. Let me see if there's anything else. Name and location. Do we have? Do we know a location? Yeah, fifty seven man. It's three three zero zero Pennsylvania Avenue. Okay, so that'll be the location two. Yeah. Okay, got it. I think it's Charleston, West Virginia. It is Charleston, West Virginia two five three zero two. Okay. All right. Now what I've got, what I'm going to have is two separate bond forms. I'll have mine signed, but the corporate seal is kind of a raised seal. Is it going to be okay if I email this to you? Will they accept that? Do you want to emailed and mailed? What what can we do to get this to you, so they'll take it? Email it and then mail it to me. Okay, I'll do both. All right, perfect. Okay, I think that's it. If I need anything else, I'll let you know. All right. Thanks, you will. Bye.
