Good. Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, man. My name's Stephen Leak. I actually called for. Need to see about how I need to handle something. Over the weekend, I was my truck was my toolbox was cut out of my truck and stolen. So I made a report. Yeah, it was about four or five thousand dollars in tools. Oh nice. Yeah. That's. I made a report. It actually happened. I fished all night Saturday night on High Rock Lake. I got back Sunday morning about eight o'clock and realized the box had been cut out. It was chained in my truck. My goodness. And they cut the chain and the chain's gone. The box is gone. Again, I made their police report. They said it would be a couple days before it was available. So I'm just trying to figure out how I need to go about handling this. Okay. Well, give me one moment and I will get an agent that can help. Thank you, huh? You're welcome.
