Hey Bradley, it's Heather. How are you? Hey Heather, good. How are you? Doing good. Um, so I did try and call you back yesterday. So sorry about that. Um, but I went ahead and added the rental because I think that you already wanted that. So that has been taken care of. Um, but you directly had just some questions about the policy, right? Yeah, um, I guess one like deductibles. Um, was curious if I increase the deductible somewhat. If that would lower the premium, say like the collision. Increase it to five hundred dollars. Yeah, so are we wanting to just do this on the Santa Fe? Um, probably on both. Okay. And just wanted to see how that would impact the rate. I mean, like because I'm pretty, I wouldn't submit a claim for less than five hundred. I don't think because. Probably just a you know the cost would go up in the long run. Gotcha. I'm just going to go in and we can quote this for you. And the um, other thing is I don't know, we have a small dog, pet coverage. That's. So there would be no pet coverage necessarily on the auto, but we could look at options. Um, through another carrier. And we can get into that. We'll do the auto first, and then I'll. I can quote the. The pet coverage, okay. Okay. Okay. And I don't know if it matters, but also I've I paid the loan off. I mean, I only did a loan because they gave a discount for doing a loan, but I. Paid it off on Saturday, so. Okay. So we can go in and remove that as well. Yeah. So it looks like the difference in the replacement that we did, um, was only thirteen dollars and like fifty six cent. So that is all that's owed right now. Um, but if we took the collision for the Mini Cooper. And the Santa Fe up to five hundred. Then let's see what the change is. It's only going to bring it down nine dollars and three cent. Um, and that would be from today's date until ten one. So I would honestly say. It's not worth it. Yeah. Um. That's probably not worth it. Yeah, I mean that's like roughly two months, but you're only saving nine dollars. I would say our best time to maybe check this is right before your renewal, and I can make a. Reminder for myself to check in with you like nine the beginning of September, and see if it would make sense to increase collision deductibles to five hundred at that point. Okay. That way would be for the full term. Yeah. Um. Is the. Rate overall just in general terms likely to go up significantly since it's a newer car at that point. Um, I wouldn't say significant, but there are rate revisions that we're we're seeing. Um, July one, that have come through for quite a few carriers. So there could be just some rate that progressives has. Taken that might be a factor. Also, let's see if we have. We do have your home with travelers. And the umbrellas with Arilla. So I mean we can always look at options too if this is a significant increase of other places to go. Whether that be travelers to just get that bundle, um, or another standalone auto, but I would say that would be our best time to maybe navigate that versus two months before your. Renewal. Yeah, that makes sense. Um, and the okay, so yeah, you said October first is the renewal, so yeah. Um, and I'll. I'll actually be out of the country the first couple weeks of September, but. So if we could touch base, I guess maybe. Yeah, even or just maybe. At the calendar like the 15th or something, if that allows enough time. Yeah, I mean that would give us two weeks, so we would have time. I'm going to go ahead and remove the lien holder though effective today. Um, and that way that is removed. Okay. Right, and then I will. I'll probably work on this earlier than the 15th, but if that is a better time for you and you'll be back stateside, then we can have a conversation then. Yeah, um, that would be perfect. Okay, that sounds good. Anything else that I can help with? Um. No, not not at this time. Okay, that sounds good. Thank you. Okay, thanks, Heather. Okay. Bye.
