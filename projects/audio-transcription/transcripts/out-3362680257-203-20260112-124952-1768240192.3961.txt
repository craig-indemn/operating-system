Hello. Hi Jennifer. Yeah, this is Maria at Alliance Insurance Services. I never heard back from you guys to see if you decided to turn the tags in or if you just want to leave this policy active for now. Oh yeah, we did. I turned them in on Friday. I forgot to give you a callback. I think it was already pretty late though. That's okay. You want to make that effective. Let's see here. The ninth. Yeah, that's fine. We can make that effective actually today. That way there's no confusion on or being any gap in coverage. So let's see here. Let's see. It is going to come to the email address. Let me get over here to it. Okay. I don't think we have a good email address for her. Let me put one in. What's a good email address? I can send this cancellation form too. Give me one. Yeah. Like baby, like baby's gonna have one. It's gonna be um. Um Juanita. Mhm. Six nine. S at icloud.com. Juanita six nine s at. Icloud.com. Icloud. Yes. Dot com. Okay. Okay. I will send this cancellation form over to that. You just need to electronically sign it and it'll come back to us. And we'll get that processed for you. Okay, I'll let her know. Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.
