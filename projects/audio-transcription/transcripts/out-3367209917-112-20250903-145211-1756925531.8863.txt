Hello. Hey, is this Miss Cooper? Yes. Hey, Miss Cooper. This is Brandi with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good. I was reaching out to you to review over your home and auto insurance that's going to be renewing here soon. Do you have a few minutes? Yes. Okay. Um. So I still have your mailing address is one fifteen Overdale Road in Winston Salem. Is that correct? Yes. All right. And I'm gonna do your auto policy first. Is there with me? Let me switch to that. Um. We have. A 2018 Nissan Kick. Um for your vehicle is that correct? Yes. All right. The coverage that we have on this vehicle is. Let's see. A comprehensive at one hundred dollar deductible collision five hundred dollars. So that's what you would pay if an accident were to occur. Um. And then you also have, of course, the liability that covers you in an accident. It covers the other person that you hit or that something that you hit. And you do have towing or roadside assistant on this policy as well. Um. Would you want to keep all your coverages the same for this coming year? Uh, I guess so. How much um do you pay for roadside assistant? Um. Typically, it's like uh twenty dollars, but let me see. What yours is. So yours is actually only six dollars and two cents for the year for this vehicle. And then you also have renting rental coverage. So if you were in an accident and you needed a car a rental car while yours is in the shop being fixed, you also have that coverage on your policy and that is for thirty five dollars and fifty five cents for the year. Okay. Um. So your renewal if we keep all the coverages the exact same, your renewal um for the whole year is going to be one thousand three hundred and forty two dollars and two cents. Um. Did you receive the renewal documents? Um in the mail. Not yet. Okay. We'll make sure that that gets out to you. Um. And then. See. And I see that you still have your um policy set up as semi annually so you'll pay in October. Six hundred and seventy one dollars and two cents and then you'll pay again next April the same amount. What am I? I have um. I paid straight out really. Okay, so you pay in full. Yeah. Okay. Let me go ahead and change that. That way it's set up like that. So if you pay in full, it's the full thirteen forty two and then two cents. Okay. Okay. All right. And then with your home, I'm gonna go back to your stats. Have you done any updates on your home in the past year like a new roof or maybe a new deck or updated kitchen anything like that? No new roof, but I have an update of just paint the cabinet so that it wouldn't don't. Okay. Okay. So this year we did have a statewide rate increase on home policies, and what the insurance companies are doing is that they're giving more coverage on the home because. Your home value goes up every year as well, and so they need to make sure that they have enough coverage and materials to rebuild your home from the bottom up. So they did increase your coverage from two hundred and fifty two thousand to two hundred and ninety one thousand five hundred. Um. So you did get more coverage this year on that. Um. That also increased the policy as well. I'm trying to get back to my screen to show you how much that is. So it increased your policy about four hundred and eighty six for the year, but if you divide that by twelve as far as monthly goes, it's about forty dollars monthly and that's about the average for this year is forty dollars. I haven't seen anything lower than that. I have seen a lot more higher, but not anything lower than that. Okay. Um. So if you. This one is due. This one is due in September, September 14th. Um. And you typically pay for your homeowners insurance too, correct. All right. So this one's gonna be one thousand four hundred and thirty five dollars for the year. Okay. So the. Two is like two thousand. What. So both of them together. It's two thousand. But. So it's two thousand seven hundred and seventy seven dollars and two cents altogether. And uh, the first one's due September the 14th. Yes, September 14th, and then your auto would be um in October. Yeah, October 10th. I I didn't remember when the house one was due. And I haven't received anything on it either. Yeah, most of the time they send it out a month. They'll send it out by mail a month before. Uh, your policy is due.
