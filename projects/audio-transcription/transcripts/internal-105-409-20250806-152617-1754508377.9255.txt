Hey Corbin. Hey Rick. What's up? Gotta ask you something. You bet. Um, so I got time properties on the phone and um, he wants to ask you a question. Can I conference him in? It's a it's a quick question. Yeah man, no problem. Hang on, once again, we call Steve. I'm gonna call you. He's on my cell. I'm gonna call you. Okay, bye. Hello, Steve Phillips. Hey Steve, got Rick on the phone. Hey Steve, what's up? Beautiful. Hi Rick, so um we have a bond with the city of High Point for stormwater. Okay. Installation and maintenance, and this bond's a couple years old and basically when we wrote up the bond and we sent it to you, it was that we pay we have to bond eighty five thousand dollars of it for eighty foreign change. Okay. For the installation of the bond of the stormwater, then once they approve approve the installation, we can reduce it to just twenty five percent of its value. For one year of maintenance. Okay. Twenty five of eighty five. Well twenty five percent, so it's seventeen thousand dollars. I have the exact figures. I'm just giving you that. Plus or minus. Right. But but the thing that's confusing is that the bond renewed on six twenty eight. They passed inspection on seven eighteen. Right. And they said that once the once the new bond is in place, they release the old one. So I'm trying to figure out: am I reducing a bond? Am I you know reducing eliminating one and putting in a new one or how's the best way to do this? That's a great question. I don't know until I find out, Steve. I think that. What I'm going to start with is asking. I'm assuming we bonded this with travelers. Is that right? Yes, there. Yeah, so so I'm just going to ask my underwriter there. Look, can we modify this existing bond and lower the limit based on the reasoning that you just gave me? And I don't know if they're going to ask me. Steve, it wouldn't shock me if I if I got a request you know from travelers to say okay, can somebody from the city of High Point put that in writing? You know, because I mean just me randomly asking to lower. Well, I actually have it in writing from the city of High Point. Yeah, forward me that please. That's a beautiful thing. Yeah, and I will talk to him. Okay, you got it. I will forward this all to you. Do that and if and I think the worst thing they might tell me is we would we would release the original bond, rewrite another bond. The problem with that is I don't know how they would treat the premium that you've already paid. You just paid it in June for an eighty five thousand dollars bond. You know. That's the thing. I'm trying not to not to pay for the eighty five in the seventeen. So yeah, yeah, we don't want to double dip it and so but I just this is a little bit unusual. You know I don't I've never seen them come back and say we're going to lower. I will I will forward this I will forward this to you. Yeah yeah let me let me let me review it let me talk to the underwriter about it they've probably seen it before and it probably easier and I think it is but but just yeah give me a chance to drill down on it and we'll reach back out as soon as I have a solution for you. Thank you. I appreciate that. You bet, guys. Talk to you later, Rick. Thanks, Corbin. Thanks, Rick. All right, bye now, Philip. Bye bye.
