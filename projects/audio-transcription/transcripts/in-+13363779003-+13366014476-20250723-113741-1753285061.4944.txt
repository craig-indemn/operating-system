Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Trying to reach Christopher Cook. Okay, um, so he is out of the office this week, um, as he is on vacation. Can I send you to his voicemail, or can anybody else help you? Is is he the the I think he's the managing member there. Does he have a counterpart or is he the the main guy? He's the yeah, so he's the owner. Okay. Um. Okay, I guess what I was looking at is my current, um, representative. I'd like to figure out if I can change representatives. So I guess he would be the one to talk to though, right? Um. What do you mean? Like change, get a different agent. Yep. Same with you guys, a different agent. Gotcha. Who's your agent now? I prefer not to say. Um. Okay. Until like I said, I can speak with someone that that can give me some guidance on this. Okay. Um. Well, what I can do is um, either I can send him over to your voic his voicemail or. Um. You can send me to his voicemail. That'd be fine. Okay, and then your name was. Marty Oliver. Marty Oliver.
