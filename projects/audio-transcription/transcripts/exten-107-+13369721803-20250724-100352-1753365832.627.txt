Thank you, bro. Yeah. Hey Cecilia, this is Nancy Holmes. Um, so what happened here? So, um, back in May, I think we there was a change made of adding a vehicle, taking off a vehicle, or something like that. No, we we took Mark. Okay, back in May we took Mark's name off. Oh. Because she had passed away. Yes, and then there was another one. I think maybe March. Hold on, I am getting the dates mixed up. No nothing, nothing in March. Hang on. Let me get in there. Then I am a no, um, because we bought that car in February. So we switched out the car in February. Uh, took the Yaris off, added the Highlander. And then in May we took Mark's name off the policy. And they sent me this ridiculous policy. And we went through and found ten national. And there was a mix up in which I got a letter saying they had to reinstate the insu the insurance for some change reason. Because some dates were sent in incorrectly, but it wasn't my fault on the dates being sent. I don't think it was my fault on the dates being sent incorrectly. Yeah, so February was when we removed. The Yaris. Oh, the no Yaris and added the Highlander vehicle. Okay, so then that that made it go up. And then in May is when we made the change. That's Mark off because she passed away. Yes, and unfortunately with them and a lot of carriers there is a marital discount. So out us doing that it increased the rate again. Um, and then what happened was your due dates technically were the twentieth of each month. But the drafts were happening on the second of each month, so it was drafting like a week. Back basically or in the rears, so that's where it it's coming from. And what I had them do, I was like, okay, well let's total with all the changes that were made, right? Um. How much was that total premium, and then how much were all the payments that we've taken? Um. From the account total to see where the difference is, and that's where the difference is coming from. It's seventy two dollars short from. Everything that was added up, and there is like no additional cancellation fees or anything. It's just saying hey, by this day we should have taken this much money in, and we only took this much, and that's why there is a seventy two or seventy dollars difference. Okay, so there there is because they had to reinstate the insurance for some weird weird reason. Remember, I got that letter about them reinstating because they had the wrong dates. They they washed that out. That's not the charge. No, no, no, that that's like it washed out like it didn't happen. So. Okay. Yeah, they basically you know canceled it and charged you for it, but then they go went back in here and put the same credit of what they they charged the policy. I am looking at it. And it washed out. I I don't even know if I have the bill anymore honestly because it infuriated me. I know. So because this is freaking ridiculous, they were overcharged dramatically to start with. Yes, I I can agree with that. I mean, I can definitely agree with that. But yeah, like I said, it's you know again, it was another team member and myself that we went both of us called back and forth. Um, and we did get them to like okay, well tell us how much was you supposed to be charged, and then how much did you collect, and that's where the seven the seventy. Hang on, let me go to the billing page. May not be seventy two thirty nine. It's coming from yeah. So they're not charging you any extra, but yes, I agree. There is. In a normal situation, there is usually no additional bill from the company once we cancel, especially with travelers. Some companies do charge on a cancellation fee, what we call a short rate, and that formula is way more complicated. That honestly, I can't even explain because. We don't have access to that formula. Is there any way that you um my behalf can explain the situation of my husband dying and everything else and see if they'll waive the seventy two dollars because they're not out the seventy two dollars. It didn't cost anything. We didn't have a ticket. We didn't have anything. Yeah, I can yeah I can go back and ask and let them know and see what they tell me and then I can call you back. Okay, because I am not really sure when I am going to have that extra seventy two dollars to pay them. Okay, because I am still battling with everything financial. So yes, if you would please do that, I would appreciate it because this is
