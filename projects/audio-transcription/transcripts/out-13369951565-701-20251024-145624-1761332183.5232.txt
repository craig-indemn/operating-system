Hello. Hey Shelly, it's Jeremy. Sorry, I hit the wrong button. That's okay. I was going to ask you if you would look. You know I've been looking at so many of these declaration pages, but will you look on the page you sent him to sign for the rental property on 540 Pepperidge that you sent to State Employees? Because I think that I read that the roof on there was 2016, but he updated that roof, and I want to say it was 2020 or 2022. Or 2022. I can't remember, buddy. Redid the roof a year after he bought the house. Okay, and that won't with that company. It won't change anything, in the sense of price or anything at this point. If he's got documents on there, so we can we so we can all remember when it was. And that's and that's fair too. Yes, ma'am, I completely understand that. So what what if he's got? If it's less than five years old, they're going to require documentation to be provided. So if he's got like invoice from materials he bought back then when he replaced it. State Farm did it. State Farm did it. So it was done through the claim then. Okay. Yeah. And I saw on the sheet. That's what made me think of it because when I was looking at the renewal that they sent over for that house or the declaration page that Brett sent from State Farm, I saw it and then I saw that one and I thought I need to make sure they're the same. So if there's ever any issues later on, it shows that it was updated. Okay. They have it on their page. Okay. All right. So one of the pages I sent to you that has from them has that on there, and I want to say it was 2020, maybe it was 2022, but it was one of those because it's a fairly new roof. Gotcha. Okay, purchase. So let me go into that real quick. I was it's funny I told you I was going to call Tiffany. I called her, she's already emailed me and I'm getting ready to send her the stuff now. Because I told well I told her on the voicemail when I talked to her I said look, I don't want us scrambling next week and you know you catch me and I'm not able to do it right at that moment. The sooner I get this done, it's one more thing that you can check off your list too. So just help me help you help you basically send me send me something. So yeah, I will take a look on the rental there. Shelly, let's see. No, that State Farm has it listed on there somewhere. I don't know where right now. Let me um. So if you look at that, my other lines ringing. So let me get that. But if you need me or can't find it, call me and I'll look on my page. Yes, ma'am, we'll do. Thanks. You bet.
