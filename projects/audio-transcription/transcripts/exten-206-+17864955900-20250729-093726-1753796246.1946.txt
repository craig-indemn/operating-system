Hello, this Jeff, can I help you? Hi Jeff, you helped me out yesterday in renewing my bond. Yeah. And um, in the email you sent me, I have the receipt, but I don't have the bond. But you, I know you told me that I'll be able to download it, but I just don't know where to download it from. Uh, it's not a download. I think I sent you a new updated email this morning. Have you checked your email this morning? Yep. Okay, let me check. What I sent you, was what they made available to me. Okay, hold on. Let me check. Who's the email from? Uh, it should have come from support. Let me, what was your name again, and I'll go into the case and find it. Um. Okay, um, Emma, see the bond execution report and the notice to. What is it? Resend cancellation for your bond that was reinstated yesterday. Please let us know anything else needed. Yeah, let me go into the case here and I can explain what I sent you because that's what they opened up to me. Do you have your existing bond that was written last year? Yeah. Okay. The form that I included with this, the, hang on, let me get to it here. I'm in the wrong case. I apologize. This is Garage Motors Twenty Six LLC. Okay. Sorry, it's taking me a minute to get back to your account here. No worries. There we go, reinstatement of dealer bond. Okay. All right, the bond execution report. That should go along with your current bond. And kind of stand beside it as a continuance of the bond. Okay, so I will. I don't need. I don't need a new bond. No. Do DMV going to accept it? They they typically do. This is what what is generally typically generated. You don't get a new bond every year. Your existing bond if if it is paid continues for another year. So that's what this form is now. You know you should also take that. Resend where the cancellation of the bond was rescinded. Rescinded means it was scheduled to cancel due to nonpay, but that cancellation has been rescinded or canceled. Uh, so you could also take that form with you, but if you have your bond and then the bond execution form together. That should prove that your bond is still in force. Okay. But yeah, don't get a new bond every year. Right. Yeah, that this is what they are typically given from one year to the next. People don't normally get new bonds each year. Bonds are bonds are continued, and they usually present their bond continuing or continuance form or. Bond execution report, whatever they're called, different things by different companies, but but that's what you are to take with you to the DMV. Okay, because I I just normally used to do it in Florida. In Florida, they used to give us a new bond every year. So I just didn't know that. Yeah, you get you get execution forms or continuance forms, verification. I think travelers call theirs verification. But yeah, that's that's what you should take with you. Take your original bond and take that execution or verification form with you, and you should be fine. Okay, all right. Thank you. All right, you're welcome. Bye bye.
