Hello, this is Jeff. Can I help you? Hi Jeff, I'm calling because I wanted to renew the bond. Oh, okay, hang on one second. Let me get some information. Okay, who am I speaking with? Irma Ortiz. Okay, and what name is the bond? Under Garage Motors Twenty Six LLC. Give me the card. All right, hang on one second. Let me get it pulled up here for you. I think it expired in July. Okay, so. Looks like this would be. With auto owners, am I correct there? Alliance Insurance. Yeah, with auto owners. Yeah. Okay. Yep. All right. Let me go to auto owners and see what needs to be done. Okay, is this for an existing bond that you want to make a payment on, or are you needing a new bond written and issued for you? Um. This is an existing bond, uh, but it expired on July seventh. Okay. And I didn't realize that it was expiring. Gotcha, and I'm trying to find a bond number. I have it here. Yeah, I'll take it. Yep, I'll take. Six. Six. Four three zero four eight five. Okay, let me see if it comes up that way. I apologize, it's hard to find. All right. But let me plug this number in here and see if that helps. Okay, six six four three. Zero four eight five. All right. Correct. Okay, it shows canceled. Let me do this. I need to reach out to auto owners to see if I can accept payment or if it has to be rewritten. What's a good number that I can call you back at? Uh, three zero five. Three zero five. Seven six six. Seven six six. Three six four eight. Three six four eight. All right, give me just a minute. I'll reach out to auto owners and see what I need to do here, and I'll call you right back. All righty, thanks, thanks, Irma. Appreciate it. Bye bye.
