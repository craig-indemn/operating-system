Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Oh yes, hey, this is John Berger. I need to get a vehicle taken off one of our policies. We just added on. Okay. Have you turned in the tags for the vehicle? Oh, we never received tags. We were purchasing a vehicle, but then there was some issues with the purchase. Oh. The vehicle had some mechanical issues, so we're not we're not going to purchase it. But I went ahead and had insurance put on it, but just in case because we were expected to have it by now. Gotcha. All right. Well, let me get you an agent that can help. A thirty-one.
