Thanks for holding, it's Gary. Hi Gary, this is Deborah Risi. Um, how are you? I'm good. How about you? Doing well. Thank you. Okay, you are looking at our home insurance. We are. We're still working on that for you. Okay. I should be able to be back with you by the end of the week to try to get everything cleared up. Okay. All right. Yeah, so just give me a couple more days here, but we want to try to make sure that we check all boxes before we before we give you any numbers. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye.
