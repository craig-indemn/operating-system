Good morning. Thanks for calling Alliance Insurance, Mom. I hope you. Yes, ma'am. This is Jerry Mason. Do you own Kerry Haggerty Insurance? Give me one second just to double check that, okay. Okay. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, we do. You do. Yes. Okay. Uh, I got a quote. Not my insurance is due for November the tenth. I got four cars. I got two cars. I think kind of classic cars. There's two thousand one Corvette. Don't drive it. Probably less than one hundred miles a year. I got a ninety six SL five hundred Mercedes. I don't drive less than one hundred miles a year. Okay. I like to check on those two cars for insurance. That's a lot lower than what I've been paying. Okay. Give me one second. I can definitely connect over to an agent. I can look into that for you. Okay. All right. Give me one second. I'll transfer you over. Services. We appreciate your patience, and we will be with you shortly. While you wait.
