He's covered, I'm sure. Hello. Hi, this is JC calling back with Alliance Insurance. How are you doing today? I'm well. How are you? I'm doing good. Thank you so much for asking. We received your voicemail. You had a few questions about your auto insurance. How can I help you today? Well, I'm fairly certain I've already asked this question and it's already been answered. My daughter has a permit. And my understanding is that I don't need to get additional coverage for her yet with her as a driver, as long as she's with a licensed driver over the age of 21. Am I saying that correctly? So as far as the driving privileges, I'm not 100 percent sure on that. As far as insurance goes, is she listed on your policy already? Well, I think I, I think I, I think I asked them to go ahead and list her as a permit holder, but as I recall, I don't even. I was thinking they would say they said that that's not even really necessary or something like that. But could you just check it and tell me what we need to do? Absolutely. And if you don't mind, just confirming your address for me, please. Four one one seven Alonzo Drive, Winston Salem, North Carolina two seven one zero four. Thank you. Is it Rachel? Uh huh. It is. Okay. So she's on there already. Perfect. So we're good to go on that. So really, the premium isn't going to increase until she gets her driver's license. So you're good to go. Yeah, everything on your policy is good. Okay, and she's covered if something happens, right? Yes. Or I'm covered or the car is covered, whatever. Okay. All right. She's not your. Thank you. You're very welcome. Thanks. Bye bye. Bye.
