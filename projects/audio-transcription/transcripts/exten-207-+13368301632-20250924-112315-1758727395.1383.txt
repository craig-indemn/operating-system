Sorry for your hold. This is Cody. May help you. Hey Cody, it's Jennifer. Hey, how are you? I'm good. How are you? Good. Good. So um. That for that screenshot I sent you was that good enough? Because I didn't see the routing number on there. Yeah, it was down below. Okay, okay, gotcha. And then um. Okay, so is he going to be receiving some papers in the mail? He want to make double check. He will. Yeah, he'll receive the policy packets in the mail and everything. Um. I sent the certificate over. I guess you saw that right. Yes, I got that one. So he's installing now. I assume. Yeah, he's going to start today. Okay, good deal. And um, Jerry wants. Do you remember that car that we put on the policy? Oh no, we. So he wants it to be pulled out because he said that he went directly with Progressive and Progressive gave him insurance. Okay. Um, we can get that removed. I will. Think Brandy was the one that was handling that, so I will message her to remove that vehicle. Um, I think. Did he start that policy effective today? Uh, he started on Friday. He started on Friday. Yeah. Okay. Um, I will get that taken care of for him. Okay. Um and then yeah I will he should be receiving policy documents in the mail and everything in regards to that but yeah the policies will be automatically drafted from now on. Okay. Sounds good then. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you, Cody. Have a good one. You too. Bye.
