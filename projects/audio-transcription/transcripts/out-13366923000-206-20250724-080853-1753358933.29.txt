Hello, hey Neil, good morning Jeff Edmond. Jeff, what's happening man? Well, it's Thursday. We're creeping along. Not making much progress. We'll be finished live. We'll get started all over. That's right. Get do it all again next week. Hey, sorry to bother you. I thought I'd try to catch you first thing this morning. No, you're fine. I'm riding through your part of the country. Okay, where you heading? Anywhere decent. Hell no. Well, that's what I'm calling about is boomble. Isn't that funny? I was on vacation last week when you called. I apologize. No, that's fine. No problem at all. There's nothing urgent. Just trying to get started and give us time to do whatever we need to do. But what else is going to kind of get planted here? We've got the two wide storage solutions. Renewals coming up. One is August 30th. That is, these are both Woodruff roads. By the way, if I don't, I'm not as familiar with everything that we're working on here. I know we've got this 2509 Woodruff Road that renews August 30th. We've got 114 Woodruff Road, which renews a couple weeks after that. They're right across the street from each other. Awesome. Okay, is that pretty much all that's in that area, or are there other properties as well? No, no, I'm the bigger. I'm the biggest two buildings in boomble. Awesome. Okay, well, that we have gotten renewal indications from Westfield on both of these, and they're very similar in what they're looking to do. Both of them are looking to increase the building coverage. Pretty pretty big, and we can do some replacement cost evaluation on it to see if that's what we need to be doing. The one thing I wanted to ask you: has there been any roof updates on either one of these two properties? Yes. Okay, give me as much detail as you can, and if I need to email you this, I don't mind doing it at all. I know you're driving, and I don't know how much off top of your head you've got all this information. Well, I'm actually at 2509. They're supposed to be starting in about a feet thousand foot section of it. They're supposed to start about three weeks ago, but it's decided to rain every day. Oh yeah. Since I don't know. So, what kind of timetable do you think on that work? I mean, I might pull up over here today and they're starting. I don't know, but they were supposed to start about three weeks ago, and I've got a signed contract where I'm doing another feet thousand feet of it. How big are we talking? I should know that, but how big are we talking about? How big? What is the roof? How big is the roof section that we're talking about? I mean, the entire roof is what I should ask. Okay, the whole building is 240 thousand feet. And one of the sections, which is the only metal roof part of it, is 100 thousand feet. Okay, but it's it's less than 20 years old. And it is perfect. I want to say that today, and of course, something happens. But it is perfect. Knock on wood. Yeah, knock on wood. It is perfect. No problems. When in 2022, we replaced 60, 000 feet of TPO. Okay, and I'm doing another fifty thousand now, so that'll leave me with about I don't know 25, 000 to do. Yeah, well, you know when you when you got a building that big and you know even though Dean even though Dean's done very well for himself, he still break those those bills up in sections. Gotcha. Yep, understood. Well, that'll help. And the only reason I ask there, I don't think this this was part of either policy, but they're putting an endorsement on the policy that is basically going to exclude cosmetic damage. Don't think that's a big deal for you guys, but just if it's cosmetic for me, Jeff. Well, anything that is is appearance only. For example, if there's and I think this only pertains to wind and hail damage that might cause something like this. Let's just say that. And you know, without having a specific roof to cite, it's a little hard, but any sort of damage that is cosmetic only in nature that wouldn't be. You know damage to the I guess the. There's a word I'm trying to come up with, and I'm not coming up with
