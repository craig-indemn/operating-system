Hey Brenda, how are you? Oh hi, good on you. How did you know? I just saw the caller ID and said your name. Oh, okay, that makes sense. You doing okay today? Yes, I was just going to see if you had got any new coats back because I never got any emails and I figured I'd ask. I might have given you the wrong email. You're perfectly fine. I'm still waiting on my underwriter to approve them, Brenda. I'm hoping that will be sometime this afternoon or first thing in the morning. But as soon as I do, I will definitely give you a call. We can go over everything and get them started for you. Okay. Oh okay then, thank you. I know, sorry it's taken a little while. Sometimes underwriters have a lot going on, so sometimes it takes a while to get them back. It's all right. I was just like, oh my goodness, I better call now. Now I completely understand. I will be in touch as soon as possible. All right, thank you. Bye. You're welcome.
