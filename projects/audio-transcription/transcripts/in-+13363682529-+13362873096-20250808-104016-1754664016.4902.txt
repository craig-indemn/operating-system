Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hey, my name's Daniel Wilson. I just got a voice message from Christopher Cook. Tried to return that call, but he said to try Amani as well. I guess. Try Amani. Okay. Let me see. So Amani actually just stepped out. Can I just tell him to give you a callback? Yeah, yeah, you can tell whoever. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, the phone number three three six two eight seven three zero nine six. That's right. Perfect. I'll let him know. All right. Take it. You're welcome. Bye bye. Bye.
