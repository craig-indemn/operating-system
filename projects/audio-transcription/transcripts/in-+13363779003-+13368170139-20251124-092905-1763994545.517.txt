So he got everything reinstated, but then I got a letter in the mail. So I'm just wanting to make sure that everything's still correct. Okay, all right. Was this this morning or what has this been? No, it was it was it was at the end of October. Okay, is it for the auto policy? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so you just want to make sure that it's the policy reinstated and. Yeah, he told me that it was, but now that I got this letter, I just want to make sure. Okay, yeah, let me pull it up and I'll be happy to look at it. Who am I speaking with? Jeffrey Teague. All right, Jeffrey. Is the address four one five Joe Road? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so yeah, it shows it shows that the policy paid in full.
