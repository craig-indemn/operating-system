Good afternoon, good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. I hope you. Hi, yeah, it's not afternoon yet. I know you're gonna say that. Yeah. Um, I I got a bill in the mail. I want to make sure it's what I think it's for. Okay. For my renter's insurance. Okay, give me one second and get that. No problem. Okay, so um for the um it's telling me that you owe 88 with 50 cents for the first of December. Yeah, and that's their renter's insurance, right? Okay, that's what I wanted to know because I I wanted to make sure because I didn't see it incorporated with my uh my regular insurance. So I wanted to make sure that this was for their renter's insurance and not something that I didn't know. Okay, that's all I needed to know. Okay, is there anything else I can help you with today? Okay, and that was the lowest amount that we got. Right, there was nothing anything lower than that 88 or 174. Uh, Simania, was there anything cheaper? For that, I'd have to transfer it over to an agent that could give. Okay, don't worry about don't worry about. I think this was the cheapest one. But that's what I just okay. Yeah, I just want to make sure this was for their renter's insurance. Okay. All right, thank you so much. Okay, have a good day. Goodbye.
