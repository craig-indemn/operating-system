Mister Berino, this is Gary at Alliance Insurance. I called a couple days ago. Your homeowner's policy is getting ready to renew or I mean cancel, on October the sixth. The company that you had that coverage with is no longer operating in the state of North Carolina, so we are going to have to try and find new coverage for you if you have not already done so yourself. Please call me back to confirm and so I can gather some information. Number here is three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thank you.
