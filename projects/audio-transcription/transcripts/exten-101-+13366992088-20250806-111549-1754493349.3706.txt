Thank you for patiently holding. This is Amani speaking. Yes, hey Amani, this is Sherry at Camden Heating. How are you today? I'm doing great. How you doing? I'm doing good. Listen, I just want to tell you what I did here, okay? I got the invoice yesterday in the mail. I went on there to go through my bank to put it in, and so I tried to put it in the where it would go through and so you could get it by Friday. Well, it wouldn't let me go through until go through to August 13th. But I do have a confirmation number to let you know that. I tell you this postal service and stuff is getting crazy in this bank and stuff. So I do have it posted and it should be to y'all by the 13th. So I don't want no more hiccups with anything. So I'm trying to get it set up to where I can do it through through the bank. But I didn't get the bill until yesterday for whatever crazy reason, okay? Okay. Yeah, as long as this postmark before that date, there's no problem. And you know they always give a couple more days after. It's you know. Okay, all right. So it'll be okay. All right, I just wanted to make sure because I don't if anything comes through and you see it, please give me a call because I'll get right right on it, okay? Oh yeah, well we definitely keep an eye on it. All right, sounds good. You have a good day, okay. You too. Thanks for giving me a call. Uh huh. Bye bye.
