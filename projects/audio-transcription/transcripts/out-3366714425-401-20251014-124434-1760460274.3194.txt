I just wanted to reach out to you today to kind of do a review of your current policy, your homeowners insurance. That's with auto owners. I know we saw a little bit of a hike there for your premium renewal. Just looking also to see if we could talk about quitting your auto insurance. To try and bundle with your homeowners, that's definitely going to help offset that premium increase. So if you can, just give me a call back. Three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Again, it's Heather Scott with Alliance Insurance. Thanks, Lauren.
