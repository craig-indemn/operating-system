This is Rick. Hey Rick, this is Tony at Novum Underwriting. How are you? Hey, I'm good, Tony. How about you, buddy? I'm doing well, thanks. Janelle had shot me an email. Sorry, she's slammed today with a couple different things. So I wanted to give you a quick call here follow up on that select hospitality. Yeah, sure. Let me let me grab my. Just give me. I was actually looking at that file right this minute, so I probably am good to talk with you about it and work out whatever we need to work through here. So I think, if I'm repeating things, I apologize. I think we had originally calculated the ITV on that thing based on a full service hotel, and this is really not a full service property. It's definitely you know no restaurant or. You know, big you know it's just a limited service property. So I think one of the things we had asked you know would you guys be willing to amend that ITV on the quote I can't remember the number I needed maybe 4. 3 4. 4 million on the building. Okay. And and then I was just trying to be sure as I look over the proposal. There's some optional coverages I would like to include if we can equipment breakdown for sure, hired non owned automobile liability for sure, and if we can get it at least that basic property expansion that Excel offers if they'll if they'll give it to us. Okay. Yeah, I think is because I see him on there, so it should be good. Those will just need to go into that total premium there. To those are not already included. Yeah. No. Yep, I get it. I get it. And if and then I suspect if we if you guys are comfortable, you know lowering that ITV just a little to what I think to a more accurate level. You know, I'll offset some of that, probably all of it, and and we'd be able to to I don't know. I think we've got a good shot at this one. Where I'm not sure who we're competing with, Tony. I almost think he may be talking to Erie. They're still believe it or not, they're still writing hotels in North Carolina. Okay, but but I don't know, I don't know what their pricing's like. We don't represent them obviously, and so you know that's a little bit of a wild card that I I'm just not sure if he's talking to an Erie agent or not, but he could be. Okay. Yeah, I'll see. As he told, yeah, I mean he just said you don't have any pricing. He doesn't you don't know if he's got any anything else on the table. I don't think he does. I mean, I've known this guy for 20 years. You know, he he shoots straight with me about all the time. But when we know you know right now at least here and probably everywhere a new purchase hotel, it's just a tough risk, man. I mean, we don't have a lot. We have no standard markets in our agency, and we got a bunch of standard markets that will look at a hotel unless it's a bad gum, you know, 10 year old or less, you know, courtyard by Marriott or or you know something. Probably on the upper scale of things, and you know these these sort of these mid scale or budget properties like Quality Ends and and even Hampton Ends and things like that. Man, they're just really tough. So so if Sam Samir the owner here, you know he may have reached out to somebody. He hasn't said that to me, but you know he you know people tend to play things close to the vest. You know, and I don't I think he he may have, but but I don't think I don't think this number is bad here. I mean, my God, you know for what what we're looking at, it's not. I don't think it's out of out of out of being competitive unless unless a wild card like Erie snuck in there and just really undercut it. And I just don't know for sure if he's out there looking at. Okay. Yeah, let me kind of relay some of this to Janelle on the underwriting team here, see what we can do. And what do we got? Yeah, okay, looks like we still got a little bit of time. So yeah, we do. Probably won't see anything this week. No, it's on. Yeah, today's Friday. This one, this one's okay, man. I've got another one. I'm working with Ryan on this a little more time sensitive, but this one here. I've told Sam that it's going to be next week before we can nail things down. And
