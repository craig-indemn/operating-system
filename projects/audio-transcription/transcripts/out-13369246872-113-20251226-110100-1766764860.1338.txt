Hello. Hey, Mister Raber, it's Gary at Alliance Insurance. How are you? Okay, I was just checking to make sure I haven't gotten any billing for my insurance. Do you know when it's due and? I got a card and it says I'm covered from eleven something to twenty five to eleven something twenty. What company was that with, Mister Raber? Hold on. Okay. Okay, it's Cincinnati Casualty Company. Okay. And it says effective date twelve twenty eight of twenty five, expiration date twelve twenty eight of twenty six, but I haven't gotten any billing or anything. Okay, let me let me check into it and call you right back. Okay, okay, if you would please. I will. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. But.
