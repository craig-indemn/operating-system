Good morning. Calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Ah yes, I'd like to say my rent at insurance. Okay, let me get that pulled up for you. Give me one second. Alrighty, it's gonna be nineteen dollars and sixty-eight cents. Okay, I'll pair with my card. Is it the master card ending in zero five one zero or the checking ending in zero one nine? Master card ending in zero five one zero. That one. Yes. Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and that payment was already processed. Um, was there anything else I can help you with? No, I just want to make sure that's paid. Alrighty, it is paid. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Have a good one. You too. Bye.
