Lines Insurance Services. This is Maria. Yes, Maria. This is Christy Anderson. I'm calling. I just gave a vehicle of mine away, so it's been transferred to someone else. I need to remove it from my insurance policy. Sure, and I'm sorry. What was the name again? Christy Anderson. K R I S T I E. Okay. Okay, give me one second. I just have paid it, so I guess I'll get a credit back for that if I've already paid for the insurance and. Oh yeah, yeah. Okay. The account number is five four six zero nine seven six. Give me one second. Let me take a look. Looking at the wrong one. Give me one second. And it did have my husband's name Jesse Anderson on there, but I have sent in information he passed away to have his name removed, so it shouldn't be on there anymore. I'm so sorry for y'all. Thank you. Okay, which vehicle are we removing? The 1999 Amigo, Suzie Amigo. Okay. And when are we making that effective? Today. Today now. Yeah, he just has transferred the plate, turned it in, and it's just been done. The 1999 Amigo. Okay. They do show him. He's he was listed as first named insured on the policy, and that's the reason why it's still on there. We'd have to do a whole rewrite, which would be a little bit more complicated. They do show him as being deceased. Just wanted to let you know that. That's fine. Okay, we've got you taken care of. Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you very much. And like I said, and like I said, I just had sent in my payment for the whole amount, so they they'll just credit me back that. To go later on. Okay, all right. Just want to make sure. All right, thank you very much. You're welcome. Bye bye. Okay. Bye bye.
