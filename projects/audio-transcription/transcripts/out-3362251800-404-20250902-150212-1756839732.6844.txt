Oh yeah, my wife said she paid that online today or this morning or something. Yeah, because I yeah, because she's all up with that online stuff and I was, had all my information to give you, but she said just pay it and I said okay fine pay it. Well, that's wonderful. If you can just double check, make sure that it showed is paid. Yes, sir. I will give them a call and see. Sounds great. All right. You have a wonderful day. You too. Bye. Bye.
