Hello. Hi, this is Kendall with Alliance Insurance. Messy with James. You speaking with me. Okay, I wanted to give you a call for Anna. She was out of the office today, and she had mentioned I think she emailed you over a statement of no loss that needed to be signed today, in order for a policy to be reinstated. So I just want to make sure that you got that and that we could get it signed today. Honey, I've been in I've been out of town for a couple days. Okay. And I I did get it, but I I don't have a computer on me, and so I was going to pull it up tomorrow and and take a look at that and and check it out. Okay. I just didn't know what to say about it. I mean, I just there's nothing I can do at this at that time. There's no loss. I'm gonna tell you that. Okay, yeah, they just have to have that signed document to reinstate it. She said it had to be done today. Are you able to do it through your phone? I don't know how to do it through my phone. Okay. That's what the problem is. I I'm not a very computer savvy person. I had to get back to get back to here. I'm here, and I was going to take a look at in the morning and try to take care of whatever it is. But. Okay, well I will let her know that and see if she can reach out to the underwriter. Okay, I'm in the construction industry and I'm I'm not at a place most of the time. There's there's no computers. It's dirt work, I guess you'd say. I understand. So I'm in a rough environment, and I don't have a computer with the vehicle and all that kind of stuff. And I'm not a savvy of most of that the techniques. But I was going to get back with her tomorrow. I should um. Okay. Finally, I'm at home. So now tomorrow morning I'm just going to take a look at and send that. Is that a problem? I mean, what do I need to do? Well, I'm not you know too familiar with your account. Normally Anna is the one that handles that, but she was out of the office today. So she just asked if I would give you a call just to see if you were able to go ahead and sign it. Okay. I'll let her know what you told me and see if she can work something out with the underwriter. Okay, that that would be great. I just I I deal with a lot of emergency calls. So it's a harsh environment once it becomes a emergency call and I can't take the time to do that. I didn't know that was going to happen. I did get the email, saw it or text or whatever it was. It's it's definitely my fault. And I'll be glad to sign it, but I just. Okay, well I'll let her know, and then she can get in touch with the carrier and then go from there. Okay, I will just sign it as soon as we're able to. I appreciate that. All right, thank you. Have a good evening. All right, thank you. You too. Thanks, bye. Bye.
