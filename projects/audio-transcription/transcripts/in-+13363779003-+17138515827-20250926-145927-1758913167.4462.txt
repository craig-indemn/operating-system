Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hi, my name is Hannah. I um, I'm purchasing a home in Winston Salem and looking to get a quote on home insurance. I was just speaking with Progressive because we live in Arizona now and we use them, but they're not able to. Um, service the area, so they actually gave me the phone number of you guys for a local agent. Okay, it is is the is the property in Arizona or or you just live there. We just live here, but we're moving there in a in a month, so we're closing on a home in Winston Salem in a couple weeks. So. Oh, that's exciting. Yeah. It's a lot different over here than Arizona. Yeah, yeah. The reason why I say that is because I went to Arizona um a couple of months ago and there's no grass over there. I know it's funny. It's there's grass here. We have grass growing through the concrete. Lots of grass and trees there. I'm excited about the trees though. Yeah, yeah, well, good, good. Um, well, let me put you on hold and um, and we'll get an agent to help you out with that. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance Services. We appreciate your patience. Are you still with me? Yes. Okay, I hit the wrong button. Let's try this again. Questions and we will be with you shortly.
