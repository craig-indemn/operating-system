Hey Jesus, how are you? Good, how are you? I am good. I got a request from Alex over at Custom Built Structures to add you as a driver on one of their policies. Yeah, I am going to move. I am going to that's what I was going to call you. I was going to call you today. I didn't know if you were free or not, and I didn't know how your schedule was. Uh huh. Because I am going to go ahead and move. I am going to move companies because they gave me a better offer than Longhorn did, and they're providing actually providing the truck and trailer for me. So that's why I was going to just move with them and they. Willing to provide a lot more. Cancel the policies that we just started. I guess so. Yeah, that's what because they're they're going to put me, they're going to give me deals and all that because I can I am going to have a trip by them. Right. Do you have a personal auto policy? Yeah. Who's it through? What is it called? Like the actual insurance company, not the agency that you go to. I think it's Allstate. Allstate. I think I know it's CMS Insurance, for a fact, but I don't know exactly who's whole problem. CMS Insurance, where is that at Elkton? Yes, sir, and Yakindu, but I go to the one in Elkton. Oh, yeah, they've got a whole bunch of companies. But you think that you are with Allstate? Yeah, I am pretty sure. Because I am adding you to their policy as a driver, and so they are probably going to ask for a copy of it. Yeah. Well, I don't have a car in my name, but that's who I go with. I go with CMS Insurance. All my cars. I actually have a policy in your name. No, I don't. I don't have one in my name. All my cars are in my in my wife's name. But are you listed as a driver on her policy? No. You are not listed as a driver as her husband. No, I am not. I am not on her insurance. I am just I just see insurance of the cars and has them in her name. It's because of what's going on with with me and. I understand that the cars are titled in her name, correct. Uh huh. But are you listed as a driver on her policy? Because she's your wife, right? Yes, but I am not on. I am not on anything because of the reason being because I have my name completely out of everything because of what's going on with me, my situation with my baby mama and child support. I've. We've had three. I've got to the point where I had to put everything out of my name. I am not even on no insurance. I have no insurance. The vehicles aren't titled to you, but you should still you are driving the vehicles on the policy. You are married to her, and legally you are supposed you are supposed to be on that policy as a driver. That has nothing to do with whatever you know. Stuff you have going on with your baby mama. So because I don't know this may be an issue if I can't show that you are like you have a personal auto policy. Do you understand? Uh huh. You should be added to her policy as a driver, is what I am telling you basically. And that has nothing to do with the ownership of the vehicles or anything like that. You are driving the vehicles on the policy, correct? Yes. But right now I am right now we she has one car in her name which is my other car but I don't drive it I drive a car that my uncle gave because the car she does have in her name it broke down so we borrowed a car from my uncle I am just borrowing the car from my uncle for another month and that's it but she's the one driving it I drive a different truck my work truck that I've been renting out like for me to start this group. Got you. So technically, I am not driving none of her cars right now. I've been driving the work truck, but that's in somebody else's name. Lord, I just saw your motor vehicle record, buddy. Uh huh. You got a lot of tickets in the last couple years, haven't you? Uh yeah, like I said, I don't. It's because of I had a fast car and fast cars got me in trouble, so I don't have a fast car anymore for that reason. Is your license suspended right now? No, it shouldn't be. I think it is, buddy. No, because I figured all that out with the courts and not all that been paid. I've done paid all my tickets, everything that I've I
