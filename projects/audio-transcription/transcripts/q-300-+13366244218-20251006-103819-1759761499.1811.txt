Thank you for holding. This is JC. How may I help you? Oh yes, I was just like to confirm that my insurances are all up to date. Okay. May I have your name, please? Yes, my name is Peggy Folk or Margaret Folk, F O L K. I got a notice from Westfield, the homeowners insurance, which gave me some concerns. Okay. Let me just pull up your account and we'll take a look at it here. Okay. If you don't mind, just confirming your address for me, please. Sure, it's seven thirty-six Hardy Road, Salum, North Carolina two seven zero four seven. Thank you very much. And let me see. And what specific policy is this for? As a homeowners. Homeowners policy. Do you have that policy number handy? I don't. Okay. Can look it up, but I don't have it. No, let me just. It's going to probably take me a little bit longer to find it, but that's okay. It's a farm, so I know we've had several different policies. Okay, and is that the one that you received the notice on? Westfield, yes. Okay. And the policy is it under John A. Folk. Yes. Okay. Yes, that's awesome. I don't know that I'm going to have access to it. Let me try. Because it is under a farm policy. Okay, I know we arranged it. The you guys. Right. Yes, it's just that I work with. Just regular home and auto, and then. Farm would be considered more on the commercial end. We have a specific representative. It's a farm, but it's not a working farm. Oh right, but still the we have a specific representative who helps with that. That's why I'm saying I don't know that I'll. Have access to that. Okay. And what was what exactly did the notice say? I can have her take a look at it if you just let me know your concerns. I will put you on speaker. Okay. And then switch over. Because I did take a screenshot of it. Hold on. It said policy alert, policy expired. This policy has expired and we do not have sufficient or updated evidence. That you have obtained new coverage. Okay, so I'm looking at the information we have in our system and it looks like Addison. Is in contact with John and she said in the email I have submitted proof of insurance to mycoverageinformation.com. They will notify me if they need anything else. I have also attached copies for your review. And that was. Okay. Today a few minutes ago actually. Oh interesting. But it was to Westfield, right? This was to mycoverageinformation.com and I'm assuming Westfield uses that same site to have. Yeah, they do. Okay. Sent in, yeah. So we we've sent it in already. We're just waiting for confirmation from them. So it looks like John has taken care of that and Addison assisted assisted with that. Good and then the other thing is while I'm at it, I just want to make sure that. The insurance on the truck is up to date. Okay. Yeah, let me take a look at that for you. Was it for that twenty sixteen RAM? Yeah. Looks like the policy renewed back in July. Yeah, that would be nice. I don't see any outstanding balances. It looks like it was paid in full. Back in July. Good. Good. And there aren't any other vehicles on our policy, right? It is just that RAM. Okay. Twenty sixteen RAM twenty five hundred. Right. That's it. Okay. I just want to make sure we're all squared away. Yeah, no, I completely. You don't want to be out of. Yeah, we don't want to be out of either of those. I understand. Yes. Right. Okay. And what was your name again? JC. I don't. Yeah, never talked with you before. Okay. Great. Okay. Yeah, thank you for your. Absolutely no problem. It was my pleasure. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, Margaret. Yes, I will now. Okay. Good. Have a good one. Bye. Thanks. Bye.
