Hello. Hey, Chassidy, it's Heather with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Hey Heather, how are you? Doing good. So I wanted to get back with you on that twenty-six dollar check. I called AO and they did advise that that was like two ish days worth of premium, from where we canceled on the twenty fifth. So you are good to cash that. Okay. All right. I just wanted to make sure before I do anything. Yeah, and I think it was just the way that the billing looked. Even on my end, it just appeared to be off. So I just wanted to call as well. So if you do have any questions, just let us know. Okay. Awesome. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Yes, no problem. Have a good day. You too. Bye bye.
