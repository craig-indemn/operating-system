Thank you, Paul. Hey, CC, it's Jacob Cummings from Cyber Gear. How are you? Hey there, Jacob. I'm good. How are you? I'm good. I got a ticket with Morgan Campbell. She has. She let us know that she had an issue with Adobe, and it seems like that issue has rectified itself. But she also has the question of seemingly I don't know how recent. But that her Adobe was either downgraded to from the subscription or otherwise I don't know. What may have happened? And I don't remember how you all manage your Adobe licensing internally. And just wanted to check with you on that. Okay, so Morgan reached out and said that her Adobe has been downgraded somehow. Yeah, she she is currently her when she signed into her Adobe account associated with her Alliance Insurance email. It does not have a license. So we don't have an agency wide license for Adobe. We'll reach out to her, Jacob, and let her know that that's not the case. But since I have you on the phone, and you called. I don't know if you you should be able to. I think you helped me in the past. But they remember that can't print when she is accessing a company site. It's just one company that she goes in and you know does whatever and then she needs to print a document and then the the printer won't show up. Okay. Look at her and see what's going on. Sure, who is it? Your computer. You said that your computer doesn't print. Oh, so I've got Jacob here. I'm gonna leave you with her for a moment and I'll be right back. It's Brandy by the way. Hey Jacob. Hey, let me find your computer here. Do you want me to pull up NC Green so I can show you what it is? Once I get remoteed in, yes. Okay. I'll go ahead and get logged in. I should be able to find you here. Are you at the Clemens office or? No, no, the Winston office. My. Okay. Gotcha. One one two. Gotcha. Let's see if that wins yet. This one should be it. Let's see. You see me remoteed in up at the top. Uh yes. Perfect. Guess right. Alright. Yeah, let's go ahead and take a look. Okay. All right. Well, okay, taken forever. What in the world? Okay, I mean, log out and log back in. I mean, the site is slow, but not that slow. Oh my gosh, what is going on? Alright, thank you. So. I'll just do this one. So whenever I get down to the end over here and I go to print the app, this is what happens. Well, of course that one isn't going to work. That's not a good example. Somebody didn't finish that application. I'm gonna say I'll get quote in a impression check the bathroom code. We're good on TV. For at least another two weeks. Oh my gosh. Get it together, woman! It's NC Green. It's not me. No, they're not perfect. So you have your own. I think Addison does. She doesn't have hers. Casey doesn't apparently either. Casey. Tracy. See how can you do everything in NC Green. Okay, I'll make sure all personal lines. Is he in? Yeah, you like this. Candy. Actually, unless you like. No, I should order this. No, you gotta go check it out. Okay, I'm gonna pick the quote this time that I know I do. No, the Nita McClure. This one. Is all the questions answered? It will not know. See, let me let me do mine. This one. Where is that? Where is that? Alfonso, you should be able to. It's just a quote. We haven't converted to an application yet. I. Which one? Alfonso. The quote. It's just a quote. And it'll pull up like this box up here. This thing, yeah, and then it does this, and I can't. I can't print nothing. And every other computer can. What's my login? Yes. Hey, I've seen the house here. I said I've seen the house. What's the code? It's a waste word. Probably driven by. Never been saying I probably worked on it before it looked familiar. I'm trying to wonder why. Yeah, they answered something or didn't answer or. I don't think so. I think it's just. That could be it. One of them is over three years. The other one was. You got a different question. I mean. Which uh which printer do we want to print to? Ssq or personal line? Canon, I think is
