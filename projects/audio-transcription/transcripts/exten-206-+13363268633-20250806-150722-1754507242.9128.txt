Hello, this is Jeff. Can I help you? Hey Jeff, my name is Jennifer Brock. I'm with the Plummer LLC. Yeah, good afternoon. How are you? I'm doing all right. My husband is trying to buy a new vehicle for his company. And we are wanting to transfer or remove one vehicle from insurance, take that tag and transfer it to. This new vehicle. Sure. All right, give me one second. Get you pulled up here. All right, you guys are with Auto Owners. Let me go in here. We get this knocked out right quick. Is this happening today? Yes. Okay. Actually, I submitted a request a couple days ago because I thought we were buying one that day, and it turned out that we didn't. Oh. Right, dog, really. Which vehicle are you? Transfer and off. Um. I am not. Let me. Let me just verify. And since we're doing this today, I'm going to go ahead and just complete this while we are on the phone here. All right, policy action. Do I have a 2012 Chevrolet van or a 2013 Chevrolet van? I apologize. I know if that was four vehicles on the policy. Yeah, there are four. I switch screens, so we are replacing a vehicle. All right, you have a 2013 Chevy Express G2500, 2023 Chevy Silverado 2021 Chevy Silverado, and a 2017 GM 3500. Okay, yes, it's the 2013 van. Okay, the Express. All right. Okay, and can you give me the VIN number of the new vehicle? Yes. That is going to be. One G C W G F C. F is in Frank or S is in Sam. I'm sorry, F is in Frank. That's okay. And then C is in Cat, A is in Apple, the number eight, E is an elephant, number one nine one. Five two eight seven. Okay, one G girl C cat W G girl F Frank C cat A, the number eight, E is an Edward one nine one five two eight seven. Yes. All right, that should be a 2014 Chevy Express 2500. That's right. Okay. Perfect. Uh, no changes in coverage. You've got a comp deductible of a thousand dollars. There was no collision coverage on the other vehicle, and there's also towing coverage up to a hundred dollars. Okay, I need to make sure I need to find out from him if this is full coverage or not, as in that there is a lien. I apologize. Yep, if there's a lien, there probably yeah, that's no problem. Not quite sure what he is. Do you need to call me back or I can hold? There's no. Um, though if you just will bear with me, I'll text him now as we speak. Because I'm actually thinking it probably is full coverage. Is this completely business use or is it business and personal? I know this is completely business. Okay. Do you have time to give me that VIN number again? What if our print it went completely away? Okay, and this is not this has no lien, so just the same coverages as. What the other one had. Yes. Okay, sorry about that. I don't know what I hit, but the VIN that I put in there went away. So. Okay, that new that van is. One G is in girl, C is in cat, W G is in girl, F is in Frank, C is in cat, A. Number eight, E is an Edward, number one nine one. Five two eight seven. Perfect. 2014 Chevy Express, got it. All right. And we said midpay comp with a thousand deductible, no collision towing with a hundred limit. And everything else is just like the other one. Okay. Sounds good. Okay, I think I'm good. If you want me to, I will email you a proof of insurance so you can go ahead and have it. The picture I've got your. Yeah, because they're gonna want that.
