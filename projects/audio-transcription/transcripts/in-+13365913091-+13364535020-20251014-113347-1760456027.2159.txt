Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Yes, ma'am. My name is Jimmy Cardwell. I'm calling with Farm Bureau Insurance. I have Helen Green on the phone. She's the grandmother of Sage Stovall. Okay. Yes, we just Helen. Do you want to speak because she knows you're here with me? Yes. Policy is in Shannon Green. As Sage Stovall. We need a declaration of insurance so they don't charge me with Farm Bureau for her insurance. Yeah, Sage's address matches Helen, so Farm Bureau's want to put her on the policy because the DMV has linked those addresses up. Could you send me over a declaration page that just shows Sage is listed as a driver so that I can remove her from Helen's policy. Yeah. Do you have the policy number by chance? You know what? It's two zero zero four eight eight nine zero seven one. With National Generals. Alrighty, I'll get that declaration page sent over shortly. Does it need to be? Yeah, I will say. Can you see it's my email? Yeah. Honestly, one second. What is your email? Because my email's long and complicated. It was. Okay. Mine is Ashley A S H L E Y. E as in Peter.
