Good afternoon, this is Jeremy. Hello. Hi Jeremy, this is. Yes, hi. Hi there. So Heather was telling me you had some questions about life insurance. Is that correct? Yes, yes, yes, sir. Okay. What's uh, what are you looking for? Tell me a little bit about that. Yeah, because I meet some I had a a quote from a different company, but there are there is two kinds the the term and the permanent. Is that right? Yes. So the which one do you guys offer? Both. Yep. Okay. How much is the yes how much is the um the term how many years? Depends on your age. If you're before age if you're not 50 yet, then you can have up to 30 years. No, I'm 64. Okay, so you would call 10 year term would be the maximum we can get you on the term side. No, I got an offer for more than that. Let me double check. 20, 25. Uh. Let's see. All right. So. I'm typing in some stuff here, so bear with me, please. Can you tell me your date of birth, please? May 17, 61. I think you have all the information in good my insurance. Right, that's right. She did mention that you were with another company. All right. Um. Let's see, any health issues or you use tobacco smoke. No, no, no, no. I'm diabetic with no insurance. Okay, so type two. All right. And what dollar amount are you looking for? Um. The pay in one. No, uh, how much coverage are you looking for? Oh, you give me the numbers that you have so I can choose. I mean, I can put in anything. I can put in that you want a million dollars. I can put in that you want 500, 000 dollars for your beneficiary. How much? How much is a hundred? How much is the monthly payment for a hundred? Hundred thousand. What's the minimum? What's the minimum? What's the minimum that they can? The okay. Like for 40 years, like 40 years. All right, so that would be the 100, 000 like you had said. So I'm running that right now to tell you kind of what we'd be looking at. So, for if everything came back as approved in the sense of your your health was good. And that it could be as low as 814 dollars for the year. Eight hundred dollars. Eight hundred fourteen dollars for the year. So you. How much is the monthly? Let me divide it here on the calculator and I'll be able to tell you. Be about 68 dollars a month. Oh no, that's too much. What about? Um, we said um, said hundred. Said hundred thousand. That is for 100, 000. That is the cheapest and the lowest that we could offer. So nothing less than 100. You saying? For 100, 000, no, you can't do a term policy for less than 100, 000. Unless you were just looking just to have just enough to get buried, if you will. Um, and then that that could be an option for you, but it would only be like 10, 000 dollars. No, I got more than that. I got offer for more than that. What about fifty thousand? Uh, we can't do term for fifty thousand. 100, 000 is the lowest that they offer on the term with our with the company that we have here, and I'll make sure that they won't let me change it. Okay, twenty. So how many the term? Twenty, how many years they give? Twenty, thirty, so how many? For the term. That was for 20 years. That was the maximum amount of time that the company would offer you. So the 20 years you said, how much 100, 000. Yep, 20 years be 100, 000 be 68 dollars a month. Oh, that's too much. Okay. Yeah, that's all that we have though available. So are you the broker or the company? You're the broker. Correct. Yeah, looking at the the companies that we have available, that's the the best rate that you can get for that dollar amount. Guaranteed. Well, if I don't want a hundred less than a hundred. Then you would have to do whole life, which would be permanent, and that'll be more expensive. If you wanted to do just 50
