The well actually make sure it's your home address. It's the 2341 Ravenhill Drive. Yes. Okay, and then they will send you an email. For you to confirm that you do want the auto pay and you'll have like I think, 24 to 48 hours to. Approve that if not we have to resend it again. Okay, so I just have to go on their system again and. It's supposed to come in as an email. Yeah, it comes in over as an email. From travelers. And if not, I do know you can create a portal and set the auto pay up through there, but that is more steps.
