Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Life Insurance. Hola, si buenas tardes. I don't have anyone at the moment that speaks Spanish. I can get someone to call you back if that's okay. Oh, great. Or did they call you back today? Have you had to? Oh, you did. Okay, let me look here. Let me look. Oh, okay. So it looks like JC tried to call. Okay. Yeah, give me one moment. Let me see if I can get her for you. Alright.
