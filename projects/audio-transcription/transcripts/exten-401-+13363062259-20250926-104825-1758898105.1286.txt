Thank you for calling. This is Heather. Hi, Heather. This is Henry Rory. How you doing? Hey. Is your ears burning? Oh, okay, all right. Oh my god. I forgot to call you. Oh god, that's wrong. Okay. So did you get my email, hon? I did. I did. Okay. Yeah. So we got a couple things that we got to get resolved, and that's who I was just talking to the underwriter at Northwest Farmers. She just called me, and she's concerned because. So the first thing is the premium increase. Are you okay with that? It did go up one hundred and fifteen dollars. Unless. Yeah. I don't know if it's so that's based on an insurance score that they pull and it's it was like a no hit on your credit and so that means they didn't they wasn't able to pull anything like. I think I probably explain that in the email, but like you know sometimes it's a no hit if if you don't have credit at all really any credit just a couple things there so. Does it sound like it would be a mistake? If would you want to give us your social security number to run it or or are you okay with the one fifteen increase on that? Yeah, that'll be fine. The one fifteen be okay. Okay, now sometimes like I said, if we, I know I have one person, think they have just, I don't know if they was trying to get a homeowner's loan or something, but anyway, it really. Hit their credit hard and so, they had a freeze on it. Maybe they have no that it was the freeze. Some people will freeze their accounts so people can't pull their scores. Right. I'm not sure what what what what what it was with that. Yeah. Okay, all right. Well, as long as you're okay with the increase. Now the second thing is your insurance carrier. They're wanting to make sure that you were you have insurance prior to this. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. I got it right here. Okay, I got who I got right now with with my house.
