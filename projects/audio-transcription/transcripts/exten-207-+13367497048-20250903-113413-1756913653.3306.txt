Hello, hello, it's Cody. Yes, it is. Hey, Cody, it's George. Hey George, how are you, sir? Hey, quick question. I'm doing fine. Just I just had a question for you. If you have a minute. Okay. I couldn't remember if I had how many crews I had on my policy. Because I only have one crew right now. I couldn't remember if we did have two or not. I'm pretty sure we just have one on there, George. Let me just. Because I only had one for like I mean only had two for like maybe a week or so. And it wasn't even that just they just dropped off the trailer they didn't even do the job. Just a second here. And this is under A1, right? Yes, sir. I don't think we had ever actually changed that, had we. I couldn't remember to be honest. And also had a question with the billing question. I would I wasn't aware if it was monthly or bi monthly. On your bills. Yeah. They should just be monthly. I don't think. Because they they took a one time payment of almost 3, 600. It was 3296. As what was taken out of my account, so that's what I was. I don't know if they took the other monthly payment on it or was it too. Let me check. We might have made the change. That's what I'm trying to figure out here. It's taking me a minute to get logged in here. Sounds like it was a double bill to me, to be honest. Yeah, that's what I was thinking because it was. I'm waiting for it to pull up here so I can go into it and look. It's being very slow. Yeah, 3, 200. That's that's pretty much exactly what a a double bill would be. Yeah. You know each of your policies two. It's on each. It should be about 32. I would say. Yeah, I I think that's the way it was. I'm waiting to see here. Yeah, 329206 was drafted on 828. And I bet it's because remember we did that that reinstatement. And so I bet that's what they had to do to get it caught up. Is why they probably didn't have time to bill for. July. Because that's when we did that we did that reinstatement. Yeah, towards the end of July, and so they probably didn't have time to bill for that and so they double billed because your remaining installment each month is 165083. And that's for your July, excuse me, your September 28, October 28, November 28, December 28, and January 28. So that's your remaining amount. So 165083. So that 3292 was getting you caught up from where we did that reinstatement. Okay. Does that make sense? Yeah. But yeah, I don't think that we ever. Let me get to the workers' comp policy here. Yeah, I just wanted to make sure. And I also have a new update phone number for you. Whenever you have a chance. You got a new phone number. Okay, is that the one that you're calling from? Yeah, the seven four nine seven zero four eight. All right. Let me. Seven four nine seven zero four eight. All right, I'll get that updated system. And I was trying to look to see. Are you running three helpers under you? Two. Two. Okay, so right now we have 239, 300 in payroll. I think it's going to be a lot less. They're making about maybe 1300 a week, 1400 a week right now. You said about what you said about 13, 1400. Yeah. Say 1400. 1400 each. Yeah. So that's about 72. What is it called? Like 73, 000 times 245, 000 plus you being included. I mean. We're not even we're not going out of state no more. We're just doing local runs and there's small runs. Right. Which. Where you're going is honestly irrelevant to the. Okay. The payroll. Yeah. So about 145, 000 for them plus you being included puts you about. Almost 210, 000 in payroll. Okay. So we got 239 on it right now. We can adjust it if you want to, or basically whenever you do your audit, you would just get a refund back whenever you submit all your
