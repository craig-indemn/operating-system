Hello. Hey Maggie, it's Jessica. Hey, um, I was calling you um, to ask you. Um, you think it will be a problem because it's under Miguel's name. The vehicles. No, it's just that um. Since uh, if he were to drive the vehicle, he just would need to be very careful not to have an accident because he's not listed as a driver. Oh cool. Like to take out like the. To like renew like the what about the the oh the placard yeah that would be fine. Oh it doesn't. Okay. Okay, um yeah so can we just go ahead and get it then. Yeah. Um. Are you gonna just set this up on auto pay. Uh no. So you're just gonna um make a payment online every month. Yes. Okay. Uh, give me. Okay, when you're ready, I can take the card number. It's five one four six. One six zero one. Five eight eight seven. One five three nine. Expiration. Zero nine twenty eight. And the two numbers in the back. Nine seventy three. Okay, uh, let me get that started and I'll send you an email. Um. Where to sign the application and then the ID cards as well. And then, the are they on a insurance policy right now or do they have like a lapse in coverage. Um, I think it's just already going to be um canceled tomorrow. Oh okay. Yeah. Okay, well that's fine. Um, if you are you gonna go right. Oh wait, sorry one question. Were you okay with the liability on the town and country. Uh, what is that? Liability is just that if it hits another car, it's going to be covered, but not that car itself, because other ones have full coverage. I just put liability on that one because it was an older car, so I assume that you didn't want any, but I don't want to ask. I guess that's fine. I'm not sure. Yeah, I guess. Do you have that car insured right now? Do you know if you have full coverage on it. Um. Yeah, my mom has it insured, but I'm not sure she has full coverage or not. Okay, well I guess you can ask her to make sure. Could I still change it or would it be a little bit more? Yeah, it'll be more if you put full coverage on it. You can always add it. We just need pictures of the car. Um. Okay, I think that's sorry. I think that's all that I needed right now. I'm gonna go ahead and get it started. Okay. Okay, that's fine. Any questions for me right now. No, no, because I know the other one takes a while for it to get here, and for you to get a quote. Oh yeah, I'm still working on that one. Um, I have to. We will need lost runs. Hopefully, if the agent can get you those. If not, we're gonna have to find another way to order them. Okay, um, I can try to see if he answers because I've been trying to call him and he doesn't answer. But I'll try to call him and ask. Okay, sounds good. Okay. Thank you. Thanks.
