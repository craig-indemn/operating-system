Hello, Heather. Hello, is this Heather? Hello, this is Heather. Heather Scott. Hey, this is Mike. Oh Mike, hey, I just called. I just sent you a voice or an email to. Good deal. Okay, how's it going? Pretty good. How about you? Good, good. It's been a busy week, that's for sure. So I'm glad I have nothing scheduled all day today. I had a schedule to call you at 10. Of course, somebody had called in. So I was on the call and trying to get that one wrapped up, but it feels good to have a day where I don't have any meetings scheduled or appointments. Like yesterday, I'm involved with the chamber, the Davie County Chamber. I'm an advisor, and we had a ribbon cutting and then we met. I met Alliance. The 11th from Alliance met with the Winston Salem Mortgage Lenders Association yesterday as well. So it's just been one of those weeks. And then of course we have Veterans Day and we're closed for that and have team building. So it's been a lot this week. So, but let's talk about yours. I'm just pulling them up now and auto owners. So did you finally get the one that I sent it again yesterday? Switching on Boulevard. Yeah, I did get that. Came down a little bit by switching it out. Let's see which one do you want to start with first? I thought I'm all pulled up here. So. Since the largest increase was from my my primary residence at Cross Creek Trail. Okay. This one that went up the most. I mean, I have to say I'm pretty. I'm pretty frustrated that we went through the whole process last year and if you. I mean, my biggest concern was since I know the way insurance companies do is I did not want to get a first year rate to make me switch and then. To jack it up, and you assured me that's not what would happen, and that's in the looks like exactly what happened with auto owners. So it's not auto owners. It's across the board. All the carriers. This is happening to everyone. It's a statewide rate change. And that's where the North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance comes in at. So if you if you're able to see on your renewal that should. List out what changed. I don't know if you're able to see that you should be able to. But I can let you know like what changed on the. Your primary was coverage A went from six hundred sixty six thousand five hundred to. Now they're saying to replace your home it's going to cost seven hundred and forty four thousand. So all those coverages increased, John or Mike. I'm sorry. That's what I just got off the phone. Well, it's John. Yes, that's that's where you're seeing the the significant increase. I guess that accounts for like what is that increase about fifteen percent in value. Ten sixty six sixty five seven forty four yeah. And again, so the coverages below that because all those coverages below that is a percentage of your dwelling. So everything all the coverages went up. It's not just you're not seeing just the premium. And I want to make that clear. I want you to understand that, but they're just not auto owners. Isn't just jacking the rate up. It's what they're saying. I see that, but that that that only counts for like fifteen percent of it. I mean, I see the math on that. I can do the math. I'm an actuary. Understand you should get a pro rate increase. Coverage goes up fifteen percent. Premium should go up fifteen percent. But to go up forty two percent. There is some a lot going on and. So how much is the state? What they don't break it down on that. I mean, besides that coverage. So how much were just the state wide statewide rates? What did they go up across the board? Oh gosh, I can't remember if it was fourteen. It was like fourteen. I want to say fourteen percent. I'm not exact on that, but yes, they do that every every year it gets voted. And like I said, we have no control over it. The carriers don't have control over it. It's just the state and that's what it's saying on here statewide rate increase. Along with the course the replacement cost. So. Yeah, I mean that's kind of what I wanted when I said I wanted to break down. I mean that's kind of what I need to know is like I'm a detailed person and I want to see. What percent each of these things has happened and to understand what does that even mean? What insurance score tier increase? What is is that? Don't that my insurance? I mean, like my score personally went to Yeah, I think that. I think that is probably what I need to do is go to. Five thousand. You want to do five thousand all perils or you want to split it? I can I can play around with. I'll let you know what all perils are five thousand. Yeah. So that decreases a bit. Yeah, if we do five thousand, it takes off three hundred and forty. Three hundred and forty nine dollars. Yeah, I guess is there any peril like if you do it on the main thing like fire. Yeah. Is there a reason to have a lower one on something that like the. Sewer backup or something like that that would or which ones could you have? That maybe you know lead to a lower claim where you might want to have a lower deductible. So. I was trying to see what your water backup did. I thought it was twenty five hundred. Twenty five thousand it should be or fifty. What the country is. Did you tell me you have a central alarm? Do you have some? I just got local alarms on here. Yeah, local. Yeah, I don't have it monitored. Okay. I'm just trying to see where we could help. Oh my gosh. Yeah, there's twenty five thousand water backup, but now those all other perils would you know you can only do like either. A flat deductible for all perils or. Um split between all other perils or and wind and hail. Okay, so the only thing you can break off is the wind and hail. But yeah, if you went to. Five thousand twenty five hundred to five thousand all perils. Then it it saves off three hundred and forty nine dollars. Okay. I think. Twenty five hundred for everything. That's your renewal, right? What was your? It was eighteen. I mean that wasn't changing the renewal. I think it was no it was. I think it was twenty five hundred. I mean you just kept everything the same as last year. I didn't change the changes. Right, right. No, I'm just walking through it now. I'm just giving you some options. But your premium last year on this property was eighteen. If I eighteen three, what that was. Yeah. So if we bump you up to five thousand. On this property, you're down to twenty two oh eight. Yeah, I think. That's what I want. I need to do. Okay. Yeah, because not a. You have whether it's twenty five or five thousand out of pocket. It doesn't matter to me. Yeah. Right, so I'm going to go ahead and. Issue that change if you're okay with that. I don't see anything else where we could. I mean you're getting just about every discount. Except for you know of course the water shut off valves and the backup generator. But just like you said, it's I call thousands of dollars so it's not going to. Those the water shut off system that's some kind of a system that would like automatically if it detected a leak or something. Yeah, and those are I will tell you those are really good to have. I know I've had several customers that had to get these installed before I could write their policies because they had. A water claim, and it was we're talking like twenty five thousand dollars or fifty thousand dollars claim. Where they were gone or maybe on vacation or something, and their house was flooded. So a lot of carriers were not. I think they were getting non renewals from the current carriers and. Most of my carriers wouldn't even offer it because of the significant claims. Water claims are huge. They're hard to get someone else to write it and like you said you could possibly get a non renewal whenever it's significant you know like that but. I did have a carrier that said they would write it as long as they install one of these devices. And so they both called John Heating Air and Plumbing I believe. And they came out there and installed it. They ordered it and. Yeah, and it's the best thing. The guy I was talking to he said that he loves it and it's like an app on his phone and it'll it'll alert him if something happens. Or like detect the leak, it'll also let him know like how much usage each day. You know for your water and stuff. So he he said it's pretty cool. He was glad that you know we recommend doing that so. So how much it cost to do that? Do you say how much it was? Yeah, I've got I've got his invoice somewhere I can find it. Because we did have the bridge that he installed it, but both of them went through. John Heating. I think it was John Heating Air, but here it is. Let's see. John Plumbing Heating and Air Conditioning. I don't know if you're familiar with that company or not. Their. Greensboro. I think Again, anything that's not mounted is considered personal property. But with your rentals, you know, most people if it's most people would just have for their personal property like a refrigerator and washer and dryer. And sometimes they actually don't even have that. They require the tenant just to provide all that. And then some people have it fully furnished. So you know it it just depends on on how you all you know are you fully furnishing it. Is your children? Are you just a half and half kind of mostly yes. Like it's all my appliances, washer dryer, and refrigerator. To get ready to buy a new refrigerator and redoing the kitchen. So it's and then a couple I mean it's mostly their furniture bed sofa TV and everything we have a couple of of like antique dresser and passe and some things like that but. But that's likely they need to increase the personal property on this. Well, that's what I was asking about. Like what specifically is covered if it's three thousand? I mean, I think it's hard to. If say without the specific things, but I mean it's probably with that's probably the retail value of what it is now like it's a refrigerator, an old washer and dryer. I mean, at the time of was whatever it cost at that time, is it and that's replacement cost. I mean, how much do you just kind of take a inventory? How much? How much is the items that you have in there that's personal that's considered personal property? How much do you do you think that's value that today? It's hard to say because I haven't bought a refrigerator yet. I'm thinking those are about twelve or fifteen hundred, like about cheap as you can get. So that'll be the most expensive thing. It'll be a new fridge. And you got an older washer and dryer, probably another thousand. Yeah, they're not they're like when we were looking at them. So they're only worth two things, like worth three hundred dollars each. So it's less than a thousand. Okay, it's not like real nice big. It's like three thousand. Okay, all right. That sounds good. I think. Okay. Yeah, and we can always bump that up if you ever you know take deeper inventory and like saying you know I forgot this thing here and you know now is your son going to take out a renters policy. For his belongings. Yeah, he should. I haven't. Okay. Probably hasn't. And those are fairly cheap. You know we like those. I mean, and and you can get like usually our minimum is either fifteen depending on the carrier, but fifteen thousand would be a minimum and then. They can go up to however much like I I write a lot that starts at like twenty thousand if they have a small apartment. And then I mean, like I said, I wrote them up to like one hundred and fifty thousand. But they're you're talking about like a few hundred dollars for the year, like two two hundred for the year. Depending on how much you know, again, sure about that, but twenty thousand is usually like one hundred and twenty five dollars if you do twenty thousand. Okay, yeah, I'll I'll talk to him about that and they need to get your assistance on that. Sure, but yeah, that's that would definitely cover his belongings. Anything in there that is and it's also we always put five hundred thousand liability too. So if someone comes on the property and gets hurt, you know you and him's not going to be liable or sued. You know so we've got five hundred thousand liability. And then you've also got the personal umbrella. So that's just an added you know extra liability policy. Okay. So let's see where we are with this one. Okay, this one is one thousand twenty two sixty five. Was that after the paid in full discount? I'm making sure. Yes, paid in full is one thousand twenty two sixty five. That made about one hundred and sixty thousand dollars, one hundred and sixty dollars difference. I guess on annual. What do you think you want to leave it at that or you want to go back to twenty five hundred deductible? I think five thousand is good. Yeah, we're going to do what do okay. I'm fine with it. Okay. So I am going to we'll go ahead and buy this one if you're good with that. Okay. And then I'll get the other one canceled. But we're going to keep them all on the same date, right? Twenty third, just simple. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. All right. Yeah, so again, you'll get an application. This is going to be for the Han Boulevard or the dwelling fire. None of these properties are escrowed or have a mortgage, right? That's right. You pay in full for all these. All right, and the best email is Alright, I'm gonna look at. What about your auto policy? It went up 15 percent. It wasn't a huge, huge increase there. Yeah, we used to call that huge, and now compared to the other ones, it's been so huge. I know, I know. Um. Auto, I just don't know what we could do. Um. Let me go in and look at it. Are we insuring any of the goals of full coverage that could be dropped to? The canyon is. Let me just tell you about that. I just have two on there now, so that was the thing I dropped. I've already. That's right. Down to those two, and I was keeping collision on just the Traverse. Yeah, okay, yep. And think what's our what was our deductible on that? Think we'd already increased it once. We've got it 2, 5500 for liability, which that has to be because we've got an umbrella policy. So your liability limits are good; they need to stay there. And then that for uninsured and underinsured riders. We've got the Traverse. We've got 2, 5500, 250 for comprehensive 500. For collision, and then the canyon. Yeah, we we just have comprehensive 250 dollars. And of course, towing and labor on both of those being for the medical payment. The canyon, if you, it's costing 68 dollars a year for comprehensive. So. You're something what 68. 68 dollars for comprehensive. Yeah, it's too risky. Yeah, I need comprehensive because of all of our. Their deer jumps around out in front of you all the time, and a miracle I haven't hit one yet. Auto. Same for me. I was out in country. Gosh, I was somewhere that night. I was like in town, and there was one that ran out in front of me. Which I was I was in town, so I was going like 35 miles out so close. So I didn't hit it, but yeah. Usually they'll jump across the road going down 64 whenever I go home at night. But yeah, that's um. I really don't see anything on the auto that we could. That's going to really play a factor in the premium. Okay. What does this mean on the on what change though to say that the one of the bullets was prior carrier rating increase. What is it? What do I care about the prior? Are they talking about the prior insurance carrier? Yeah, I'm not sure what that is. To be honest with you, I am not sure. Okay. I see where that says that, and I I am not sure. I would have to call auto owners and find find that out because. Yeah, that's I think it's worth asking. Like I've never seen an increase. I know it is. I have any prior. Yeah. Oh. They were already they were the carrier for a full year, so it really shouldn't matter what anything in the prior was. Yeah, I am. I want to call because I I honestly don't know. I'm just writing this down like a note here. What if I call them? Prior carrier rating. Oh my god, I don't know. And the other question when they say, I understand about the. The North Carolina Rating Bureau. They want to say, but they say the premium we charge is the lesser. Have they? Is this premium they state? Has it already been compared? So that is the premium, or do they have to take this and and then compare to the rate bureau? It's already they've already done that. Okay. Yeah, yeah, I will. I'll um I'll find out about that. And I'll email you what my findings are. What they're saying that is. Prior carrier. Yeah, that makes me think of whoever you had before, but that shouldn't affect this policy. Yeah, that's what I would think. But then we didn't have any. As far as I can remember, besides, I don't even think maybe a couple years, few years ago, had a towing or something, but you know it's not like I had any. Claims that should have. Right. You know they came through later or something that they didn't know about when they wrote the first year. Okay. All right, and then I guess the next one is Dogwood. Oh yeah, I guess do the same 5000 change to that one too for the deductible. Just put it on all of them. Okay. Yeah, and these increases happen again next year. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna be. Thoroughly tempted to just go without insurance. I think. I know I hate yeah I hate that um. So it's saying your insurance score is 790. And Carolyn's is 814. Well, of course they take Carolyn, whoever has the highest is who they use to base the rating on. And I'll have to go back and look. I'm just raining down there. I have to go back and look at the others to see if that's the same. Can see we've got all the other policies related to this. Yeah, we just maxed out on the discounts all for multi policy discount property. Yeah, I've got these questions right answer. I'll email you what I found out. Okay, yeah, appreciate it. And do you want me to? Okay, let's see. Well, we're coming up on the 23rd. I was gonna, I was gonna go in and increase the discounts on the current policies, but. I don't know how much of a difference discounts or refunds you would get. Oh yeah, it's probably not worth it for two. I was gonna say I was just looking at the calendar. Yeah, yeah. All right. Yeah, so that's that. Did you have any other questions? I think that's it. And that enough. Well, and I'm not sure if you're going to be able to see the reflections. What we just did the changes. We didn't change anything on the auto, so we just basically changed your primary Cross Creek. And Dogwood, we don't say it's up to 2, 500. And then Han, of course, we rewrote that one. Right. I'm sorry, we increased the vessels to 5, 000 on the other two. And the umbrella, nothing changes really on that. Right. So that one is zero. It was zero five. Have you got? I'm not even seeing the renewal on that one. On the umbrella. Yeah, did it go up? They didn't. They didn't. You didn't send me a renewal thing. It actually went down because probably it's got to be because Jonathan is off my son and my. And one of the cars is off, so it went down. That's right. Okay. So yeah, it seems is the only thing that went down. I'm so sorry. I do. I hate it. I mean, I wish I had control over it, but I don't unfortunately. But that's what we basically been doing is just. Um, bumping everybody's deductibles up. I hope I'll set that hike. So you know if it if it ever levels off or comes down, I don't think it. I don't think we're going to see it come down. No, it never comes down, but hopefully the rate of increase can slow. Has all that's all. I hope it levels. I yes. Flattens off. Yeah, flattens out. Um. But yeah, I mean we can always adjust those deductibles. You know maybe. Um. But yeah, other than that, I really don't see anything. And if we rewrite you, it's not going to. I didn't have a carrier that's going to be like a significant savings. Like said, no more than 500. Yeah. But we will definitely look at it again next year. Even if even if you don't have an increase, just because it was such a large increase. This time around, we would still um reshop it. You know I'm going to remarket it again next year. Things are always changing. There, you know, we just don't know from year to year, but. Um. Some of those other carriers might be rating less, you know. But right now we just didn't. I didn't see it. For it would impact, make a huge impact. I'm moving all your policies. Okay. But yeah, you should see that reflect. I'm not sure if you'll see it now or it might take like overnight to sort of reflect on your M with the new renewal offers. Okay, and then how long you think it'll take for the cancellation and the new Han to show up? That'll be. Few days. Yeah, probably well you you probably should see the new one in there. Like I said, it usually I think with auto owners it usually takes overnight and everything clicks in the next day. So you should see how that. Yeah. You could actually you should be able to see the renewal. I mean the the new policy we just wrote now. If I'm not mistaken, since you you already found the application, it it may be in there. Okay. Because I can see on my M. And it's got on the old one. It's got cancellation effective 1123. So if you see cancellation, don't panic and think it's already canceled. If you notice, it'll say cancel cancellation and then it
