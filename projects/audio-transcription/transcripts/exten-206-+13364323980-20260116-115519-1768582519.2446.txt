Hey Jeff. Jeff, how are you, sir? I'm doing great. How are you? I'm good. I'm looking over the scenic motors. I just want to have a conversation with you. Sure, go ahead. I'm listening. The building at location three that has that collision center. Yes. Just kind of get to that other large building. Yep. What is three? Other large building because I can't. A Subaru dealership. Okay, so you got a dealership. It is. Yeah, I'm going to step outside. So I'm here. I'm in a crowded room. But give me a moment because I want to answer your questions. All right, no problem. Yeah, that is scenic Subaru dealership that has just really been completed renovations completed in the last six months maybe. Sounds that right? Maybe a year. It's not been long. The pictures online is they're doing construction. That's why. Yeah. Really was. Yep, and it's completed. They're in there, so it's been like probably closer to six months. All right, um, all right. I just want to make sure. I'm probably will have to get reinsurance for these, and I'm just trying to figure out is that going to price us out or not. If well, is that the only are those the only? Well, I guess one building, two buildings. Ever how that's looked at, and I swear you know that you can see they're either touching or they're part of the same. I don't know how they've done that, and we kind of just spitballed the TIV on that. The other ones came from their current policy with Utica. I believe. Yeah. And I don't know where they are to be honest. I can't remember off top of my head, but I think we ended up at a total of twelve on that location three. One building, two buildings, whatever it is. That may or may not be accurate. Right now, their current policy is showing seven million total. And we just felt like it needed more than that, but now we may have put too much on it. So their their location one, the ones down the street, no problem. Okay. Location location number two, which is the I guess it's a Chevy dealership. Chevrolet. Yep. Yep, that's a newer building. Yep. Closest building to location three from there is actually 250 feet away, which is far enough for us to consider that a separate location. Right. Okay. Yep. But location two, your based on your value is nine million one hundred eighty seven thousand, which is under ten, so that's fine. We got no problem there either. So okay, it's fine. So now we're taking in location three. Gotcha. And we're right at four with the numbers you sent in. We're right at fourteen thousand seven fifty three in value. Once I get some ten packs and some things that have value for us on policy to add to the property amount subject worksheet for us. And it's going to take it over fifteen, and I just found out something from my underwriter. We our treaty says that anything over twenty million we have to go buy fact facaded insurance on it. However, if it's a dealership an auto dealership, it does not fall. Fact and we have to buy reinsurance at fifteen million. So okay, this is going to take us over fifteen million with the values that we have now. Okay. It's probably you know. You know, oh yeah, I'm not. I I don't have a problem taking a stab at and see what happens, but again, I'm not as. To be honest, Christopher said, "Why don't we just instead of seven million, which is what Utica had both buildings at?" Christopher said, "That's nowhere near enough." So he said, "Just send in the Chevrolet dealership for five million." I mean that's as that's as much work as we did on that. So that I don't know how you know the square footage is right, the building information is right, the the coverage amount. It may be right, but if it is, it's just we just spitball that to get it out. So a little homework for me if you don't mind and seeing. Okay. They think and what you think, building one and building two would be individually and. Certain, I've got to do them together for sure. Okay, and I feel like that's how I think we'd want them, and and not that it will matter. We'll get the right number on it, but what number would that need to be? To keep us out of the reinsurance thing, which might help our pricing. Fifteen million. Anything over fifteen million, I'm going to have to get back on that look. Yeah, because there's a. So so at what would
