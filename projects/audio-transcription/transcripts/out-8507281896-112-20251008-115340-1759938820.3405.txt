Hello. Hey Jennifer, this is Brandi with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm good. Thanks. How are you, Brandi? Good. I'm just getting y'all pulled up here. Give me one second. Okay, so currently you are with in MGM, which is Main Street America. Of course, they're getting out of the business with North Carolina, and really it's because they lost money. In the past years. We lived in Florida. We knew how that worked. Yeah, so they have lost money. So that's why they're pulling out, and in the past. That should be illegal, honestly. They have, um, and and the reason why they have lost money is because they never increased the prices on their homeowners policies or auto policies to keep up with everything else. Right. So their homeowners policies or auto policies were very cheap. They beat everybody else's price, and now, I mean they can't you know do anything. So I tried to look for other companies to put your house with. Now you do have a a second home that is with auto owners. So there's only a select few companies that we have that will do home only. And auto owners was the best price best fit for coverage to make sure that you're not losing anything and to make sure that your house is 100 replacement cost. Okay. Now I can tell you that if we were to add on an auto policy with auto owners, it would make the home a little bit better with discounts, but just being a standalone home by itself with auto owners, it is a little pricey. Um. So. But you just we cannot change right now because of some stuff on our car insurance is that right? So let's see. You do have. I don't think that they were going to give you. Gotta read back through my notes real quick. Because there was something because I couldn't do it with auto owners. I could do it with National General, but it split up. You would have the discount on the auto, just not the the home. Um. So I don't know if it's beneficial to y'all or not doing it that way. Um. And on this quote also I have to add on the, Alliance count. Um honestly let let me just give you an idea where we are. We are probably going to be selling this house in January. We worked out an agreement with our neighbors. We're house swapping. So this will just be a temporary policy. If that helps at all. Well, it might help in your favor. Um with the so. Okay, so for the price of this home, even if you stay in it until January, you'll still get the refund back because you do have a mortgage on this home. So it is built through escrow. They will end up paying the whole thing and then whatever you don't use. Come term January, we cancel this policy and then get you a new homeowners policy on the new home. You'll get that refund of whatever months you did not use. Okay. So at for the coverage on this home itself, I'll just go over the home first. This home for replacement cost is coming in at one million point three. Okay. To rebuild the home from the bottom up. Um. Now on your other policy, it was under that amount. So Main Street America was not giving enough coverage, and that's why the price was so low. Now they did have something built into that policy that you know if something were to happen you would get a certain percentage more. Um, but in this case switching over to auto owners, you have 100 replacement cost on this home. You would also get um. 25% more if needed. Of course, you know we're looking at a temporary solution right now, but it has everything that you had on it before. You'll have your home covered, your personal property, in or outside the home covered as well. And that's almost at it's a little over 900, 000. That is just a certain percentage of the amount of the replacement cost for the home. Because that number that number can be adjusted if you don't think you have that much, but it's not going to cut down the price as much. I always say it's best to have more on that part than not have enough. Okay, and this is all auto owners are telling me about. Yes, auto owners, and you still have the personal liability. Of course, if you're ever held liable for somebody else's property damage or. Or them getting hurt on your property, anything like that, that's going to cover you up to 500, 000, and then you also have medical payments for anybody that were to come into the home or own your property and get hurt. That is 5, 000 towards their medical payments. The the deductible once you get over Um, but this is all the information that we take from the tax card. We do look at other things. The company has their own rating system as well. On everything that it took to build that house, if they think that it needs more, then they'll come back and say, "Hey, we need to add a little bit more." Okay. But honestly, from where you're coming like coming from the Main Street America policy to now, you're getting like a huge increase on coverage. Okay. Um. And so you said the higher deductible would be less. Did you ever tell me how much that would? Yeah, I haven't gotten that far because every time. Okay, sorry. No, you're fine. Every time I get to the last page, it like just freezes. So I ended up starting over. Oh gosh. And I'm hoping that this next click will uh will get me to. And I'm sorry for being so ignorant. That how does this compare to what we paid for Main Street America? So what you paid for a Main Street America was almost five thousand. Oh no, not even five thousand. It was four thousand two hundred and eighty-four. Is what you would pay with them. Per year. That was just this past year. The year before, um, it was like right at four thousand. So they only increased it two hundred and eighty dollars. And I'm not even sure that they gave you because I didn't look at the previous year. But for for that amount of increase, I don't think that they increased your dwelling amount. Typically with them, if they went up to like four hundred dollars, they would have added on maybe like ten or fifteen thousand. Okay. So five thousand dollar deductible would drop the policy to seven thousand one hundred and eighty-six. Okay. And if you are thinking it'll be January. So really, you're only looking at putting two thousand about two thousand five hundred into the payments, and you're going to get the rest of that five thousand back. Okay. A little less than five thousand. Probably forty-eight thousand, somewhere right around in there. Forty-eight hundred. Sorry, forty-eight hundred. Is what you would end up getting back. So who all did you said you got quotes from National General and auto owners? Yeah, so the National General is for your auto policy. Um. Just for the auto policy because Ruth is still um you know of course an inexperienced driver. Trying to put her on. It was because of that and then there was some claims in the past and that's why auto owners wouldn't take it. They would, but you would not have the coverage that you want to have. Um. It would have just been liability only, no coverage, physical damage coverage on any of the vehicles. Um. So for all of the vehicles, I did one hundred dollar on comprehensive, five hundred dollar for collision, and those are your deductibles. That's what you would pay. Comprehensive is rocket in the windshield, animal running out in front of you, hail damage, things like that. Collision is whenever you hit something head on, like a car, a sign, or if you were to run off into a ditch. You would pay the five hundred dollars. There is also rental and towing on all of these vehicles as well. Towing is not just for towing; it's for if you had a call a towing company to come out there to give you a jump start. If you locked your keys in the car, most of the newer cars you don't have that problem anymore. Um, but it's still possible. Also for changing the spare tires if you had a flat, they would come out and do that. It is up to a hundred dollar reimbursement. You get to choose whoever you want to, and they'll come out and you just save the receipt. You give it to us, we'll turn that in and then you'll get your money back. Um, the rental coverage is if you are in an accident and that car's in the shop for a little while, you get a rental car while that car is being fixed. So for every single car having all of those coverages, you can increase the deductible to get the price lower. That's just an average one hundred five hundred, but having this, it would be a down payment of five sixty eight seventy six and then monthly payments would be four sixty five ninety and this is for a year long policy. So your your policy won't increase every six months if you have a six month policy right now. And that's with National General. Yes. Okay, that sounds good. And I can send both quotes over to you. I just wanted to talk to you. I mean, I know that I had sent sent them over, but and with the five thousand, but I can resend them to you. That way you can look them over. With damage, I just wanted to make sure like I didn't want y'all
