Samuel, you there? Yeah, hey, how's it going? Going good. You got both of my messages. Let me see. I got. Let me see. You say. You said the monthly premium. Is twelve ninety five. Yeah, if you do it monthly, then you will. You will have to do it on an automatic draft, so it has to come automatically off of a card or checking account. Okay, let me see here. You said twelve ninety five. That I think that was the full full year. Oh, let me pull this up. Yeah, let me pull this up. One hundred and twelve dollars and ninety five cents for both vehicles, liability only, and that's a monthly amount. And what was the monthly amount you said? One twelve and ninety five cents. That's for the Volkswagen and the Acura. It is the Jetta and the Acura. Okay, because I don't think I'm gonna. I'm not sure how long I'm gonna hold on to the Jetta because I may or may not end up. Selling the title over to a friend. I haven't quite figured that out yet. But but it is titled to you, correct? Correct. Correct. Okay, yeah, so we would need to put it on that policy. Sure, okay, that's fine. Until you get rid of it, and then of course you just call us if we can take it off. Okay, okay, that's fine. So then, that would. Is that getting is that just is that a new policy or that just added to the policy currently? That's a new policy in your name with your address. Okay. Okay, that's um. It's not bad. Then in that case, let me just um. Now let me say this. Let me say this to Sam. There was not a lot of difference in the quotes that I did. I'm talking maybe. Fifty dollars a year. Showing that incident you had on there, and without it. But now when we run the finalized quote here, National General did pick up on that same information. So there was not a lot of difference. If if you are. I don't know what they quoted you when they added you to your fiance's policy. It should not have been a you know a very big difference. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Because I think that she. I think she pays. I forget exactly what it was. I think it would be. Like three hundred more dollars every six months to add me to it. And they just said this is the quote. Without it, I think it had you without the car. Yeah, and then I think they were saying that oh. It just will cost more, and I don't think they. Specified. I don't know if we got that far. I think we were more just so trying to figure out. Because I called the the courthouse office and they were saying, "Well, since it was dismissed, I don't see why you should have. " I don't know, but I guess it's because it's on my driving record. I'm a you know. It's because of that accident report. When that accident report went in, then it automatically is filed with the DMV, and so it's going to show up on there. Okay, and then I looked at. I've actually pulled my driving record from the DMV and it said zero points added. Correct. So so. It's just the fact that there was an accident that took place. Is I guess. Let let me clarify that you can have driver's license points and not have insurance points. Okay. Okay. The insurance points. When you when you have an accident, let's say just like happened to you, you get a ticket. And you had an accident. There was a report filed. You got a ticket. You can get the ticket dismissed, but you can't get get the accident dismissed from your record. Okay. Now because it because it was zero dollar payout and no claims paid out. And that is a waveable thing for you for three years. So there's no points charged for that. But if you have another accident. Within the next three years, then they can go back and collect that one point on the one you just had last year. Gotcha. But because the dollar amount fell below the threshold of payments. Then you're not being charged any insurance points for that. Gotcha. Okay, okay, so. Okay, all right. Let me let me talk to. My fiance and then I may just end up giving you a call back. Are your guys hours like eight to five? It is. We'll be here. Okay. And then of course we'll be here every day. So. Okay, so I may give you guys a call back either. Either before the end of the day or tomorrow, and then if. Do you? Is there a way for you to
