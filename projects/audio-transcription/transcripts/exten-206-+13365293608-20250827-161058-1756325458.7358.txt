Hello, this Jeff, can I help you? And Jeff, how you doing? This is Carlos Bocanegra. Hey, Carlos. Hey, how are you? All right, all right. So, um, Catherine and Canistra are my partner. She's actually in. She's a burning man right now. I'll tell you that. So she's not, she's she has very limited. Time to be able to get on the phone or actually just service. So I'm taking care of this whole cancel policy cancellation thing. Okay. I just got off the phone with P H H, our mortgage company, and they just stated, we're sorry. Yes, you're right. We were supposed to pay that out. And so I think they tried to give you a call maybe 10 minutes ago and then they were directed to the other insurance company or some one of the underwriters or something. So we were on a three-way call. They stated that they would just pay out the money and then the other person stated, no, we have to have Jeff, your your agent, contact the underwriter first. To get approval that like the policy could be reinstated and then. And that's likely that that is possible. So let me let me get up to. Let me get that punched in here. Hang on one second. So it sounds like you call Westfield directly. I did not my somebody did. Yeah, P H H did and then they put us on a three-way call and then they were telling me what had to happen in order for the policy to be reinstated. Okay. Yep, I understand. I was told that that might be a possibility. I wasn't expecting. I didn't really know who might be calling to make the payment to be honest. So honestly, and they didn't give me a reason why because they've been paying this. I don't know why they were like, oh yeah, well it looks like there's 2000 dollars owed. We didn't pay it out and I was like, okay. Well, how did that? Here's what I was told by Westfield and I don't have my notes in front of me but I will try to paraphrase. It looks like this was set up on semi annual payments, which is. I've never seen semi annual payments. When a mortgagee is actually making the payments, this is the only time in 29 years I've seen it set up on anything other than an annual premium basis when a mortgagee is making the payment. So apparently that's how it was. Then sometime and I may have my dates wrong. I think this policy renewed January to January. Sometime Westfield was contacted and they said that it was Kathy. To put this on monthly payment, and I'm not sure if that's factual or not. That's what I was told by Westfield. And then there had there's not been a payment made since that time and that's what kicked it into cancel mode. So when I talked to them yesterday, they said, yeah, here's what's going to be owed to bring it up to speed. It can still be paid monthly if you choose. Don't feel like there'll be an issue getting it reinstated. So that's when I reached out to Kathy, assuming she would be the one to or or you would be the one to call me back and then we go through the process to get it paid. So all that being said, I guess I need to reach out to Westfield, get approval for this thing to be reinstated. And at the same time, I guess have access to someone or for someone. To make this payment. So then P H H stated that they gave me a phone number because they don't have direct lines. But both of them stated they were notating it all in their notes. Exactly what was discussed. Okay. So the underwriter should have everything that was stated by P H H. Okay. So you're talking about Westfield. Westfield's underwriter should have made notes here. On this. Yeah, so they should know. They stated the person that we were on the phone with. They did that they weren't our personal underwriter. Sure. But we had to contact our underwriter. But they would have all the notes there of everything that that we talked about. And then P H H stated the exact same thing that like when you call, they'll know that the payments need to be made. They just need your approval or our underwriter's approval first before the payment can be made in the policy. Right. And then once that's done, what is my next step? Is P H H going to call them back or how? How? Because my my part in this would be to go through Westfield and get approval for reinstatement. Okay. So let's just assume they say, yeah, we'll reinstate it. We just need a payment
