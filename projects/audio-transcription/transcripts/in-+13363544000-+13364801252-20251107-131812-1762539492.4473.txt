You think? I'm doing good. I got a question. Okay. My mortgage, on my home owner's insurance, it's it's the same servicer but a different company like it used to be Movement Mortgage and now it's Lakeview Loan Servicing. Did you get a letter? From them. Yes. Okay, the best thing to do, can you email that letter to us and that way we can update the policy with it. Okay. Yeah, I got it in the mail. Like I don't, I don't have email to do that. Like. Can you take a picture of it? On your phone. Yeah, yeah, I could do that. Yeah, try to take a good, clear picture of it and then I can give you the we have a a text number here you can send it to. You know what I can even probably do. I just drove by your store. Okay. Yeah, you want to run in there. Yeah, but yeah, I'm gonna go do a quick stop and then I'll run in there on the way back through. Okay, that sounds fine, Gary. Now are you in are you in there or no? I'm not, but I can send them a message and let them know you're going to drop in there and then they can just make a copy of that for you and then we can get that updated. Okay, all right, all right. So yeah, I'll stop in there in about oh about a half hour. Okay, that sounds good, Gary. Very good. All right, all right, Deena. Thank you so much. It was nice talking to you.
