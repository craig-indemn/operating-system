Good morning, Miss Kala. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? This is Gary with Alliance Insurance, and we were just doing doing the annual calls on your updates for your rental property. Needed to find out if you had any changes or did anything to the house during the past year that we need to update for you. Nothing changed. Nothing changed. It's all the same. All the same. Very good. Thank you so much. And when you get that renewal, just make sure that you go through your paperwork. And make sure the information is correct on there, and then if we need to change anything, we can do that for you. What about when am I getting the renewal? Just a second. It's not due until the first part of February. Okay. And you should you should get the new paperwork sometime. I would say by the middle of next month. But we try to do these calls at least 60 days in advance so we can make the changes before the renewal comes out. But when you get that paperwork, if you will just go through that and make sure everything's correct. Okay, nothing changed though. Okay, I look forward to seeing the paperwork then. Thank you so much. You have a blessed day. Thank you. Bye bye.
