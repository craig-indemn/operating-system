Hello. Hey, Aaron. Hey, yes. Hey, how's it going? Well, it's going. Good news and I got some bad news. Okay. Well, I'll just give you the bad news because I think you're going to like the good news. The bad news is. And again, brother, I have no idea. I just I touch policies all day long. It is amazing to me how easily it happens where people's information gets screwy. I think part of it is software based. I think the other fact is just that. Insurance is not in front of your brain all the time and people don't look at it. But yeah. Amelia's driver's license information was wrong. It did not reflect her information. It was pulling some other lady that was apparently 100 years old and that license had. Expired and been revoked. So when this thing. What? Yeah, it was it was showing that the driver's license number for Amelia was pulling to another lady that was 100 years old. Is 100 years old. I'm guessing if she's still alive anyway. And and her driver's license had been revoked and had expired. So it was pulling all that nonsense into this upcoming renewal and had jumping costs. So. What I did was I called that gen. I had them update Amelia's correct driver's license information and then rerun the NVR. Not only did it drop the premium on this renewal, it also dropped the premium on the current term. So you were going to get a check in the mail for 281 dollars and 97 cents. 281 dollars and what? 281.97. Okay. Yep, that's current term. And then on this renewal term, it's now giving her two years of driving experience. And it dropped the premium down to 1, 854. 55 cents. The new monthly payment. Just make sure that this is going to stay the same. Yeah, so monthly payment you're set up on auto pay off the credit card. Yes. It's going to draft 157. 39 cents per month. Okay. Say that one more time: 157 month. Well, the the August payment is 157 and 39 cents. Okay. And then future payments from there is 157. 56 cents. So I'll call it 158 bucks a month. Just makes it easy, man. Okay, that's beautiful. That's beautiful. Yep. All right, so what is that? Is that the old license that was popping up that was like that? Is everything good on the new one? Yep, clicking in. Let me let me double check it. Yeah. Yeah. So what I'm gathering from it is basically somebody tried to steal her identity. I don't know that well. I mean, Lord, maybe. I can't rule it out. Or at least her information through some type of stuff like that. Well, let me explain like this. Right when when when we go, I say we like I'm a human before I'm an agent. Right when I go to purchase. Auto insurance, home insurance, life insurance, health insurance, whatever it is. Right, I take my information. To the agent or to the insurance carrier, they then look at my information. And then they charge me premium based on my risk. And my risk is different from your risk and it's different from. My mom's and your family members and whoever. Because there's credit scores. Where you park your vehicles at night, what you drive, what your driving history is. There's a credit score. There's also an insurance score, which is slightly different from a credit score, but it also pulls back to your credit score. All that information out there and is. You know, not housed. Yeah, it's all background. It's just out there in the world, right? Exactly. Yeah. How's that data? They sell it. The insurance carriers buy that data from. You know I don't even know two dozen different companies that store our data. Yeah. Somewhere. They had her driver's license tied to some other lady. And I've. God don't tell me simple as I can say I have no idea how that happened. I don't know why it hadn't been flagged. I don't know why it hadn't been. Weirdly enough, weirdly enough. Normally, when something is wrong in the background, it's usually the DMV that will flag it. Yeah. And the DMV will mail something to to the client. And say, Hey, contact your insurance agent. That's usually how people are alerted. Yeah. So I don't know. I have no idea how that got screwy. But I'm glad I called to check in on my renewal. Yeah, yeah
