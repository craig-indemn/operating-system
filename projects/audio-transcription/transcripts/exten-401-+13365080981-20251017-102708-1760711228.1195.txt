Hello, Heather. Heather, this is Linda Redwine. I think you've been. Hey. And he told me. He told me to call you because what I was interested in, especially with getting the homeowners insurance lowered some. He said you had a plan. So yeah, I want to hold on just a second. Let me get that account pulled up. Um. So you currently have SafeCo right, Liberty Mutual for both home and auto. Yes. Yes. Okay. And I tell you all those quotes were coming in pretty close. Um, wasn't like it's the angel Amanda Saydon. Uh huh. But the thing is with the ones that we have, that I could save you some. Um. I think he mentioned you pay monthly. Do you usually pay monthly? Installment for both the home and auto. See that only thing with Northwest Farmers that's the one that came in the best. The best coverage for the best price. They require you to do. That I don't think they offer a monthly option. It would be quarterly. I can't do that. You can. I live in office social security so I have to. I get it. I know. That's what I was afraid of because he did I think he mentioned, you did monthly installments. So. Let's see if I have another option. He was telling me about another one. I can't remember what it was now. Who said? Yeah, I'm gonna have to go back and I'll just I'll even run it by Northwest Farmers because they did have the best. Um. Now who is your? Do you have a local agent, Linda? Someone that I call for these. Yes. Yeah, your current agent with SafeCo. Do you call? Do you have to call like a company directly or do you call? I had the one I called. I hadn't called in a long time. It was a woman named Tisha Walker. That's your agent that you usually deal with. I guess she's an agent. I don't know anything about insurance. My husband always sit here there. Yeah, is she? Is she local? That I don't know because Johnny was the one that told me to call her when I got this with Liberty Mutual and SafeCo. She's the one that. Sit that out. I was going to say if if anything we could at least like if I can't save any money we could take those SafeCo policies and roll them over to the agency here and we would be able to manage them for you like if you were looking for like. Just a local agent. That's an option, but I know you are definitely trying to save some money. Um. So yeah, I'm gonna have to go back and go through all my proposals that we got. We got a lot back. Johnny told me about one, but I can't remember who it was or anything that he thought was progressive. Okay, the progressive. We could do monthly on that. And for your auto policy, that will be a little bit less than SafeCo. Um. And we could definitely do monthly of that, but I would like to keep them together at home. Um. And still save you at the same time. So. Yeah, he did. Tell me about one that was less for the homeowners. That was the one I was really interested in getting less. Well, that was Northwest Farmers. Yeah. And like I said, they don't offer a monthly payment plan. Okay. Um. Let me see what's about to come yesterday. I think. Do you have email? I think I see. See you on it too. Included you in that email. Yes. Uh huh. Um. I want to say it was like 300 dollars every quarter. That was for Northwest. Yeah. Yeah, that's not going to work for you. No, I can't do that. Yeah, it's 1385. Yeah, so let me. I'll call them to see if they can make an exception. Um. And if I'll. Hold on a second. Let me see if I can go back. Hold on. Let me see if I can go back to the email without losing you. And see what you say it. Okay. Hello. Yes, ma'am. I'm here. I'm still here. Hello. Yeah, I'm here. I couldn't find. I couldn't find it. I'm just these phones and all this technology is just beyond me. So so Linda, how do you pay monthly? Do you send a check every month to SafeCo? Do you write a check? SafeCo, yes, Liberty Mutual. Liberty Mutual just rolls it out of the bank. Which is right? Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay. So let me just go back and revisit all of our proposals. Um. If I can get you anything better, and then also I will call
