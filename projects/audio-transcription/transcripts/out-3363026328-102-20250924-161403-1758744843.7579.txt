Hello, it's Matt. Hi, this is Gloria. I'm calling from Alliance Insurance. How are you doing today? Hey Gloria, all right, good. How are you? I'm good. I'm sorry to miss your call. That's all right. So yeah, getting a insurance audit. And I just I had not gotten any correspondence about it. So the call was a little blindsiding. Maybe it was sent somewhere some other way. I'm not sure. It was told that I could contact you and ask ask some questions. Hold on one second. I'm going to turn on my car and my phone's going to want to switch to my car just a second. Yes. Thanks. Okay, so first, can you just give me an update on can you review the policy that I have right now with you guys or I guess through you guys with auto owners for my general liability. Yes, sir. So it's Pigham personally homes. What's the they're they're auditing it because they need to make sure that the coverage amount and the premium amount are appropriate. Is that right? Yes, so because it's almost so what what happened is every end of the policy term they just go basically over whatever detail we had to input on the beginning of the the beginning of your policy term and like payroll estimated exposure like how much your business is going to be making and sometimes they do ask about if you have sub contractors if you have like you provide the repair insurance exactly so that's correct so that so that's basically what they do and then making sure that it matches it matches what the data they have matches with the data we provided and sometimes you can get refund from that or sometimes you can it can be maybe your exposure is higher was higher than it was original estimated and then you get a bill this is and this is a common practice this isn't something that is you know indicative of any any issues this is this is just a common review yes sir it's common okay and what currently is my premium right now okay let me let me log into Orona okay your premium now it's four thousand and eighty seven four thousand and eighty seven dollars and that's for how much general liability yes that's for general liability the whole general liability for uh September least September 27 to September 27 and 2026 what's the coverage what's the coverage amount see what the commercial advisory covers like the same limits you get like the general aggregate you have three hundred thousand okay and then the product product completed operations you have three hundred thousand as well and then medical pay you have five thousand for each for any person and then you have hired and hired auto and non owned auto for a million each okay unless in case of your business in damage premises you have fifty thousand okay yes well in personal personal under but I think Angel you have a hundred K and this is for Pigham personally homes yes so yes this is general liability for the location 2129 Linwood yeah that's that's just that's just my partner's address of of our business we don't actually have a brick and mortar location okay yeah so so this is like generally what is in the policy of your what the general liability coverage limit for your business okay and are you I feel like I remember working with someone else are you the agent that I should go to to for different policies and adjustments yes policy yes so I am um your so your main I will be your main contact and the Joe is your um the person who wrote the policy for you so I am your servicing person okay all right um so for the audit what is the information that I need and who do I submit that to um the the Orona when they sent you the paper I didn't have any kind of instruction on where to submit he he just I guess it's the guy that emailed me today he just emailed me this so I um yeah I'll get back in touch with him yes you can submit them to him and then um I'm thinking they will need like your payroll if you have the details for that and then if the subcontractors gave you um their like COIs you can submit those too as well and then if you would like I can go ahead and um reach out to Orona and see who is taking care of your audit and then um ask them what they will be needing in details and then I can give that information to you okay I I have I think I have what I need I'll I'll reach out to him and and go from there okay awesome awesome okay thank you for your help you're welcome just let us know if there's anything else we can help with sure thing thanks bye bye bye bye have a good day.
