Thank you for holding this. Is Heather? How can I help you? Hey, it's your pet the insurance person here. No, you're fine. So um, I spoke with them. They asked for me to send a written request. So the written request has been done. She's released this to be reinstated. I am not one hundred percent sure that I will be able to access today. It might be like an overnight process for that reinstatement to show on our end, and then all of that can be sent. As far as raise deductibles to tomorrow, but they are going to to let us reinstate. So at least we'll have a policy, and then we can look at the the change in deductibles and that kind of thing. So they did honor that. Okay, so then once they look at the change in the deductible and that that we own our home and that we can look and see what the rate will be. Yes, yes. I've got a reminder for me to check on this first thing in the morning. Today was meeting day and I came in late, so I do apologize for not getting directly back with you. But everything on our end is done as far as we can go until we actually have access. But they did approve it, so we're good there. Okay, so then now we just got to wait to see what the rate will be, and you might know that you might know that tomorrow. Yeah, I should I should know that tomorrow because usually they just um, I guess download overnight if you will, and then that way it will be showing active versus this cancel pending that's showing right now where I can't access anything on the renewal. Okay, all right. So then I wait to hear from you tomorrow. Yes, that sounds good. All righty, thanks. All right, so thank you. Bye. Bye.
