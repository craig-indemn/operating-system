Hello. Griffin Kevin. Kevin, can you hear me? Hello, can you hear me, Kevin? Hey, this is Jamie from Lines Insurance. How are you, sir? I'm good. How about you? Man, I'm hanging a man. I think I think I missed lunchtime, but outside of that, I'm. I'm pretty good, pretty good today. How can I help you? What's going on? I did I did listen to a voice message something about a Chrysler, but I wanted. Make sure I talk it through with you. Make sure I wasn't the same thing. Well, I was actually going over some figures from a another quote that I had actually gotten. In comparison, one that we have, and I noticed whenever I was putting all this together that it looks like that there is no collision coverage on the Chrysler Pacifica. Let me review it. Let's see here. Okay, Kevin Johnson, 6185 Riverdale Drive in Hop Point is what I'm looking at. I've got you and Donna as drivers. There's three vehicles. The 2022 Chrysler Pacifica touring shows up with a comp towing, and that's it. You get a hundred dollar deductible for comp. There is no collision on the Chrysler Pacifica. Your 2008 Honda Accord has comp collision and towing, and then your 89 Dodge D Series is liability only, but you do have towing on there. You got towing on all three vehicles. The the the need collision. I don't have a lien holder for either of the vehicles. No, not a borrowing money person. I don't do. Yeah, yeah, good. That's good mother. Yeah, you made a quote to add collision to it. For you, yeah, I need the collision on the Pacifica because that's. That's the that would be a pretty good chunk of money to come up with at one time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see here. Okay. As far as the Honda's concerned, it's actually. I mean, it's probably only worth about fifteen hundred bucks two thousand very much. You know because we had all the hail damage to it a while back, and so they've held it out. Yeah, yeah. And so I went over. Reason carrying the. The collision on it, I think just probably comp only, and it would probably be sufficient. Okay. All right, so let me let me let me do some moving here. All right, so current term premium is seventeen. Let me write this down here: seventeen oh seven and twenty cents. And this thing's renewing on the thirteenth. We'll eat this apple one by the time here. I'm going to quote first of all. Just add collision to the Chrysler. We'll add it with five hundred dollar deductible. That's what you got on the Honda Accord. Okay, so just adding collision to the Chrysler. Is going to affect the money. It's going to add two hundred forty nine dollars and ninety eight cents total to the whole annual policy. So the new the new money is nineteen fifty seven and eighteen cents, so one thousand nine hundred fifty seven dollars and eighteen cents. Okay, all right. Now going backwards. And if we remove collision from the Accord, you want to leave your deductible. So so so removing collision from the Accord would leave comp and towing on it. You currently got a hundred dollar deductible for comp coverage. You want to leave that at a hundred dollars, or are you comfortable bumping that up? Anything higher, that would find you some savings too. If if you want, but don't let me talk into that. If that's if you want a hundred dollar deductible, that is certainly. Well, I mean, the the comp the comp coverage is relatively. You got a hundred dollars. It does, yeah. And it's okay. Yeah, yeah. Um, you know comp covers glass and rocks and windshields. So you know for for me personally, I like the hundred dollar deductible just because. You know a hundred dollar windshield is a hundred dollar crack. It's a lot easier to emotionally swallow than say you know five hundred dollar deductible there. So okay, so just. And the reason I want to have the comp coverage on there is because you know the windshields these days with all the. Electronic stuff built into them, like the Pacifica has, for example, it's got the following: two close, click on the brakes for you, all that kind of good stuff. Those things you don't you don't replace a windshield anymore for two hundred bucks. Absolutely not, Kevin. I saw I had a Lexus. It wasn't even a brand new. It was like a twenty it was like a twenty one or twenty two Lexus the other day. The windshield was thirteen hundred dollars. Yeah, because it had smart glass. It all had to be calibrated and. Yep, I I did submit it with checking account number. So let's see here. Let's see. Okay, is the ten. All right, so we gotta receive. Let me refresh this thing and just make sure all this stuck here. Okay, so as of right now, policy is showing paid in full. It does reflect the payment of eighteen seventy seven ninety that I just made. You and Donna are drivers. The Pacifica has comp and collision and towing. Hundred dollar deductible for comp, five hundred for collision. The cord is on there with comp only hundred dollar deductible. It's got coverage. Your ninety eight Dodge just has towing. Okay, I'm going to print you a deck page showing the new coverage changes. I'm also going to email you receipt. I'm sending it to klj three five seven eight one dot com. That's what I got in system for it. That email's still good and working there. Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Good deal. All right. You want to take care of Homers too while I'm at it. Yeah, yeah. Let's do the whole thing. Okay. All right. Let's see here. Payment okay. Okay, forgive me, Kevin. I don't remember all those numbers that you gave me there. But in the auto one system, there's a couple different payment methods that you've used in the past. There's two checking account numbers that are in here. One of them is checking account ending in five eight one nine with State Employees Credit Union. And the other one is a State Employees Credit Union with checking account number ending in six six four two. Are either one of those good or you want to add? They're both still good, but I would rather do it. The other account. If possible, really well. While I'm messing with this here, would you like me to delete that information out of here? I don't want to know that either. As far as deleting it, no, let's just delete there because both those are still active accounts. Okay, I'll leave that alone then. You do have an expired visa ending in oh eight eight. I'm going to get that out of here. Just get that. If you want to change that, that's fine. We can do that while we're doing change stuff. It's not going to change anything. That's just that's on, Kevin. Just do a background information that is lingering around and I try to clean that up at once when I see it just because. God knows everything of security risk these days. I don't want you to. Oh yeah. You know so. If it showed expired, if it didn't show expired, I'm tempted to delete it, but I just delete out there. Okay, so you said this account is a savings account. Go ahead and read me the routing number. Let me get back to where that was at. Two five three one seven seven zero four nine. I need the account number. Is. Oh shoot. Six one two one five seven five four. Be okay to save this one for future use. Yes, that'd be fine. Okay. Six one two one five seven five four. I'm going to process this for twenty two ninety two. Payment. And it is scheduled for today. And I got a bingo confirmation number on this one as well. So I'll just print this receipt. I'm going to email you all of this. Let's make sure this thing is saved here. Receipt. Alrighty, I don't think there's anything else. Travel trailer policy is progressive. I think it's probably paid. I'll put eyes on that though just to make sure. Yeah, it is. I mean it was. Oh, love that to be. For you at the same time, everything else is, but you know. There's you know there's a lot of things I can change. The one thing that's a sticker that. I can't change is the date of the expiration and renewal. The only way that could be moved, Kevin, would be if we cancel that policy and completely reroute it. Effective the same date as your home and auto, right? But but the headache of that would be. Rates have changed since this thing was written, and it would probably change the money. So I I can't I can't in good conscience recommend that to you. The travel trailer policy is active; it's paid in full. On the twenty twenty four CT. Let me just make one more look here. Make sure nothing else is in there. Yeah, I think that's it. I think you're good, brother. I'm going to email you proof of coverage and a couple receipts here. Is anything else I can help you with today? I think that'll do it, Jamie. I think that takes care of that for the next year and. And just put it to bed and be done with it. Okay, Kevin, your business is appreciated
