Sorry about the hole. This is Gloria with Alliance Insurance. How can I help today? Hello, Miss Gloria. Yes, ma'am. How are you doing today? This is Lennox. Good. I was coming to ask a question. So my mom is going to be moving here. Yes. And but she don't drive it anything but she have a car. Yes. It's in her name. And I need to get it registered here and I'm going to use it for the transportation. Tell me what I need to do. Okay, so you want to add the vehicle to your commercial auto to use it for the business. Yes, but she does. But she's still paying for the car. She don't have a title to it, so she's like the owner. And I'm just going to be the um agent for my. Okay, I forgot what they call it. Agent for my insurance, for the business insurance. But I got to get it registered to North Carolina. Okay, all right. Um, let me let me um, let me look into. Wait, we do find out about what you needed exactly because since the the car title is in her name. And you. When she don't have a title, she's still making car payment. Like I know with my grandson. I'm the car owner of a car, but he make the car insurance payment. I forgot what they call it. I'm not the car owner title owner, but I want I'm making payments on this car. But he he he um. He paid the insurance on the car. Okay. And I forgot, but I forgot what they call it. Um. I'm kind of title owner, but I got my name. It's on the car, but he paid the insurance. Oh, it's like uh, he's he's a lien holder. Yeah, I'm the yeah I'm the lien holder, but he got he got the insurance on the car. But it's personal. I forgot what they call it. I told him the insurance man there. He told me what they call it. I forgot. Um, and I'm thinking that I could do it the same thing like that with the business insurance. Okay. Where's my mom go? Yes, ma'am. I can inquire and then give you a call back first thing tomorrow morning. Okay. Will that work? But she's not here yet. I'm just trying to get everything in place. Yes, and that's perfect because you get um get to get all the information and what you need to do before she gets here so that by the time she's here you just get it rolling. Right. Yeah. Okay, perfect. I want to get it off for next month. I have a registration of being on my separate Virginia, but DMV they told me to have the um. I think she got to get um ID where her ID in down here. Okay. That she's saying with me, she ID that down, and um, and a few from the copays gonna be sending a bill here. With my address only to her. I need to take that piece of milk, you know. When I go and get it done. All right. Yes, I will. I will look into this today and then I'll give you a call tomorrow with a better explanation or clarification on what is supposed to be done or what's needed from your side and then we can go from there. Okay then. Thank you. Anything else, ma'am? No, that'll be all. Thank you. Thank you. Have a lovely evening. You too, bye bye. Bye bye.
