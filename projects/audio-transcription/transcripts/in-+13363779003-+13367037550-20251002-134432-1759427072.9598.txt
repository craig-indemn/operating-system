Good morning, Insurance. Yes, ma'am. My name is Charlie McCon. I have called a couple times and I've called Corporate a couple times. I work at the license plate office in Walnut Cove and I've been trying to help one of my customers and one of y'all's customers and. This has been going on for like three weeks and they keep saying that they put an F S one in and it's still showing and I just want to see if I can get this fixed for him because he keeps driving here and it's still not fixed. Okay, what? What do you have a policy number? It is two nine seven zero six nine four seven zero zero. It's Byron Full. You said Full F U L P. Yes, ma'am. What's his address? Does it say on there? It is forty seven thirty six Kell Court in Walker Town. When you called him before, did you talk to anybody? Yes. Okay. Do you remember who you talked to? I don't. Um. It sounded like a young girl, but I don't remember. I don't know what their name was. And I know when I talked. I know when I called Corporate. I have talked to Alyssa Oakley twice. And you and you said you are at the license plate. The license plate office in Walnut Cove. Yeah. Okay. But this like it is got a lapse on the Explorer and. He had a Thunderbird also and he had canceled the Thunderbird because it's not running anymore. But they accidentally took the Explorer off instead of the Thunderbird. So it's they they have told me every time that they're fixing it but. I still don't have an F S one in there. Okay, so um what I'm gonna do um let me let me put you on hold to get you over to an agent. Um, hold on just a moment. Okay, now if something happens and you don't get to one, just call me right back. Okay. Okay. Hold on.
