Hello. Hey Alejandro, it's Cody. How are you? How are you, Cody? You doing good yet? Doing pretty good. I got your email that you had sent. I called Travelers. How close are you to submitting your audit documentation to them? Um, not close. I'm not close. No sir. Okay. Because basically the non compliant audit bill isn't going to go away. This 2456 non compliant audit bill. Yeah. Because right now you owe two payments plus that non compliant audit bill, so it's 442820 is the total. And 2456 of that is a non compliant audit bill. Okay, they want me to to pay that. It's going to have to get paid or the policy will end up canceling in January. Okay, but I mean would I get that money back after my? Yeah, once you complete the audit, then that fee goes away and then it's just whatever money is actually owed or to you or to the company. And then so basically you get a refund for whatever the actual amount owed was. All right. Well, if I have to pay it, then I guess I'll pay that 24 something. That way I can complete with that way I can still have the time to complete my audit, right? Yeah, because basically right now 442820 is what is due on December 17th. Wow. So it's two payments plus that non compliant audit bill. All right. Well, I'll go ahead and pay the 24 them today and then I guess by 17 they'll try to complete that other one. Do you want to just call me when you can pay it all at once? Yeah, that'll be fine. I hopefully I can if I can pay it all at once. I'm not trying to have it before the end of December. If that's okay with you. What what's the issue with the audit? Is it taxes or what tax? Yeah, it's just our taxes. Yeah, it's just the taxes. Every time we turn them in, they're asking for more information, so I have to keep. I guess I look into like my bank statements. Yeah. So I have to keep going back and forth with my bank. So that's what's also taking me. So I've been trying to keep going back and forth with them. So they're the ones that really they're really on. Basically, I'm backed up because they're going back and forth. Right. So that's what's really keeping me over right now. I got you. Yeah, yeah, just you have until the 17th, so you got nine days or whatever. If you want to just give me a call whenever before then and then I can take care of that payment and then as soon as you can do your audit, then you know you can get. Money back from it as long as money's owed to you, right? All right. Sounds good. And then and then I'm going to make sure hopefully by hopefully by this end of the month because I told you these couple these couple of other these a couple of weeks that I've been I've been going with my crew. So that's what I wanted to make sure I had I had workers on because I was going with them these couple of weeks right now. Oh, got you. Yeah, so right now by the end, hopefully by by the end of next year, I can already have the new policy with them where I'm not there. But you're just insuring them and you're not going to be included anymore. Okay. Yeah, just let me know whenever you want to make that change and we can get that done too. All right, Cody. Sounds good. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Bye.
