Hello, this Jeff. Can I help you? Hey Jeff, this is Terry with Philadelphia Insurance, and I'm returning a voicemail message you left this morning. Yeah, hey Terry. How are you today? I'm good. How are you? Well, I'm doing okay. Let me find what it was I called you about, and I know what it is. I just need to get my head around it. All right, we just became agent of record on this policy effective on Friday, I believe August 22nd. And currently, the policy is bound or the renewal is bound and it's just not been issued yet. What I was calling about was the insured is reaching out to us to see if an endorsement that was requested by the prior agency back in June has been processed. We were not the agent on it at the time, and I'm not sure what is available. The insured has sent us a little bit of email correspondence between he and the prior agent with the prior agent notifying him that he had not yet received any form of endorsement for the changes that had been requested. It would have been back around June 12th. I think that was the effective date of the endorsement request. And it was at a 5,500 square foot building. 51 South Main Street. Yeah, that is the correct address. I can confirm that. So yeah, I think we're close. Looks like maybe some additional information was needed, and that never came in. What it was requested. I hope it's a picture because it's a mile from my house. If it's more than that, and I know the I know the prior owner and I know the insured as well, so hopefully we can get what you need. Um. So we needed to confirm that there had been no losses at that location, and the and we also needed a completed winter weatherization freeze supplement. And it looks like those weren't received, so the request got closed out. But I do see a couple subsequent endorsements afterwards. Let me take a look at those and just see what those are for. Adding a vehicle. And those are all to add vehicles. So I can forward you this application or this email rather. Where they had requested additional information, and if you will just respond back to Monica Irwin who it originally came from, her email will be included in there. Great. Then they should be able to reopen an endorsement. Okay, and get that processed. Awesome. Yep, can I give you my email address? Yes, go ahead. It's Jeff J E F F at my my alliance a l l i a n c e insurance. Dot com. Okay. All right, I'll send this over to you in just a minute. Thanks for the call. I appreciate it. All right, you're welcome. Have a good one. You too. Bye bye.
