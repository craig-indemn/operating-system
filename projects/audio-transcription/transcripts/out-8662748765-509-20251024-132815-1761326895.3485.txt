Um, I was calling just to see. I had a client calling a minute ago, and I I just wanted to be sure. Um. That I am looking at this right because it's kind of confusing. It's a billing question. Can you help me out with that? Can I have the policy number? Yeah, so it's NCA one four three nine five zero. And it has in abbreviations beside the policy number. It said EX. I've never seen that before. Okay, can you verify the insured's name or property address? Yes, so it's Wallace Lane and the address is three seven one two Muddy Creek Court in Winston Salem, North Carolina two seven one zero seven. And can I have the name of the agent to call to be have one? Alliance Insurance. Okay, so I am sure we receive payment on this policy on October twenty third in amount of one thousand four hundred and ninety five dollars. Okay, so it's paid in full. Give me one second. It looks weird because, like where it shows the payment information, it says October the twenty third, but it says amount one dollar. Lock box payment. That's the part that kind of confused me. So it's um, lock box. They mailed in a check. So um, we did receive that check on the twenty third, and the system. It looks like it changed it to a two pay plan due to the partial payment. That's why it's showing. Four dollars owed. Let me go to the previous term. Okay, so it looks like a dollar was owed on the previous term due to. The paperless discount was removed. So it was a dollar owed on the previous term. So when the mortgage company sent the full amount, um. The dollar went to the twenty twenty four term and remained went to the renewal term, leaving a balance of one dollar. So um. I can request to have the pay plan fee of three dollars waived, but that dollar has to be paid first. Okay, so the dollar is from the paperless discount being removed. Is that right? Yes. Okay. All right, and so I guess so we can't waive the dollar. The the insured has to pay the dollar. Um, are they looking to be on paperless? I don't I don't really know. I mean I could call him back and ask him. Um. So we can add the paperless discount back and um it be waived. And then apply the dollar to the renewal term, but the that the the insured will like to be on paperless and they will have to accept the terms and conditions to enroll. Okay, and is that so? If he wants to accept those terms and conditions, does he just have to log into the Progressive website? And then so he will log into his account. So he will have to log into his account at progressive dot com and go to account preference. To enroll into paperless and accept the terms and conditions. Okay, account preference and then accept. You said accept terms and conditions. Yes, he will see. Like once he click on once he um goes to account preference, he's going to see pending enrollment for his paperless, and it's going to be managed in blue to where he can enroll and accept the terms and conditions. Okay, so what happens if he if if this one dollar was left on here? Would that just go towards the renewal or? Um. No, so um no. At the end of the term, would it just. Like it will do the same thing every year, like how um. The previous term was owed a dollar when they send the when they send the payment for the renewal term. Four dollars will go to the previous term and remaining amount will go to renewal. Okay. So really, um. So really, he didn't. He didn't accept the um the paperless. You said it was last term, right? Yes, and it was removed of the twenty twenty four to twenty twenty five term. Okay. Okay, all right. Very good. Well, I am going to call him. And I'll see what you know what he wants to do. But when I go to if he says he just wants if it's just easier for him to pay a dollar. When I go to I guess since it's mortgage build like I can't just take that dollar payment can I? Because
