Hey Sean, this is JC. How are you? Hey, sorry for playing phone tag. Oh no, you're fine. I left. Yeah, go ahead. Okay, I have some questions. So I have a payment due with Penn National or whoever it is Penn. Yeah, Penn National tomorrow. Of two thousand four dollars and sixty seven cents, and that has the Jetta and the Mini on it. Do I pay that and then wait for them to issue me another bill with? You know, removing the Mini and adding the Frontier. How do I do this? So I left you a voicemail letting you know that you were working with Heather on this. I was going to try to help as much as possible. So let me see what I can do on my end. With that new policy, but I'm going to assume ever since the accident you haven't been in touch with Heather. Well, I have been, but she's she's always referred me to you and she's she's been out of town. I think this week or something. She's. Yeah, no problem, and I'm happy to help. I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page since I wasn't helping you with this. I don't want there to be any hiccups or anything with the process of opening opening up a new policy. So let me just see. I had just mentioned to her that you you called and. Yeah. So policy was. That's okay. The policy was bound, and I believe she said just to leave it alone until everything settles. But I mean, the payments due tomorrow. I don't know what to do. I don't want to be late. Okay, and that's a good question to have. Yeah. Yeah, and and Safeco should be canceled tomorrow. And I see there's a big bill due with them too. They think I'm renewing with them for some reason. We've. You received a bill. It's online on my Safeco app. Yeah. Okay. I'm thinking that that might be for for the new car. For the new. Well, yeah, it's got the new car and the Jetta, and it's for next year. So it's for. Oh okay. It's just the renewal. Okay, yeah, that's just the renewal information. They they send it out. I wouldn't worry about that. I am looking at the new policy. How much did you say the payment was? Two thousand four dollars and sixty seven cents due tomorrow. Let me see if I can get in touch with her. Because I want to make sure that the information is still correct that she gave you. When was the last time that you spoke to her by chance? Let me see my email here. Tuesday, she said, "I'm out of town this week. Let's feel free to call the office." Also, I think there were a few other changes while I was out a few weeks ago, like adding a new vehicle and taking off the Mini. It's probably best to let all of that finish processing first. Once it does, Safeco will send you the final bill. Okay, so we're letting all that process with Safeco. Let me. I think I know what we're supposed to do here, but I just want to clarify with another agent. But I'm thinking we need to add the new vehicle and remove. The vehicle that was involved in an accident because we don't we're not looking to insure that vehicle. Right, that and that vehicle has been removed from the Safeco policy. Yes, yes, okay. All right. Well, let me just double check everything in the system. I understand she's out of the office this week, but I want to make sure again that everything is processed correctly. And with. The new vehicle, like I said, I'm thinking we need to go ahead and add it before before. The policy takes effect tomorrow. Yeah, that's right. I wouldn't worry too much about the payment. I will go. I would go ahead and process it. And the only reason why I say that is because they're going to need that payment to process the policy to have it active. And then the rest, as far as the adjustments that are going to be made to the policy with switching the vehicles, I don't know that that's going to be updated in time. To be able to process billing for the new vehicle, but I'm not sure. I'll keep you updated. I'll let you know as soon as I. Have an answer for you, and of course it'll be today. Just let me get some clarification on this. You do want me to go ahead and pay this then. Yes, because otherwise the policy is not going to. It's not going to process for tomorrow. It's it's it does need that payment, but before you do anything, let me just get clarification and see
