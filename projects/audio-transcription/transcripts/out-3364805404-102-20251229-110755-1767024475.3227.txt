Hello. Hi, good morning. This is Gloria calling from Alliance Insurance. How are you doing, ma'am? Hey, good Gloria. How are you? I'm doing great. Thank you for asking. How was your holiday? It was great. What information did you need for our insurance? So we are we are trying to get you to a different carrier for your professional liability insurance coming policy term and I sent you in a um an application that the carrier sent in for us to get the information from you and then they will be able to get us a quote for the renewal. Why am I switching? So what we are doing is the previous insurance carrier is not the standard carrier. It's like a broker. So we are switching for one for just better in hoping of better premium and another reason is trying to get you to move you from a brokerage to a standard carrier. I don't know what that means. I'm trying to find a simpler language. So like right now your policy is what we call Hannover Insurance Group. Those are known as brokers. They are not like they are not known like traveler like the rest of your policies are what they they are with travelers insurance those are standard carriers standard carriers are. Let me let me try and get you a different. Is that for the ENO insurance? Yes, ma'am. Let me see. I'm trying to get a better um the the the better understanding so I can explain to you why we are attempting to move this. And once we are able to move this, so instead of the carrier having to send all the communication about your policy to us and for us to communicate to you, you can actually be able to go online and be able to access the documents whenever you need them without you having to reach out to the agency. Let's say you want to review your bills, you can easily go on the carrier. So we have this carrier called Cincinnati. Cincinnati they have the client portal online. You can easily view all your documentation. You can view you can call their customer services as well if you want to reach out to them. Makes it easier on you. Is that right? Yes, ma'am. It makes it easier on us and it makes it easier on you and then instead of having to fill this application every year, you don't have to keep on repeating doing the same thing because you've been I see you've been having to send in application every year but this one will be like a one time kind of thing and then they have everything set. You know what we actually don't need ENO insurance anymore. I was going to reach out about that. Oh, you can cancel ENO insurance. We don't need that. We've got it through Exe. And also, did my car insurance get canceled on the Audi that I've been calling and telling about? Yes, ma'am. I did. I did remove that from your policy and I sent in a communication. Maybe it didn't get to you, but it was processed. Do I have a refund coming? I can um I can request. Did you because I mean we we just we just want to remove that one car right we are not canceling the entire policy. Just that one car and I do want a refund of course. So let me let me pull up the. I sold that car back in. When did I? I sold that car like three months ago. Okay, let me see. So on July 11th, it's when we received an email from you requesting to remove the Audi from your policy and it was processed. Yeah, I want to I want a refund on what I've paid for. They don't get to just keep my money. Okay, let me let me reach out to the carrier and find out so that they can give me a a breakdown of the billing billing cycle for this policy and when they remove the vehicle if there is any refund on with that and then I can get back to you and communicate the information. Okay, that's fine. Cancel the ENO. We don't need it. All right. Okay. Okay. No, that's it. Thank you. All right. Thank you so much. You have a wonderful day. All right. Bye bye.
