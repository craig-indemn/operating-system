Thanks for holding us, Gary. Hey Gary, it's Jake Paul, buddy. Hey there. Hey, oh. I didn't have anything. Let me look one more time, but I was just going to touch base with you some days off work. I was actually called. Gary Belcher, at you. Yeah, that's me. I do have an email. Did you get everything straightened out where? Hey, I was in. Oh yeah, yeah, I think that was just some miscommunication there. Now that homeowner's quote we we needed we need the information on the roof. Do you know when the roof was replaced last? The house or the shop. On the house. On the house, probably ten years ago. Okay. The shop is like a year and a half old. I'll see it. Okay. It's got a brand new roof on the sheet. Okay. And then what about the driving records? What they still good? Yes, I would like to take two of these vehicles off the policy there. Yeah, you need to take them off now or you you want to do it once once it renews. I can't it doesn't renew till next month, right? Right, or whenever we take it off right now and then it kicks in next month. That'll be fine. Have you turned the tags in on the cars? The Astro van has been turned in and the Ford, yeah, the Explorer. Both of them have been turned in. Okay, so the Astro van and which one? The Ford Explorer. Okay. The Astro van has been broke down for a while. Okay. Okay. So if I'm reading this right, it's the 205 a month with all the vehicles on there. That's with all of them on there. So if we if we need to make some adjustments on there, you know we certainly can. So. Let me get these off there first, off of your current policy. And and then we can adjust those quotes and then I'll be back in touch with you on that to let you know. Because it will it will be you know substantially less than that once we take those two cars off there. Right, and as far as the house, I know you said it. Is that pretty similar to what I currently have? It's it's actually the coverage amount looks to be a little bit more than what you had before. But the company is going to use based on square footage they're going to use the replacement value to calculate that. I got you. And I can call you back first of the week and we can get some adjustments on on the auto rates too and then just go from there. All right. Yeah, because we got plenty of time to get it done. I got you. I know the the auto insurance looks a lot better. I was getting pretty. I was ready. I was not going with progressive anyway. Yeah, yeah. They keep they keep the past two years. They keep going up on when at any points or anything. Yeah. Yeah. Well, hopefully we got that straightened out for a while. Yeah, not that 205 and whatever we see on the other two vehicles. That's I'm good with that. Okay, well let me let me do these adjustments on there and then I will. Now you work until three every day. I should be around tomorrow being Saturday, but here in the week. Yeah, three o'clock is normal when I get off. Yeah, then I'll just wait until Monday and call you back. I think I'm happy three. I'll pick up, buddy. Okay, good deal. All right, thanks, sir. Thank you. Bye.
