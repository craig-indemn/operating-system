Good morning, Alliance Insurance. Hi, I'm calling with a question. I'm coming to bring you a cashier's check for a policy, and it should be made payable to Foremost Insurance. Can I do that and then just drop it off with you or? You can. What office are you going to? The one, well, which one should I go to? I'm gonna go to one on University. Okay, so if that one's close closer for you, yeah, you can definitely do that. You can bring a cashier's check to that office. Is it one on Collins Creek better? I can come there too, which doesn't matter. Well, we only have one office in Winston Salem, and that's the one by the Sam's by the Sam Club. You should have two. Okay, I didn't know. Well, we have we actually have maybe even five. We have one in Walnut Cove, one in Clemens, and Mount Airy and Pilot Mountain. So we have several. So that's why I was asking which one are you going to. So I'll send a message to the Winston Salem group and let them know which policy you're paying. You said the is it the the Foremost you said. Yeah, uh-huh. Okay, all right. So I'll send them a message and let them know that you're coming by with a payment. Okay, and I make it payable to Foremost or Alliance. Well, you probably want to have you done the cashier's check yet. Have you? No, on my way. You probably want to do it to Alliance Insurance because they're gonna deposit it into their bank account. Okay, it's due to that. Just gonna make sure it it'll it'll still work. Now if you want instead you have to do those extra steps. I mean I can go on here and I can post your payment for you. So you don't have to do the whole cashier's check. If you want to just use our routing and account number, we can do a payment over the phone. It's up to you. Oh well, I'm on my cell phone. I don't I don't like to do stuff like that. On my cell phone, if I would have, I might do that. Yeah, okay, that's fine. I will let them know. Yeah. Okay, so I'll make it payable to Alliance, and that will cover my. It won't be later anything. Uh no no. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Bye bye.
