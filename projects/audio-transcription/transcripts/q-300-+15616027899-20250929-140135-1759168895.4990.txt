Thanks for holding, Miss Gary. Hi Gary, um, I am trying to cancel my car insurance. Um, I talked to someone earlier and they said that they would send me something and I would just have to click it and sign it. And I did get an email, but it's bringing me to my account. And I've been all over my account. I cannot figure out what I am supposed to sign or what I am supposed to do to cancel this insurance. What is your name, ma'am? My name is Amber Todd Guy.

Ma'am, I do see where Brandi had sent that to you. Yes. Uh, are you having problems opening it or? No. The email I didn't. I am in my account, so I am on the email right now. It says policy change. It changes the major insurance policy, and then I click view. When I go over to view, it has me log in, and I've logged in. I am in my account right now, and I don't know what I am supposed to do to cancel it. I clicked every button I could possibly find, and I have no idea what I am supposed to do to cancel this. Okay, now the email that came from Brandi, it would not be in your account. It's going to come through your email address. Okay, so then she never sent it. I have a, I didn't get anything from her from that. The only thing I got was from a National General insurance, and then she she did also send me. Um, sent me another email that had the link to my home insurance because that was another thing I asked her is my home insurance was showing. And I click on that and it brought me again to my account and now my home insurance was showing. But that's the only emails I received. I didn't receive anything else. Okay, let me just check one other place here because it's showing on it's showing on our system that the email was sent. Um, I want to check and make sure she sent it to the right email address. Yeah, I mean I got the others. That's why I figured they would be. New device login. Would it have been from National General or from you? It would have come from a place. That's described as cognizant. It's it's similar to a docu sign document. Okay, yes, so no, I am in my all mail right now and there is nothing. Okay, let me resend it to you. Let me look in the spam maybe in the spam hold on. Okay. Delivery system Costa uh uh uh no I don't see anything. Let me look in trash maybe it somehow got there. No, a glove box. No, that was from somewhere else. Oh wait, here is a Brandi. Hold on, hold on, here it is. Yep. I found it. Was in my spam. That's okay. Clear signature. Okay, cognizant. That's it. Yeah, just follow the directions on that and electronically sign, hit complete, and it comes back to us and we can get that process for you. Okay, yeah, that's like. What you are telling me? It sounds like National General has already canceled it. I don't think so. Well, I don't. She would do it for you maybe. I don't. She said she would do it after this because I am freaking out. I didn't realize it was on a renewal schedule. Um, so I am kind of freaking out because I will just die if they take all that money out of my account right now because I am broke. Um. See here. So I am in I am in the national. Hold on, I am finishing this one. I am in the National General stuff right now. And um, it's still showing it and it's showing as my auto my auto my renewed policy is going to begin ten one twenty twenty five. Correct. So that's what I want to get rid of. Okay, so you send that you send that back to me. Okay, I just did. And I will let me see, shows up here a minute. And I will go in there and cancel the policy manually. All
