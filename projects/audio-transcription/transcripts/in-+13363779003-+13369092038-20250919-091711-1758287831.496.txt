Good morning, Alliance Insurance. Oh yes, ma'am, I'm trying to get in touch with Holly or someone. I left a message, a text message, last night, and I called this morning. And well, I talked with Holly and I don't have. I'd have to look back at the text message three weeks ago, and they were to send the FS1 over to the DMV. Okay. So that the registration wouldn't go out, but now we've got another mailer saying that the registration is out, and that my son he he's up in Western Carolina at school and he needs to go to class this morning, but his registration for his vehicles are revoked. And so I'm trying my best to get the FS1 sent to the DMV so that my son's insurance the insurance valid because I've checked and it's been drafting from my credit card every month. Okay. But the FS1 is not going to Raleigh. I've confirmed that the VIN numbers are correct. On the information that Raleigh is sending me or the DMV and the VIN numbers on the title, so I know that portions right. That's what the lady at the DMV told me to check this morning. Okay. But she said that they did not receive the FS1, and it. All right. I mean to me it's uh to me it's very important that I get this done because he doesn't have a vehicle to drive and he's three hours away and it's very anxiety provoking for me for something that I can't control. Well, that's what I was told before, so so I don't know what I need to do. Well, let me stop you because I'm not the one that can do the FS1. So let me get over somebody that can okay. Hold on a moment.
