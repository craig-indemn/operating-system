Jeff, good afternoon. This is Steve Waller from USL. I how you doing? I'm doing great. How are you, Steve? Good, good. I'm giving you a call. Looks like you left the voicemail for Holly Coons. She's one of the guys on my team. So I'm giving you a call. She out of the office today, so I figured I'd reach out to I guess get the information you were looking to forward over for. Trs business LLC. Correct, and I apologize. I left the voicemail and then left the office. That's about as rude as somebody can be. All right, so I am not at my desk. What I was hoping to do, I spoke with the insured, and basically the renovations that he was planning to do when he first. Bought the building and we first took out the policy. Have kind of been put on hold, and he is still planning to do it. He's just not completely sure when he is going to be able to get started. Okay, um, so I wanted to share that part with Holly and also. She had mentioned you know we sent in the endorsement request to add the building coverage that we originally had quoted when we took out the general liability policy and Holly's expressed some concerns that we're. Not looking at putting enough coverage on that building based on the square footage. Okay. At the same time, you know we sent in an appraisal to kind of what we thought might verify what we were asking as far as the amount of coverage. And she did not accept the appraisal, but has not really offered what she would like to see us do as far as an amount of coverage on that building. So I was kind of want to just. Talk with her a little bit and just see kind of you know where are we short, how short are we, what would you know what would be acceptable, what could we, what could we do. Okay, let me let me take a look at what we have in the file. Great if you don't mind, just bear with me for a second. I probably should have looked into this before I called it, but I wasn't sure what I. Well, I might have exactly, and I might have offered you a little more than you anticipated when you called me back, and I appreciate I appreciate you calling me back. Absolutely no problem. All right, so let me open the underlying file here for GL. One two eight eight three five three two one three five five two. There we go. All right, let's see what the communication. All right, so it looks like she's saying the building at three hundred thousand dollars and six thousand fifty square feet appears to be undervalued. And we cannot provide a quote at this time. So let me just get a just a quick calculation. Just so I'm. So it's about forty nine dollars and fifty cents per square foot. And then I think in response to that, I sent the an appraisal that was done. In March, shortly after or maybe shortly before, I don't remember exactly. Our insured bought the building. That shows an as is value, I think of three hundred thirty thousand. With once renovations were done, I think he's showing the value of five hundred and fifty thousand. I think those figures are right, and so I sent that to Holly and she basically replied that she was not able to accept the appraisal. So that's kind of where I was coming back at her. You know, sure, just yeah. Let me know more about what you're looking for. Where is this? Where is our asking value coming up short? What would you like to see? Just kind of see where we could maybe get together at some point. And the the appraisal that you sent her that's what that's what you sent recently. Yes, I sent it this week. It was it's in response to the email that you just read back to me. All right, let me see if I can find the actual appraisal here. Then maybe this is it. All right, now that's our quote. Expert. All right, here we go. Got had the appraisal now. Sure. And just and just so I'm clear from my own, again I'm coming coming into this. As exact, so we've got a partially occupied building that's going to be undergoing renovation. Correct. Correct. Yep. All right. And it's about if if my numbers are right, I'm thinking roughly twenty four to twenty six hundred square feet of the six thousand fifty square feet. Is currently occupied. Right, exactly. Yeah, that that's what we have here. And the the portion of the building that's undergoing renovation is completely closed off from the occupied portion of the building. Correct. Correct. That is correct. All right, yep. All right, just want to make sure that we have that accurate as well. So here's here's where I think in
