Hello, this Jeff, can I help you? Hey Jeff, Dale Faulk here. Hey Dale. Good morning. How are you? Good, I got those email of Docy signs. Yeah, I've signed it now on this, on this amount eight six six oh eight eighty. Yeah, how how do I get that to you? Do I need to drop you a check by the office or? No, do you want to pay it in full? Is that how you want to do it? Yeah, yeah, I just want to take care of it. But that's the total amount, right? That's the total amount from what they gave me on the liability portion and basically the process is we give them binding request and then they will generate the billing and let us know how that needs to be taken care of they will bill you actually directly the billing will be between you and Cincinnati Specialty so that you know I can let you know how that needs to be set up but I just need the documents that you got e-signed and returned to me and then I'll forward them to CSU and that will get the policy in force and then the rest of it will kind of go from there well I've signed them both I guess you got them let me see hang on one second just this item that said it's complete okay it may take a little bit to get to me then so you've signed both of them I'll be on the lookout for them if I don't get them here in the next little bit I'll holler back at you or I'll resend them but it shows that they were viewed I do see that nine thirty eight and nine forty two it's just the signed part of that has just not gotten back to me yet so once I get those I'll get the binding order started and if I have any issues I'll let you know and we'll you know we'll go from there there we go it just came I thought if I talked long enough it might show up and they just popped in to me so I'll go ahead and get it bound and let you know what we need to do next very good all right thanks Dale appreciate it bye okay.
