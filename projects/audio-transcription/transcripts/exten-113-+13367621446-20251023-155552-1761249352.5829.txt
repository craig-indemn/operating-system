My goodness, ladies, where have you been? Gary, you dropped me like a bad habit. I knew you was going to retire. So I called all those people over there. They made me think that you had moved to Hawaii. You had all these policies they didn't know nothing about. They were they were happy to see me go, Pam. Wow, they did they wouldn't act nice and not been that helpful. Um, it happened quick, but but it worked out for the best. Um. I was calling because I wanted to make sure that you had your stuff taken care of and if not. Um, did you get the non renewal from Northwest? No, I called all them people myself because I knew it was going to end. Um, because my mortgage company had let me know so I handled all of that myself. And I reached out to somebody else to go ahead and get my homeowner so I got it all taken care of, Gary. Okay, so you're good on everything, right? I am. I had to get car insurance and everything. I moved everything. Yeah, I'm sorry, honey. I'm I'm I'm working for another guy here in Winston now. But there again, if you're straightened out, then that's the main thing because I'm not planning on being here but maybe six or eight more months. Oh, okay, that's good. I'm good then. If you're not going to say, I found a young man. That's he's independent agent as well. So who is it? Can I ask you that? Oh yeah, I don't mind you asking. I got friends that are mortgage they they buy they sell houses they in reaching mortgages. So I asked one of my friends at my church who does the stuff for them. Maybe their his name is Tyler Goosehead or something. I don't even think he's local. But this young man named Tyler. Oh, but I'm with colonial life. Everything went up, Gary. Because the taxes on my house went up. I know, and so it's it's just ridiculous. And so your people wouldn't even work with me. They quoted me one thousand eight hundred something dollars. I told them that's ridiculous. Well, it's you know, I'm I'm still doing basically the same thing, but what I found is the same thing you're talking about. Everything is just just crazy right now. So I got it a whole lot cheaper than that and. A whole like eight hundred dollars cheaper than that. It was just ridiculous. But nevertheless, had I known though what was going on and you had called before I started. But they didn't seem to know anything. Had I had known and had a number for you or whatever I would have. I would have waited, but or called or. No, no, no, ma'am. You don't need on something like that. You don't need to wait. I was just taking a chance that you hadn't done anything yet. Oh, lord, no, no, no, but in any event, you know I know inside of a year I'm going to be completely finished. Well, do it, Gary. Don't don't do it. I'm glad you didn't have to move to Greensboro. They didn't seem to be happy. They all stressed out. Well, no, I mean I I drove that for two months and I just. No, you did it. I did. I can't take it anymore. I couldn't take it anymore. And and I left. Wow, wow, that's a lot. I've been retired. I retired in June, like I told you. We worked for nobody else. Fall to T and China. I'm done. Well, when I talked to you last, you were thinking about it or getting ready to. And then in July is when they moved us. I knew about the first about the first part of July. Well, after the fourth of July, they moved us and I worked over there about six weeks. And I just went in and told them, you know, I'm I'm not drive I have to drive two and a half hours a day just to get to work. Yeah, that traffic. It took me an hour to an hour fifteen minutes to get home and get to work in the morning. Oh, lord, no, nobody's doing that at our age. We don't need to do that. And I live and I live forty miles away from Greensboro and it takes me an hour and fifteen minutes to get to work. I'm not going to do it. No, we don't have to do it. So I found I found another agency here that treated me real good and they offered me a position and they knew they knew what my deal was coming in that I didn't plan on working a lot longer and they needed the help and I wanted something to do. I got you. Well
