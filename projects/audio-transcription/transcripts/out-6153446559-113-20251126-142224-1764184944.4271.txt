This is Richard. Hey Richard, this is Gary. I'm sorry. Hey Gary. I'm sorry this has been such an ordeal, but it happens. They pretty much tie our hands in this in this kind of situation. They make that they make that statement so arbitrary that you can't hardly get around it. Yeah, I mean it's kind of understandable, but at the same time, you know this was clearly not an intentional lapse in coverage for me. I had no idea, and I've been a customer there for a long time. But you know again that's not y'all's fault. That's their policy is not yours. So it is what it is. Okay, let me ask you just a question here. Do you want do you want to be billed for this or do you want an automatic payment or how do you want to do that? Yeah, automatic is fine, and it was on automatic. The problem was, so you know not the going to everything, but my son was diagnosed with bone cancer about two years ago. And when he was in chemo, my wife had left, so it was just me and the kids. So when he was in chemo, I took off work for five months without pay. And it's got us you know way behind, and it's it's like gotten worse over time, just because I racked up a lot of you know loans and credit card bills while he was in the hospital. And so at the end of each month, I was running out of money, and what the bank was doing was they were covering them and just charging me a fee. Well, apparently last month they didn't cover it, and I didn't know that. They still charged me the fee, but they didn't cover the interest payment. So it had been coming out every month automatically, and I thought it had still come out because like I said the the bank or the credit union had just been covering it and then charging me extra. Now I finally got some money together, and things are better, but you know, little too little, little too late. But yeah, so I mean I definitely want it automatic, and it shouldn't be a problem going forward. It just happened to be a problem at the wrong time. Let me just change the billing system here. Just working through some screens here. So just spare with me just a minute. Yeah, no problem. Okay, now let me ask you this: that on the on the down payment, they're asking for a card, a debit card or whatever. Yeah. And then I'm going to put your bank information in here so we can start that auto draft. Is that okay? Okay. Yeah, that's fine. So let me get the debit card first, please. Sure. Yeah, the debit card number is four zero five six. Mhm. One zero one zero. Zero five six seven. Zero three six zero. And the expiration. Yep, is o seven of twenty eight. Okay. And what's the zip code for that card? Two seven zero five two. Okay. And then that card information, Richard. I mean bank account information, please. Yep, sure. The routing number is two five three. Mhm. One seven seven. Eight three two. Okay. And the account number is four zero zero zero. Six zero one. Eight zero four. Four eight. Four eight. Okay. Um and that accounts in your name. Yes. And I will go ahead and get that input here as soon as we hang up. Okay. And the documents are going to come to you by e signature and they're going to come from Progressive, so you need to be on the lookout for that. Okay. Okay. Yep, I'll be sitting here waiting. And then all of your insurance cards and everything should be in there, so you should be you should be good to go. Okay, great. Very good. Very much for your help. No worries. Just let us know if if you need anything else. Okay. All right, sounds good. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good weekend. Thanks you too and happy Thanksgiving.
