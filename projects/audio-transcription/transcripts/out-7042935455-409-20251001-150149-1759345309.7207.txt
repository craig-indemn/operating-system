Hello. Okay, I think I got you now. Um. And what, what was I think the premium went a lot too unfortunately but what was the price I quoted you what you read it to me. Uh thirty four fifty with seventeen point five a month. Yeah went up some. The question I have is like is it telling you you need to file anything with North Carolina I didn't hear anything. I wonder if I should leave that off. No it didn't it didn't tell me it didn't tell me about anything filing with North Carolina it's just. They need to pretty much they need to have proof that I got, um I got insurance on the truck you know I'm saying uh. Like because. Federal. Yeah yeah yeah federal like I got I you know I'm able to operate. You know I'm saying like I can operate with insurance so. And do you have any other vehicles in the business name? Just the. No. No just just that just that one truck. Okay. Again. Let me see if that if I remove the state filing. Let's see if that helps you a little bit. Not really. All right, so. So making this make doing those filings, um. It's going to be. Billing plan. Oh it's actually, right on it thirty four forty nine nineteen down. And then ten ten payments of seventeen oh seven sixty nine. It's got to be on auto pay. Okay. Only two dollars higher but. Oh yeah I mean that's that's fine you know I'm saying well you're showing that I got I got that because uh. Uh that should be another one and then it's another piece of paper. Uh. It's something else that uh. Something that it's something else that I forgot the name of that paper but uh. But as long as I got insurance and you can send it over to me then once I reach out to her tomorrow in the morning. And uh because I'm gonna send everything via to her when we finish up today you know they'll let her see it so they can finish up with my MC number and everything. Very um you know I'd be good you know yeah yeah yeah. Okay so let's go ahead and finish it up then. Okay. Yeah and I'll be able to show the DMV that I got proof of insurance too as well. Would you send me anything in the mail you know proof of insurance card and all that stuff. Everything is probably going to be electronic but I can ask them to send you something whatever you need. All in the mail to you. Yeah I want to electronically and part copies. We don't need to do additional insurance endorsements. No right now. No no no no no. So we'll just go right into the payments. So picked up an accident shoot. No I remember we talked about that it I didn't know who's. That was an all I don't understand. That's not easy. All right let me see if I get that changed here. So this is driver not at fault. Cause cause of incident. Whether caused by equipment failure other driver was cited rear ended victim of hit and run hit an animal other reason not listed. Tell me what happened again hit and run probably whatever yeah whatever this is this is all separate filings right. Yes. This insurance this truck that that I don't know how that happened but I guess I don't know I guess that's something you probably looking at with my mom I guess. You know I'm saying when. Oh yeah but that wasn't that wasn't me you know I'm saying. I would say that was not not yours not your accident was your mom's on eleven twenty eight twenty three. Yeah. Um. Yeah I just want to make sure although this is separate this is not going to be my truck and the cars is not going to be the same. It is it is I just have to when I tell them it's a not at fault I just got to give them the reason. So so so so so I don't want the truck and the vehicles on same insurance you know. Yeah they're not they're not I'm I'm in the part where it's asking for the accident like they don't charge you more I'm trying to. Okay. Otherwise it would charge you as an at fault accident and the rate would go up so I'm just. Tell them then you were not at fault other reason not listed and then we're going to say this is. Someone else not yours sure. Uh huh. This is not his accident. Okay that'll. You won't ask me for more stuff, but if we need to get more documentation we can get out right. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah push come show yeah. Okay. I just want to make sure this is going to be separate. Like I'm paying this seventeen seventeen oh seven a month by itself in my account.
