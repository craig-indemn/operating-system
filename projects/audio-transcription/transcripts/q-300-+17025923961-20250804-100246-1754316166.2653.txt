Thank you for holding. This is Jacey. How may I help you? Yes, I wanted to speak to someone about my the renewal on my upcoming auto policy. All right. May I have your name, please? Jacqueline Thornhill. Give me one second. Let me pull up that account. And if you don't mind, just confirming your address for me, please. One six five Virginia Street Suite Four O Nine Mount Airy North Carolina Two Seven Zero Two Zero. All right. Thank you very much. All right. So it looks like the renewal is coming up in September. How can I help you? Well, I see. It's pretty high in my opinion. I don't have accidents. I don't have tickets. I mean, what can we do? I can afford higher deductibles. If there's any way, we can drop this down a little bit so that I don't have to search around. I would appreciate it. Yeah, okay. Let me take a look at your account here. And if I'm paying for roadside service, I have two others. I don't need to pay extra for that. Okay. Okay, so it looks like right now that deductible for the comprehensive is at one hundred dollars. You said you can afford to go up on the deductible. If it if it's a significant reduction or reasonable reduction, yeah. Okay. So let me just try to quote the five hundred and then you do have towing and rental on that vehicle. Okay. Um. Well, I don't have I don't have rental coverage with my other I only have towing and that kind of stuff. Okay, so the rental would only be you would only be able to use the rental if like you were to get into an accident with this specific vehicle. Yeah, I understand that's the only car I've got. So um. Okay. Okay. So leave those on there. Well, I mean, is that going to? I didn't I didn't even look to see what the premium was on that, but I do have free towing and everything with my Mercedes. Always have and I have AAA as a backup. Okay. So do you want to remove the towing? We can keep the towing. Yeah. Because I can always get it towed. Okay, and then right now, like I was saying, the comprehensive was at one hundred, so I'm changing that to five hundred. And then we've just removed the towing, so we can take a look at. Okay. So it looks like that's only going to decrease it by a hundred and two dollars. Making those changes. What about the increasing the deductible on the collision? Okay, let's take a look at that. So the collision is currently at five hundred dollars. We can take a look at a thousand dollars, and that's our only other option. Okay. So it looks like that would decrease one hundred and eighty dollars. But the total decrease of one eighty. That is correct. Yes. Okay, that's that's better than nothing. So let's go with that. Okay. All right, I'll go ahead and process this change. All right. Appreciate your help. Thank you. Okay, I'm sorry. Absolutely. No, no, that that was all. Um, just wanted to say that I'll go ahead and process the change. It is going to take about twenty four hours for billing to update. So if you don't if you don't see that change effective immediately, it is going to come in place for the renewal. But that was all. All right. Appreciate your help. Thank you so much. Absolutely. Thank you. Have a wonderful day. You as well. Bye bye. Thank you.
