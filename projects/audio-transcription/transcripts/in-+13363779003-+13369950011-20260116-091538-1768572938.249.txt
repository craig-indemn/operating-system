Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hey, good morning. How are you? I'm doing good. And you? I'm great. My name is Bertella Gabbard, and I'm calling to inquire about life insurance for me and my mother. Okay, I don't have an agent available at the moment. I can get one to call you back if that's okay. Um, I was going to actually come in once I left work, if that was fine. I don't have an agent in office. Oh okay okay okay. I can get one to call you and then they can. That's fine. No problem. Okay.
