Hello, this is Tanya calling you back. Hey Tanya, how are you? I'm good. Are you doing good? Yes, we are like getting down to finalizing everything up. So we've got two carriers that we're looking at, and I need to go over each property with you just to confirm a few things. Okay. So for the 538 Slate Road, do you know the the year that roof was replaced? No, my husband was trying to figure up on all those and he said about 10 years for all of them. Yeah, replaced. Well, now just just the it's 192 and and then the rental. The other ones the 180 is a mobile home. Yes, yeah. So so 538 Slate Road, you think it's 10 years old? It's at least at least 10 years. Yeah. Okay. And they got that cotton. I'm not sure if I sent you that. I thought I told somebody it was the 30 year. Let's be the better ones, you know I'm saying. Like the architectural 30 year. Yes. Okay, and that's on all of them. Yes. Okay. All right. So we've got that's all I needed on 538 was the the roof age. See, and you said at least 10 years. All right, and then 192 the same. Yes. 192. Yeah, I got. I every time I hear that, I think that yeah, there's a mobile home and a house. It is. I know. Yes, so the 192 is the dwelling, and then the other one is the home. And you've got tenants in all these properties, right? Yeah, someone okay. So for the mobile home, it's 180. The address is pulling up 180 McBride. Yes. Um. Now is that a metal roof or single? It's whatever they come with factory. Okay. So I whatever. Okay, I need I need that information like the manufacturer, the model, serial number, dimensions. Have you got anything on that? For the double wide. It's a single wide. I would probably have to pull the title. They're saying it's a double wide. Uh huh. Okay. No. Actually, it's not it's not big at all. I don't know where they got that at. It's double. I know it's by Kirkland. But I can't remember the year. I have to. I'm on my lunch. Okay, I'll have to pull the title. Okay. If you can email me that. That'll be great. Yes, if you can email me that you got my email about you. Yes, it and it might be tonight before I can get to that. Is that okay? Okay. Yeah. So everything on there is original, nothing's been replaced or renovated. Because God it was built in 1990. Well, I mean, now we did put down floors new flooring and I mean like hardwood like the how you call that. It's not real wood, but it's the snap and lock laminate. Yes. Yeah, I put that down and painted. And what kind of underpinning does it have? Like starting like is it. It's just a regular vinyl, I guess. Okay. A vinyl starting around the bottom. Okay. All right. Yeah, I'll just need the manufacturer, dimensions, serial number, that type thing. Okay. For that, it should be on my on my on the title. I'm pretty sure it should. Okay. All right, and then you've got a farm policy. And they were asking about that. So one shows 40 acres, and then where you're at your property is 18 acres 18.8. Is this all tied together? The 40 and the 18 acres of land. Well, it's like we have the the 18 and then. Where the property and your primary residence is. Yes. Yes. Okay. And then there's like some land behind the barn there, but we don't have it fenced in yet. Um and then the his daddy has a a lot that joins ours. I don't know if that's what they have it on or not. I need to ask Lane because I think the 18 plus the behind the barn would would be. I think it's it's about 18 too. So. Yeah, showing 18.8 on your land. I mean, where the home. And then had. The barn and behind. Well, and behind the barn is another. It's it's Peter Cotton Trail. There's land there. That's Peter Cotton Trail as the name of it. Uh huh. Okay. And then his dad All right, and you said it is a center block building. Okay. And it's for cars, right? It's for Bay Garage. Yes. Uh huh. Is it heated? Yes. It is heated. Okay. I mean we don't heat it all the time, but when we heat it, we do have have a. Right. Yeah. Yeah, there's electric. It's heated and everything else is. All right. Um. What type of roof does it have? Is it a metal or shingle roof on the house? I'm pretty sure it's the same thing. Yeah. This is shingle. Same thing we got on right now. Okay. All right. Okay. And there is a mortgage on this one, right? Surety Bank and Trust. No mortgage on anything but our our home. That's that's a separate lot. It's that lot out there is. I pretty sure it's a separate slot. Or zone. I mean, I guess that's how you say it. Um. The loan. The only thing we have is on two five one Oldrich Road and it's like fifty six hundred as we speak. Yeah, but it's through Surety Surety Bank. Surety Bank and Trust. Yeah. Yeah, we can now. Is it first family now? Yeah. Oh, has that changed? Okay. Yeah, changed. But I mean, uh, yeah, it has. That's our new bank. We have our same new same account numbers and everything, but uh. All right. The three three six seven eight six one one three three. I can't text it to that, can I? That's the that's true. Yeah, the one I just the one I just texted you on. Did you get my text? You can text it right back. It says three three six seven eight six one one three three. That sounds like a regular sign, but would that work? Yes. Or it sounds the one that. Yeah, if I texted you to that, just just reply back to that one. Okay. Because I texted you this morning. Try that and you see if if for some reason you don't. I'm sending that. Okay. Now, some reason you don't receive that. Let me know and I'll resend a different. Yeah, it should. It should. If it's the same one, if you're just on that same tag. Okay. So that's the only mortgage that you have, right? It's on your primary home. Yeah, and that's like other. It's called a line of credit. Okay. Yeah. So do you. So do you pay for all of these then? They're not none of the credit fraud. You you pay the premium on the policy. Yeah, I don't have anything due right now. Like it might be a payment coming up, but I don't have anything due. No, I'm just saying that it's not escrow or anything like that. Oh no. The lender. No. Yeah, we got paid. Okay. Yeah, the only thing I would it's really not a mortgage, but it's a equity line of credit on the house. So I feel like you know that would probably. Guess count. I mean, we don't have any mortgage. I do have the equity line on two five one. Okay. All right. Yep, I got it. Okay. Let me make sure I can open it. That and I mean that's all I have. You need something else. I guess I have to go and see if I can find it. But you know, that's all we have. It's a title. All right. Yeah. The only thing it don't show is the dimensions. Would you know what the dimensions are? No, I'd have to ask my husband. I mean, it's small. It's not big at all. And it's definitely a single one. Uh huh. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's like a two bedroom, one bath, kitchen living room. You know I'm saying. Uh huh. Yeah. So they. I don't know if they got it from the. I don't know. Um. If it was on the policy recently. Or on the tax card. It might have been on that tax card. I'm just looking. All right. Okay. Okay, honey. I think that is that's it because we're good on the. I'm got you a good policy like for your vehicle, motorcycle, and travel trailer. Uh huh. That is looking good. But these other properties. Oh yeah, we just have to look at these other properties. I'm going to take all this information back to them, but it looks like we usually quote. A little bit higher limits than what you've got on most of these. So it would definitely be better coverage. Now that's a good the one million
