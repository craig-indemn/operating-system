Hello, this Jeff. Can I help you? Hi Jeff, my name is Kaylin. I'm calling with Davies. I'm calling regarding an audit. For the liability policy with USLI for Kate's Co LLC, DBA Kate's Cocktail Lounge. Okay. Yep. You just need some contact info. We've reached out to the insurer a few times and have yet to receive any information or response back. They are now at risk of noncompliance. Yeah, we have. We have informed them of this. At the same time, is there any any additional information you can give me as far as a contact info, how to reach you. Um, I can email you a copy of the audit form and it has all of our contact information. That'd be good if you wouldn't mind. That'd be great, and we'll forward it on to them and encourage them to. Reach out to you. Okay, I have an email of Jeff at my allianceinsurance dot com. That's it. That comes to me. Cool. Awesome. I will get a copy of this emailed to you. Here in just a moment. Okay. Awesome. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you. Yep. Bye bye.
