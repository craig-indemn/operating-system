Hello, is this Gloria? Hey Gloria, I'm trying to reach Amy. Oh, I thought that is this Richard. Is it Rick? Yep. Oh, okay, Rick, Rick, um, yeah, let me find my insurance policy. Okay, okay, yeah, and I'm sorry, it said you called me a couple weeks ago. I don't know why I didn't get a message. I'm sorry about that. I was sorry looking into this for you, but. They might have put me through to somebody else. Well, could be yeah sometimes I don't I don't work full time anymore so it may have been you know one of those days where where I just wasn't in the office but I saw you message and I get it I mean it's if you're not keeping horses yeah that's that might make a difference on that renewal I don't I don't know but it might but I can certainly get one of my teammates that sort of knows a little bit more about these farm policies to look into that for you. Okay. You know it and I do see what you're saying the policy did just for you last week so I get it that you paid you had to pay it. Yeah, I had to pay it because I wouldn't go let it lapse. Well, no, yeah, you don't want it lapse, but but if there is you know if there is a difference that hey we don't keep horses anymore whether whether Chub was making a separate charge for that or it changes some of the rates I don't I don't immediately know but but we will find out and and get you know get an answer for you there for sure. What it says here is Type One Farm 160 acres left less underoperated the premium is 164 154 dollars. Right. Somebody else from your office is calling me now. I guess it's Gloria. Well, it might be Rachel somebody trying to reach out to you. So so just you know if you want to I can certainly get them to to to look into hey does it make a difference if Andy's not keeping horses and if you're not you're not I just I'm not familiar enough with Chub the rates or how they do every little thing. Looks like it's going to be about 289 dollars. So are you so are you seeing like a separate line item for for equine exposure or horse exposure? I am schedule of liability coverage. Okay, and and you see something specific to to horses there. Well, makes sense to me that that if if you're not keeping any horses that they they ought to adjust that. So yeah, it says animals saddle private. Yeah, okay. Are you keeping any livestock out there? Just a little ten pound dog and I don't count him. I would count that as a as a house companion, not a livestock. Yeah, well, he's a he's a guard dog. Well, that's okay, but he's not but you're not keeping cows or you know goats or you know what I call livestock a dog. I'm not. But well, that's fine. Anything like that? I suspect if somebody else was calling you, they'll leave you a message and you can certainly call them back. I'll but I will put a case in here that we need to ask Chub about taking that off. You know they got that question. Do you want do you want my policy number and all that? No, it's okay. I can see all that in the system here. I can see where we just renewed it. I've got the summary here. You know we've got we've got all that. We just need to ask Chub to take the the horse exposure off because you're not keeping them anymore and that seems pretty straightforward to me. I just need to get it to the right person too. Yeah, yeah, I lost two of them, but they cuffed away and then the other one I gave away. So at some point, yeah. Well, at some point it's it's just what you do. You don't keep them forever and and we don't want you to pay a premium. Some you don't need to be paying a premium for. So let me get somebody to investigate it and I will do that right now. And as soon as we can get an answer from Chub, I will I will definitely be sure somebody here reaches out to you. Okay. That sounds great. Thank you very much. I appreciate your help. You will take care. Too.
