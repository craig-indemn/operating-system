Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Hey Brandy, this is Lyneta. Uh, uh, you just call. Yeah, um, I got your voicemail. I was I've been out, um, I was out yesterday and I left early Tuesday. Um, I got your voicemail that you wanted to give me a call about the home policy. Yeah, uh, you had sent something over. Yeah, because my insurer saying that I don't have any and they would say that they would put the insurance on the house and I will have to reimburse them back if y'all didn't send them something proving that I have insurance. Yeah, so you do have insurance. They're just wanting, um, and I sent over proof of insurance already to them. Okay. They called wanting proof of insurance, but I couldn't give it to them at the time because we didn't have the new policy set up yet. Oh okay. Because the main street policy non renewed, so they called asking for that one and I told them that I hadn't gotten the new policy issued yet, but once we did, I would send over. Proof of insurance, and I did send that over to them. I think it was Monday. Okay, okay, do it. Yeah, so your policy is in force. Um. Okay. And it's and it's good. Um, the thing that I sent you was just a signed application, but I think you did that for me, didn't you? Yeah, I did it. I did it. Okay. Okay, well, thank you so much. I was just worried me a little bit. I'm like, oh lord, let me see. When I got that letter in the mail, I was like, oh lord, let me call her. Yeah, no, I got it taken care of, but if they need me to send it again, I will. But I did. No, I sent it to them. Okay, well that's fine. Uh, yeah, because well all this happened before I I actually signed that paper, so it's probably all good now because I haven't heard anything else from them. Okay. All right, thank you so much. You're welcome, Lyneta. If you need anything else, just let me know. I sure will. Thank you. Have a good day. Thanks you too. Bye. Thank you. Bye bye.
