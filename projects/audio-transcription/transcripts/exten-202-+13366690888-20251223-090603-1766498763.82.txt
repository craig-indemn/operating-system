Thank you for holding. This is Heather. How can I help you? Heather, right pocket. Good morning. Good morning. How are you? I'm doing good. Hope you are. Doing good. I have plans on getting back with you this afternoon if that is okay because I've got to finish up these quotes for you and get them back. Okay. Just in case I didn't give you the information earlier, of the four vehicles, I want full coverage on three of them. The only one that I want minimum coverage on is the 2006 Jeep because it's been wrecked and has a salvage title. So I just want the minimum coverage on that one. That's the one my son drives. Okay. So we'll do liability only on that one. Okay, and then as far as the policy you have now, it is with AO right. I just wanted to make sure I had that correct. AO. Okay. It is with auto owners right now, but they sent a letter saying my son had two wrecks and my wife's son was driving her Lexus and he had a little bump up. So they said they would not cover us going forward due to the damage and the policy expires. I think January 23rd. Right. Okay. All right. You are on my list for today to get that back to you. So I'll email it back. Yesterday was a little crazy and then you know with the holidays. So I will I will send that back today and then we can follow up. I'll be back in the office on Friday. So you can look over it and then we'll follow up on Friday. All right. Sounds good. I hope you have a good day. You too. Thanks, Ray. Bye. Okay.
