It's a great morning, lines and chris. This is Jamie. Hello. Good morning. Yes, my name is Jamie. Yeah, man, your phone system really sucks. It's terrible. But I like the music. Two notes. Okay. My name is Richard G S A R. I want to add onto my policy. A 2024 Mustang. It's just a four cylinders, no high performance or anything like that. But you need you need a vehicle ID. I will. Yes, sir. I'll need the I'll need the VIN number and if there is any kind of bank loan involved with it, then I'll need the. Well, if you have an hour or so, I'll be in this vehicle ID. Are you ready? Not not quite. I'm getting there. My phone system Richard pulled me into an account. For you and Lucille at one two zero nine whispering wind drive and Pontiacs both telling it. I'm not sure I'm looking. You are correct. Okay. All right, and is there a bank loan involved in this or did you pay cash for the vehicle? I pay cash. All right, so I'll add this for you effective today. And then give me one second here. I'm going to take that VIN number from you. All right, I'm ready for it. Go right ahead. Read that VIN number off to me. Well, it looks to me like one. F A six P eight T H six R five one zero zero four zero six. That's it. They did pull a 2024 Ford Mustang. Richard, how is the vehicle going to be used? Is it going to commute back and forth to work or school, or is this just an extra vehicle in the house? Go to the just a local place. I I use sparingly. It's not a oh you know many miles or anything like that on it. Okay. You know. I'll add it with pleasure usage on there, which is the cheapest way to put it on the policy. And then as far as the coverage is, are you looking for full coverage on the vehicle? Not yet. Does I told the woman? Prior to speaking, you. Yeah, I just need I I got to have liability driving. I don't drive it, you know until I had that. So now I got the liability. And when times get better after. We get out of this depression or whatever. I'll put full coverage on it, but just use sparingly around the hood. You know, but I want I want at least to have some. You know, bare minimal. I got to have coverage. You don't want to drive without it. Right? Yeah. Legally, you have to have liability. Anything about that is is it's an optional coverage to purchase. So I'll add it with liability only today. It looks like it's going to increase the policy by 31. Dollars and 93 cents. So I'll go ahead and. I might be I might be able to handle that. That sounds like a pretty good deal there. Guess me. I'm certainly thinking it'd be much worse. Just for you. Let me just know I got good contact information for you, Richard. Because I'm going to push you proof of coverage here. I'm going to email it to you. You will get stuff in the mail as well. But I've got. I've got an address for Lucille. Looks like garden gal one two two two at AOL dot com. Is that still a good working email? Yeah, that's correct, sir. Okay, I'll push proof of coverage to that email address. Is there anything else I can help you with this morning? No, you did do the hell of a job really. Just try my best. Talk to a boss and tell him to get a better phone system. And tell him to play some decent music. Yesterday I called. They had this dumb song. It played. It was like something from a Russian gulag torture. It was for about an hour. To finally I hung up. But besides that, I'm sorry that happened to you. Mondays and Fridays are very busy. Lord at home around the day. But Richard, I hope you enjoy the new vehicle. My name's Jamie. You can ask him in the future if you need anything. But outside of that, I hope you have a good morning. Then we'll talk soon. Okay. Okay. Thank you, my friend. Thank you, sir. Bye bye.
