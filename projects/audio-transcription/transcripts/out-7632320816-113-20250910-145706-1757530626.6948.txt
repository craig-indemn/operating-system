Hello. Is this Kyle? This Kyle. Kyle, this is Gary. I'm calling from Winchester, Salem with Alliance Insurance. Yes. We got a voicemail from a mortgage company, and they gave us a policy number, but that particular policy has been canceled for a year. Yeah, I know they they forgot to renew it. And just let me know last week. Okay. Did you make arrangements for something else or? Yes, yes, I did, but I need to call back at some time because they did make a partial payment everything but 300. For that insurance policy, but the insurance policy got canceled and I need to know if I can get that money back for the canceled policy since it didn't go active for the year. If you can, when did you get your other policy done? Because if the policy canceled with an outstanding balance on it, I would say no. But if you got coverage before that policy canceled, then I would say yes. No, I just got coverage now just because I never knew that the policy got canceled. My bank didn't tell me I didn't receive anything from Alliance except for that they were short 300 and then. And then when I called the bank, they said, "Oh yeah, we'll take care of it." Well, apparently they reached out and then they just forgot to pay off the rest of it. So they pay. I think that's probably it. But the cancellation date is shown October 27th of last year. So even though we paid for for the renewal, like part of the renewal. Well, if it was if it was paid, if the bank had paid the full premium, then any reimbursement would have come back based on that that amount that the bank paid. That's what's confusing me about. You saying that there's an outstanding balance because those homeowners policies they're not penalized. Any payback is made on pro rata, so they don't they don't short rate it or they don't penalize you for canceling early. So if that initial payment was made for that August 28th of 24 renewal and the policy didn't cancel until October, then a reimbursement of the unused portion should have come back. Yeah, I I didn't see anything of that. That's that's the thing. I haven't heard anything about anything. I didn't know I didn't have insurance until like I said a week ago. But you are good to go now as far as your coverage, right? Yeah. Okay. I just got a policy this afternoon. Okay. Very good. I got to go. Thank you. Thank you.
