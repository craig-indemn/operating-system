Thank you for holding this with Heather. Hey Heather, Zach, we spoke last week about how I have the RV insurance with Progressive. And you want me to send over those details. I sent those over to you, I believe on Friday. Did you get that? I did. Um, these I didn't get the. Did you send an attachment? I didn't get an attachment. Or did you just send information? Let me see. Let me call it up because I'm like we could roll it over. Um, hold on one second. So I got the policy number. Progressive policy number is the 2021 cruiser. Um. When is your what is the effective date? Do you know? Do you have a copy of your policy? I don't know the effective date, but it says this it says my renewal period is September 6, 2025 to September 6, 2026. That's what I mean. Yes, beautiful. Let me write that down. September the 20 I mean I'm sorry September 6. Yes, September 6. Okay, and sorry I didn't know if you meant like the original date or the renewal date. No, that's one. Nope. No, you're good. So um. What is the renewal premium? The pay in full premium is 507. Okay, and that's what you usually do. Yeah, I I try to pay. Yeah, I try to pay the whole year on all of my insurances at once just to save a couple bucks. I think Progressive does usually offer a better premium when you pay in full. They're one of the better carriers I get to offer cheaper discounts. Um. So do you know? Do you have a different agent for that policy? Did you? I'm sorry. Do I have? Did you go through a different agency for that? It just says that it was underwritten by Progressive Southeastern Insurance Company. Okay. It don't have like a one like our agency as alliance. Our name would be at the top there. Somewhere is there another agency name? Um, not that I am seeing. It's just the only thing that I'm seeing says Progressive on it. Okay, so you must have went directly through Progressive. All right, that's um. Are you are you able to send me that my chance? I just have a paper copy of it. I can't get into my Progressive right now, but I could take a picture of my paperwork with that name. Yeah. And then I can give you your um if you want to email it or you can text it to me either way. Would be great. Okay, um, let me check here real quick and I could just text it to you. Uh, what's your number? Three three six nine zero nine zero six four five. I'm sorry, I got three three six. Was it nine zero nine after that? Yeah, nine zero nine zero six four five. Alrighty, and I will just take picture of it real quick. That would be awesome. Yeah. And that I will I'll get back and revisit. I think Progressive was the best that we had. And that's what I'm saying. If we could get a copy of that, we could just roll it over that way. We could certainly manage it for you. See, right now we can't even manage it. I can even pull it up. If it's not written through our agency, that makes sense. That makes sense. So but if we have it in our agency, like I said, we can definitely service it and then possibly get like an agency discount. For your other policies, for just having a quote in the same agency. Um, but I'll have to take a look at it for you and see what we can do. But yeah, once I get that, that'll that'll be helpful. Um. And then I can call Progressive and see if we can if we can move it if you want to if that you know that's what we do if you're good with that it would just be signing a form saying that alliance will be assigned to this policy. Pretty much just. Yeah, I mean, even if it even if it ends up being the same price, it just be nice to have everything under one umbrella. That's what we try to do absolutely. Yeah, that's that's what we strive for is to bundle everything. You know, so there's so many people that have like several homes with like state farm and then we've got maybe a couple policies for you to hear. You know it's hard for you as a insured to keep up with who has what. That's that's just so we try to keep it all together if we can. I know we get that. Yeah, with the rate increases, though I know I get it. People are just you know shopping around, they're calling everywhere, so
