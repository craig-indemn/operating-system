Thank you for calling Northwest Farmers Mutual Insurance Company. Please note that your call may be recorded or monitored for quality service. If you know your party's, your call is being transferred. This is Susie. May help you. Hey Susie, it's Addison. I just got your voicemail. Yeah. Um. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Hello. Okay, my headset went off for some reason. So um I started reviewing this. You had not pulled the second named insured Kenos insurance for. Neither one of them will qualify for select. Oh shoot. Um okay. We can change what I can do is unsubmit it. It'll. You can change it over to standard. Um. Now that is going to wipe out your rating tab. So what I usually suggest is get that select quote on. If you've got double screen, get that select quote the rating tab on one side. And take the other side and change it over to standard so you have. Much that may be. Okay. Um. So let's do this. Only I try to look at everything before I call you. The other thing we'll order an inspection. It's a three tab proof, seventeen years old. If there's lifting or anything, there is a high possibility that'll go to an exclusion. But we can order an inspection on that. So you may just want to kind of give them a heads up on that just because of the age and the height. Um. Let me. I know it's hard to remember. I was there. I was an agent for twenty years. We did put a reminder question in. Did you go back and pull that second named insured? Um. Just to help provide it, I know when you get busy, I was there. Um. I'm sorry this happened, but um. Go back into the policy. It should be unsubmitted. Now. And go to the insured screen and you'll see where both of them will show that it does not qualify for select. Okay. Okay, I'm on the insured screen. It says standard eligible. Yes, so yes, so both of them should show standard eligible because she was eligible for standard. But where you didn't pull the second named insured, it recognized it as select. Okay until the score is actually pulled. So that's why the system allowed you to go select. So just for future reference, just always be careful and try to make sure to. To pull that um. We got some feedback from agents because we had a way to go in and just do the average of the two. The agents did not like that because sometimes they were not qualified for that select tier when they averaged. So that's the reason we had to go back where you manually had to pull the second one. Yeah. So. And the only other thing I see you put on here insured would like deal emailed. We do not email, but once it's active. Um. You will be able to go in and pull that billing. Um. Shoot off. We'll also mail it to them. Okay. But then you can you of course you can pull that off and email it. So um on your end. So if you will get that switched back over to standard, shoot me over an email once you've got it done and I will get back on it ASAP so you'll have any declarations or anything that you need. Okay, perfect. I'm finished right now. Thank you so much. Okay, you are very welcome. Thank you. Bye.
