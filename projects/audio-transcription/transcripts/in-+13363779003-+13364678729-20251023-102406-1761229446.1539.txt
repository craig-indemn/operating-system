Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. I hope you. Hey, I was calling because I had a question about my policy. Okay, is it regarding Billy? Well, yeah, yeah, because I was wondering because um, supposedly I think I was on auto draft every month and right now I was looking. Well, I had been looking because I know my payment was these like past few days. And right now, saw that it charged me, but like I think all of it. And I was wondering why. Okay, give me one second and see if I can get that put up for you. Um, is it for the? Which which policy is it for? Um, I think it's for the. Let me check. Does it say? It doesn't say, but it charged me three thousand seven hundred. Three thousand. Okay, let me go ahead and get you transferred with an agent because I don't have access to the carrier you have at the moment. Okay. Thank you for calling Alliance.
