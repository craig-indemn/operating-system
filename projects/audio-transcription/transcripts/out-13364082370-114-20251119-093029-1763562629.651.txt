Hello. Hi, good morning, Philip. This is JC with the Lions Insurance. I was just touching base. I sent you the quote yesterday. I am not sure if you got a chance to review it. I mean, I looked at it. What's the? I guess two things. What's the difference in savings? I guess changing companies. Okay. So let me pull up. Give me one second. Let me pull up. One other thing that I don't know what it's going to cost to put that valve in. If I can even have it done, but that that water event was at two zero six zero three. Point Regata Drive. It's not even the same residence. We we own a condo. Across from where our single family home is. And we had a water event. And decided it wasn't worth pursuing. Okay. In other words, it wasn't even that residence. No. Okay. Okay, and that's. Yeah. Probably. I don't know how that. Yeah, we own two zero six zero three. Point Regata Drive kind of was our lake condo. And we sold our house in Winston and then. The house came up in the neighborhood and we bought it and then sold that. You know shortly after we occupied the residence at two zero eight zero nine. So I don't know how they. I mean, it's the same ownership as far as the you know the people. Yeah. It didn't specify where it happened, and that's why I was asking for more information. And the information you gave me was the information I gave the underwriter. So. I can contact her with this new information just to let her know that this didn't happen at that property. Right. And see what they are. Suggesting we do and if that's the case. Yeah, yeah. I mean, we we. Yeah, I mean we own the condo. Then we didn't own this house, so it happened at our condo, not this residence. Okay. Yeah. So. Anyway. You know it took me a while to figure that out, but I was just talking to my wife. Yeah, I am glad it came to you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So like we discussed yesterday. Yeah, and they should be able to find two zero six two zero six zero three because that's. You know they should be able to find that residence. Okay. But anyway, yeah, I mean, do I need to sign something then or what? So if I want to contact the contact the underwriter just to make sure that they aren't going to require you to install that water water shut off. And if that's. I mean, we have a water shut off. I don't know about it. I don't know automatic. What is I don't know what that cost. You know. Okay. You know I don't know if that's a. You know one hundred dollar job or three thousand dollar job. You know I have no idea. Yeah, I am not one hundred percent sure. To be completely honest with you, I haven't had much experience with that. Some of the. Yeah. Some of the agents here are stating that it would be about five hundred dollars, but I am not one hundred percent sure. Like I said, that's just in conversation that we had here. But I would not be able to say exactly how much it would be. Well, yeah, I understand. Yeah, I mean, so if I am saving five hundred, but spending five, you know, that's what I am trying to. Figure out here and yes, anyway. For the home, we're looking at. Your last year's premium was three thousand six hundred and fifty one, and then we talked about that increase almost two thousand dollars. What their auto owners are stating is that your new premium with them would be five thousand five hundred and fifty four dollars. So then that brings us to the one thousand nine. Yeah, what was it? Yeah, what was it year the what was it the year before. Thirty six fifty one. Yeah, what was what before that? Yeah, the year before that. What was it? Let me see here. If we can see, I am just curious. Yeah, absolutely. So the year before that was two thousand three hundred. Yeah, so it's gone from twenty three hundred to. Fifty four hundred. Fifty five. Yeah. I mean, am I missing? I mean, is there. No, so that they approve. Yeah, oh, they approve some. They approve the state increase. That's that's yeah, that's what happened here. And. Well, reviewing your policy, there was nothing more that affected it, and so that's why we were giving you a call. Because we. No, I appreciate you letting me know because yeah absolutely. Because last year I got nothing, you know what I mean. It's like well that
