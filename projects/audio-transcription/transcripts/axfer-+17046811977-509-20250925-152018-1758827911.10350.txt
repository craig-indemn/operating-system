Hi, insurance. This is Kendall. How may I help you? Hey, Kendall. This is Shay with Gentry and Son Coleman. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. You had I believe it may have been you that somebody had sent us a C O I this morning for a pretty big job we're doing, and then we had sent back over they have like an addendum to their insurance requirements, and so I just wanted to make sure that we had every like coverage that they were requesting, good to go before we submitted that to them. Yeah, I was ready to send on the email back to you. Okay. I was kind of going through everything that they were requiring and then what you have in your policy. It looks like that's the addendum that they use for all trades, not just specific to you guys. So some things are not covered like earth movement is not something that's typically covered. So I was going to send you over a copy of your policy and case they required any of those endorsements that you have. So like you have some collapse and underground coverage as far as like pipes and things like that, but I don't know specifically what they're looking for. There's no limits for that sort of coverage listed. Okay. As far as the coverage per policy, you do need that, like the aggregate for workers' comp and general liabilities. You need everything that they listed for that. I just don't know if they require certain limits for all those other things or if it even applies to you. Because they may not apply, just depends on the type of trade and the job and what you're going to be doing. Right. I can go ahead and send this over to you. If they ask for it, you can send it to them, or if you want to send it with a C O I, you can certainly do that. Okay. You can do that. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. I'm going to hit send now so you should get it in just a moment. Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good day. You too. Thanks. Bye.
