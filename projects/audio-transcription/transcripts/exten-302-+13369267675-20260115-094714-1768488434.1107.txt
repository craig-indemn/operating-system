Thank you for holding. This is Anna. How can I help you? Anna, this is Carol Millow. I should left you a message in their email and phone yesterday about roadside service. So I thought I had roadside service. One of my vehicles broke down and I called and they said I didn't have it. Can you check and see for me, please? Yes, give me one second. Let me get your account pulled up. Okay. Okay, which vehicle is this on? This is on the 2014 van. Um, get the right description. Um. Oh yeah, it's a 2014 Ford, um, Ecovan van. Okay. So I have coverage only for two vehicles: the Kia in that van and it broke down. And I called roadside service and they said I didn't have roadside service towing. And I thought I did because that van broke down last year and I remember filing a claim or something. Something like that. I know I got the money back. Let me. I'll get it pulled up. So give me one second. Let me put you on a brief hold. Okay. Okay, give me one second. All right, thank you. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance Services.

So you do have towing coverage. So I'm not sure what I told you you didn't. I did confirm it is on your policy. You would just have to call Nat Gen for assistance with getting them to set up a towing with a towing provider.
