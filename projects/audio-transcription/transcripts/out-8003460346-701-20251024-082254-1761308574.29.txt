What is the name on the account? Hello, Ann. The name on the account is Cynthia Brayman and William Brayman. Okay, and who my second one? The agent of record, Jeremy Palmer, with Alliance Insurance Services in North Carolina. Okay, and what's that agency code? One five zero three nine four zero zero. Thank you. How can I help you? Um, my insured message me this morning, and we had I had started her account on Monday, processed the payment information in your system. And this morning, the only thing that is showing that's posted to her checking account is. An adjustment we made the day after that we processed the payment for as well. So I need to see what's going on with that. What kept it from going through? If anything, kind of to give them an explanation on these policies they have there. Yeah, that just hit our system today. So it can take a business day or two for it to actually come out of the account itself after it posts to our system. So even though I put it in on Monday, it didn't post to your system until today. Am I understanding that it posted on ten twenty four yet? Okay. All right. Is there anything I did on my end incorrectly, or is that just is that just something to expect? That's just how the system works. Okay, all right. That that'll help me to clarify things with my insured as well. Then, okay, very well. I will reach out to them and let them know that it should be hitting the account. Everything is considered active. I presume correct. There's nothing showing any deficiencies on any of her policies. Okay, very well. Thank you so very much. Yeah, of course. Have a great day. Just Ann, you too. Thanks. Bye bye.
