Roy Lynch. Hey Roy Joe Jessup with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Hey good Joe thanks for calling me back. Yes sir sorry about that how can I help you I got I got an idea but lay it on me. Yeah okay so like everybody else I don't I don't want any damn insurance um and I appreciate that I just gonna you know let it lay it straight out but anyway and I and I I'm not I don't technically need it with with I mean I don't technically need it and I don't have employees and I assume you're familiar with the portable sawmill deal is that correct? Yes sir. Okay good good because I don't want to have to explain it so so um there's this one company that I work for enough to where well I don't know if I'm going to have to pick it up or not but they um they're getting audited you know and I work for them and they're like hey you still got general liability right and I'm like no I dropped it because I quit working for y'all but then they insisted I work for them some more so in short I want to know what it would cost for me to get the least really amount because there's out of you know out of 150 customers I'll have this year they're the one that is gonna I mean maybe another will ask me but they won't require it so see I don't want it I don't need it but I kind of do so that's nice Roy without any details of year make model location volume revenue all the numbers that bake into this equation I can tell you what we do here with these proposals it's a package it's the liability and the property on the mill itself ballpark figure I'm going to tell you 2,500 bucks a year which is you know 200 210 dollars a month on average yeah now when we bake all the numbers in if you want to go forward and take a look at to the penny okay it might go in your favor it may be 1900 Roy or it might be 2800 but 2500 is going to cost you 200 bucks give or take now what that buys you what's the value of your sawmill yeah maybe maybe 25 or 30 maybe so you you might pick up a little bit of a little bit of premium there being it's it's less than a 40 thousand dollar piece of machinery and then the liability the liability piece is going to be a million dollar liability that's a standard limit million dollar per incident two million per aggregate for the policy term total and if an employer or a contractor or whomever that relationship is is asking for it typically not absolute but typically their minimum requirement is going to be a million dollars we don't go lower than that here anyway so we started a million and go up so million dollars of liability 30ish whatever the value of that price point we put on the machine property damage just like just like property damage on a on a vehicle 2500 bucks give or take okay um can you give me an example of when when I would have to call upon that insurance I mean obviously it would be if I was being sued I guess or something but like has have you had any situations where portable sawmill had to say I'm having to file a thing or whatever well you hear about some more stories right you do to my knowledge the customers I've dealt with and we've been fortunate in that Woodmizer space especially to my knowledge I've I've not known of a liability claim right but yeah here here's what I can tell you sorry here's what I here's what I can tell you a lot of times homeowners liability doesn't cover it if you pull it down the road the auto liability may extend to it based on your auto policy but when you're out here operating it that has nothing to do that has nothing to do with it so if and I don't know your relationship or what you're doing with it or this customer but if you're on their property what they want to do is Roy if you come up here and cause any kind of damage you drop equipment it it hurts somebody who knows how somebody gets up there and climbs on it you and I know how Woodmizer builds them it's hard to get to the actual blade not impossible but it's hard yeah hang on just a minute lock out when I go out the back please I left my keys in the truck um that's fine so sorry Roy yeah they're closing up but if somebody gets on that and gets hurt while you're on that guy's property or that owner's property what he's trying to do is Roy you're responsible first I need to see your insurance you're going to list me as the business owner or whatever that relationship is as additional insured so if something happens you mill you mill a 12 foot board who knows what it falls off you hit somebody with it whatever the case may be bodily injury or if you hurt
