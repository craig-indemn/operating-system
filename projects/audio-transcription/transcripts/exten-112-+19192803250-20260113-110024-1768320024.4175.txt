Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Hey Brandy, this is Mindy. McPeak. I just got your message a few minutes ago. Hey, how are you doing? I'm all right. How are you? Good. Let me get you pulled back up here. Give me one second. Okay. All right. All right. So we still have two policies for you, and it's the Haggerty policy and the Progressive policy that has the motor home on it. Yeah. And like I said, my message they're not coming up for renewal, but we just wanted to make sure that all of the information on the policies are correct. Because I think we are going by, we're doing a review call every year, but for yours, I think it goes by the auto policy that we did have. Um and the homeowners policy that we did have since that was in February. Oh yeah. So. Yeah. That's the date that the system goes by. So around this time every year you'll get a call. Okay. Yeah, no worries. Yeah. Um. So. Just want to make sure, mailing address is still six five two three. Um. Her. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Yeah, I think some say Hebron is some say Hebron. So. Okay. Hebron. Okay. Um. So we still have that as a mailing address and your email address. We have. M o o n r i d e r z two seven at gmail dot com. Correct. Yes. All right, and then phone number. Is this the only phone number that we should have for you? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Nine one nine two eight zero three two five zero. Okay. All right. And then, for the. Um. Oh one four wins. Um. That one was with Progressive. Like I said, it does renew. In September, so you'll get renewal documents for both policy Haggerty and. Um. The Progressive policy sometime in August. Okay. And for this one, you do have. Let's see. For of course you have liability, but comprehensive is at a 250 deductible and collision is at 250. For the motor home. Okay. You still have a. Which this is already included in this policy, emergency expense 750. Vacation liability is 10, 000. Um and then you do have replacement costs on personal effects. Up to a thousand dollars and a hundred dollar deductible. Um. And. That's it for that one. Okay. Let's see. And let me pull up the Haggerty. So at the Haggerty, we have the 1971 Chevrolet C10. Both comprehensive and collision are a zero dollar deductible. Of course, you do have liability on that vehicle as well. Okay. And it's a zero dollar. Yeah. Deduct. Oh okay. Yep for com comprehensive and collision zero dollar. Okay. Okay. Would I? I know I think it's like about 69 dollars a month. If we actually raise that deductible on both comp and collision, would that lower the price? Yeah, I can do a couple of quotes and send it over to you and see what that looks like. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, because I think you know. It it's it's pretty much stays garage as a show truck. So you know we very well. Yeah, I mean your. Your average um deductibles will be comprehensive 100 collision 500 is typical. Um the average, but you know I'll do um I'll do that and then I'll also do comprehensive 250 and then collision 500. We just don't want collision to go over 500 because then you know. I mean you pay more out when a claim is filed. Oh yeah. Yeah. Kind of want to keep it kind of low, but you know to at least help with the the monthly payments to get lower. But yeah, so I'll do like two different quotes and I can email it over to you and you just let me know what you think. Yeah, that sounds good. That would be great. Okay, and um, so that's the only two policies I I wanted to go over with you. Um. And you know, see if there's anything else that we can help you out with. I know that the home and auto was moved, but if there's anything else that we can help you with, just let us know. Okay, I certainly will. Yeah, but I can get some new quotes on that on the Haggerty. That'll be great because like I said, it it it only goes to car shows and that's it. I got you. I understand. I mean, my husband's thing. It's his thing. So you know. Um. It's a
