Hello, this Jeff, can I help you? Jeff, Jeff Kennedy, how are you? Hey Khalil, good afternoon. Good, good afternoon. Listen, I emailed you. We need the copy. We need the COI for the way Keith was doing it before. I send you an example of that. That's what we need. The clinician, get with me. Yeah, I got the email and I have forwarded it to processing. It'll probably take a couple days to get those put together. Yes, but. I mean, please make sure. Any technician, the clinicians are listed like each or they list the clinician as listed like Carrie Fox, Bill Fox. Make sure those are listed as well. Okay, yep, and if there's any issue, I'll I'll let you know and we'll get it taken care of for you. Yep, I'll get. And I. And I apologize tomorrow. I have to. I'm flying to Minnesota at 10 a.m. tomorrow. Because I have an emergency appointment, so I'll be back on Thursday. Okay. So I know we talked about meeting tomorrow, so I'm not going to be able to meet tomorrow. I'm flying to Minnesota quickly. It wouldn't be. No, that's fine, and I'll let Joe know that you'll be out of town till at least Thursday. He's been out of town the last two weeks. So he's been trying to catch up on things today. So I'll let him know that you're not going to be available probably until the week after that. Would that be? Yeah, and again, and again, if if it's like please like if you need to contact me even on the plane, I have cell signal on the plane. I can I walk on the plane, so you would meet. Sure. Yeah, if you have the question at that time. So when I back Thursday, when I be back Thursday, we can arrange for the meeting. Okay, that sounds good. Well, I hope you have a safe trip and we meet anything we'll reach out. I appreciate you. Thank you, Khalil. Thank you, thank you, bye bye. Thank you so much. Bye bye.
