Hey Steve, it's Gary at Alliance. How are you? Good Gary, how are you? Hope you had a good Christmas. I did. You as well. Yeah, yeah. What I was call, what I was calling about is you know I talked about my son yesterday and you know a couple days ago and you were giving me a quote you know for insurance. But you made you said something that you know about him living with me and so and he like I said I thought about it more. His permanent address you know has been my you know my address since whatever we moved in in 2006 or something. You know so what I wanted to see is if I were to add you know that car that I told you about that Colorado to my you know to my policy and we got and we got rid of the Volvo you know and I'm going to drop the Volvo. What how much would my insurance you know go up a month? And I was wondering if you get if we could do you know because I think that might be the the best option or the the least expensive option right now. Okay, so we're going to we're going to take the Colorado and replace the Volvo, correct? Right, but we're going to need we're going to need full you know need full coverage on the on the Colorado. Okay. And take the take the liability off the Volvo and just see kind of how what that how that changes my policy. My gut tells me it's going to be cheaper than him getting his own policy. Well, based on the numbers, I I would tend to agree with you, but let me let me just go ahead and run it and I'll call you back and tell you what what the deal is on it. Okay, all right. Well, thank you very much. I'll I'll be back with you here shortly. Okay. All right, I'm good. Thank you. Thank you.
