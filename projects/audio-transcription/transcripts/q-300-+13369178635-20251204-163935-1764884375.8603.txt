Thank you for holding. How can I help you? Hi, yes. Uh, so I just need some help understanding my coverage. Um, back in April, I was involved in a car accident while driving my husband's vehicle. And at the time, I thought I wasn't insured under Progressive, my parents' policy. So a state farm added me to my husband's policy, and his premium increased. Um, but my parents have been paying for Progressive for me this whole time. So I want to confirm whether I did have active active coverage with Progressive in April. Um, and what we can do about it. What's your parents' name? Uh, my mom is Alicia Margarita Winfrey, and that is Randy Jean Winfrey. Okay, let me just take a look here. Now, even if you are listed on your parents' policy, the fact that you are driving your husband's car, it would not fall on his policy. Okay, because um, I mean, even if they added me as as an insured, like insured, like an insured person, would that make a difference? Um, we could. If you could give us a copy of that, we could take you off your parents' policy. Correct, but uh, I mean, we've been paying for coverage with State Farm and Progressive. This whole month. Yeah, if you can get me a copy of that state farm policy and when they added you to his policy, then I can get you taken off of your parents' policy effective that same day. Okay, and will they give like a partial refund or something? Yeah, they they would give back a credit if. Let's say you're you being on the policy is impacting their rate, then there could be a refund. However, if there's nothing. If you're not having an impact on that rate, there wouldn't be a refund. It would just be removing you. Okay, um, also um, is there any way you could send me proof that I was covered during that? Like time of the accident, so I can let State Farm know that I wasn't like an uninsured driver and maybe. Because my husband, even like you said, even I understand like um that accident, but maybe um what I noted what I I have understood that they had me as a. Insured, so that's why they also had more points added. So if I can prove to them that I was insured, maybe that'll make difference, and or something with them. Like maybe now that they I have proof that I was insured during the accident. If I'm framing myself correctly. You are. Um, how many points did they add? Just three. Uh, I believe it's two or three. Yeah. Okay, it wouldn't reduce that because the way the insurance points work is it's based off of how much damage had to be paid out. Okay. So that's where they set the points from. If the damage amount for both vehicles exceed a certain amount, then it that's how they set the points. And three is the most points you can get for an accident. Okay. Um. Okay. Okay, that's fine. Okay. Um. How how where can I send you that proof of the state farm? You can send it to my email. If you have a pen, I can send give you that. Okay. Yes, I'm ready. It's Tracy T R A C Y. At my allianceinsurance.com. Allianceinsurance.com Tracy at my alliance.com. My allianceinsurance.com. Yeah. Okay, and I'll have that uh send that over to you. Do you need me to like add? Uh, my parents' name or their insurance policy. Um, I would just add your parents' name to it. Like write your parents' name on it or something, so that we can put the two together. Okay, perfect. I'll send that over to you then. Okay, that sounds great, and then once I get that, we can take you off of your parents' policy. Okay, okay, thank you. You're welcome. Thanks so much. Have a good one. You too. Thanks, bye bye. Bye bye.
