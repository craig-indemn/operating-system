Sorry for your hold. This is Cody. May help you. Hey Cody, it's Dallas. How are you, man? Hey Dallas, I'm good. How are you, both? Pretty good, pretty good. Hey, I won't take up too much of your time. Basically, I just wanted to know how much I was paying in insurance for our policies one by one. Okay. Is this for tax purposes or what's this for? Yeah, tax purposes. Okay. Yeah, so the reason why I'm asking just for so is because basically on QuickBooks it's showing. I'm gonna be honest. I've been paying for stuff and I didn't know what's going on. And there's a basically something that's charging every month, 400 something. And I just wanted to make sure it wasn't through you guys. Um. And if it is, I mean that's totally fine. Give me just a second here. I'll get these. So you want to know how much it is total for the year or how much they're taking out. No, monthly monthly. Yeah, because I pay monthly with you guys. Right. Um. Give me just a second here. How's things going? You doing well. Yeah, one thing I was gonna say, Cody, is I was I may have to remove one of the or two policies. Just because we're not installing anymore. You're not installing anymore. No. Okay. What do you what do you mean by that? I guess. Yeah, so we we have our we have an office now, and we just send out crews to go install. So you're just doing the manufacturing basically is what you're saying. Yeah. Okay. You're not doing any installs at all anymore. Well, at least our crew isn't anymore. Our crew just works here at the workshop. So have you converted to a more manufacturing only situation now? It sounds like. Yes. Okay. So do we need to kind of look to convert all of your policies over to that exposure instead of the installation? It sounds like. As of right now, we're gonna hold off on that. Because right now we have everyone at 1099 at the moment. So even though they're 1099, they're still your employees and you're still liable for anything that happens to them. So you need to keep that in mind. No, yeah, no for sure. So even though they're you know 1099s, whether or not that's office employees or shop employees or whatever, like a lot of the manufacturers they have a lot of 1099 employees. You know you still need to make sure they're covered workers' comp wise. General liability wise, all that sort of stuff. Right. No, yeah, for sure. So that that'll be well that that's gonna be that'll be a conversation, you maybe a few weeks or so. But I just wanted to know right now basically what the payments were. Right. Um. Let's see. So the the auto owners policy that's your business auto coverage. That one is drafting 409. 98, it looks like. Okay. And then I have to get your other policies pulled up here. And their system has been slow today. Give me just a second here. Taking its sweet time all day. What made you stop installing? Ah, I don't know. I just wanted to do my own thing now. Basically, where I was working at previously. Who were you installing for? Because I know you were doing your own building. FPS. I was still building. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and I mean, I don't know. I'm not. I don't like getting boss around or something or stuff like that. That's just the way it's always been for me, and they and they just got a little more carried away than usual. So. I just so I know that I know how the job works. Only thing is that I just need to learn the office side because I've never worked in an office before. So. But I mean everything's been going well so far. As far as yeah, as far as everything else, I'm like getting. Basically, like the general liability stuff like that. I'm definitely looking into it. Like you said, we need to get covered. It's just a matter of just getting everything sorted because this year will be the first year of doing business taxes. Under my name. So for the 2025 or for the upcoming 2026. Yeah, for for for this year's 2025. I see. And basically, I'm just trying to get everything sorted. Gotcha. Um. See. All right. So premium wise, your two policies are on one billing account, I believe. Yeah, so you have your workers' comp and your general liability with West Okay. What exactly do you use? Okay. So about how much do you think for your shop guys. The shop guys is. How many guys do you have in there? Five right now. You have five shopping employees already. Yeah. Okay. So how much are they going to make? Okay, one second. A week on average, I guess. Are we talking about in total or? Talking about yeah for all of your shop employees or how much do you think a week or a month or a year I guess however you want to calculate it. It'd be twenty five hundred. Twenty five hundred a week. Yeah. Okay. So then that equates to about one hundred and one hundred and twenty five thousand a year and there's five of them. Just let's see your times twelve. No, it's like ample payroll for five people I guess. Are they working part time or? Say that again. You know twenty five hundred a week times fifty is one hundred and twenty five thousand a year. That's not you know if you divided that by five that's only twenty five thousand each person. Yeah. Is that accurate? Yes. Okay. So one hundred twenty five thousand in shop payroll. So we got one hundred twenty five thousand in shop payroll, two hundred thousand in subcontractor payroll, and two hundred thousand in office payroll. Does that all sound right? Yes. Okay. So that puts you at about five hundred and twenty five thousand in in payroll or and or subcost basically. And then your sales are six hundred thousand so you got to it seems like just based on that information that the profit margin is very low at the moment does that sound about right? Yeah. Okay. I just want to make sure I've obviously got all your stuff correct Dallas that's my my goal obviously I don't want you paying for stuff you're not supposed to but we got to make sure we're putting the correct information on the policies because you know whenever you do audits and stuff like that and it'll all get sorted out then anyways if we do it wrong right. And then I guess your truck and your trailer you'll be using that for hauling material to job sites or picking up material and bringing it back to the shop or delivering material from your shop to others I'm assuming. Yeah so we get the material here dropped off. Correct. Yeah we don't we don't we don't haul we don't haul it with our truck and trailer we get it delivered here. Right. What happens if you have a job where something was missing or something like that I'm assuming you'd have to use your truck and trailer to go take it to the job site or. No the guy or something like that or if you guys ever went out and installed one of your own buildings I'm just trying to figure out the use of the truck and the trailer to figure out how we need to get that rated. Yes no I mean well I mean the truck I mean of course it's driven daily because then the day it is ours. Right. So we so they use it to drive to the job here at the workshop. I mean other than that I mean. I mean if if they if they miss anything at the job site I mean it'd be something like a trim maybe or something but I mean nothing too excessive I mean nothing terrible. I'm just trying to figure out you're going to be using the truck and the trailer in the course of your business with the manufacturing correct. I mean would I say it be used anymore I don't think so because like I said we pay seventy bucks to get it delivered here. The material and everything else. Go ahead I'm sorry. Yeah no so I mean as far as using the trailer anymore I don't think we'll be using it if we were to use it ever. It'd be here locally other than that I don't think we'd be using anymore to go far. I mean you still want to insure the truck and the trailer though correct for anything that you do potentially use it for in general. If it if it's going to make it cheaper to just use a truck then then we can just take out the trailer out. Yeah if you want to take the trailer off the policy and just insure the truck only I mean you're welcome to do that I just didn't know you know if you wanted to just get rid of your coverage on the the trailer completely or not I mean if it's just going to be sitting then that's obviously perfectly fine but. Yeah no manufacturer of metal buildings that didn't use trucks and trailers for random things whatever that may be. Yeah no it's going to be sitting honestly. Okay. Yeah we're just been yeah we we're just going to be using the truck. We'll definitely. Just delete the trailer completely then. Yeah delete it. Okay. And then obviously if you ever start using it or whatever and you're putting it on the road and you want to put covers back on it you can always just add it back on. Yeah we
