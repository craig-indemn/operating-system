Would they have the pressure up particular today? Hi, this is Cody Jackson from Alliance Insurance Services. How are you? Here it is. How can I help you? I recently had to have a internal rewrite done because somebody was changing their name from their personal name to an LLC. And whenever they set up this new billing account, it's I guess showing the DBA from the old company instead of the actual insured information. Because it's showing Hernandez installations on this billing account, but the actual policy is under Julio Installer LLC. Okay, let me just pull it up on my end. Okay. What is the last six digits of the policy number? Of the policy number, zero two nine. Account number will be if you have. Zero two nine six seven is the last four of the policy number. Got it. So like if you are on the client summary, obviously it shows. Julio Installer LLC. Well, now and but see now it's showing like Hernandez installations just because I went into that billing account. So. Which is the old? It's like they're linked somehow between the old policy and the rewritten policy, and they don't need to be because the old policies are canceled. They were flat canceled with the rewrite. I see. Let me just double check things out. Okay. So it's listed as the Hernandez installation as you mentioned. Let me just pull it up. And just to make sure, what is your agency name again? Alliance Insurance Services. Got it. Got it. Thank you. Okay, how is it? What do we pull up the account here? So. Let me just double check. So it's showing as the DBA on the billing side Hernandez installation, but on insured name Julio Installer LLC. Right. So like when I search Julio Installer LLC, it pulls up. All the correct information and policies and billing account and everything, but as soon as I go into the billing account itself. It shows Hernandez installations, and then if I click back on client summary. It no longer goes to the Julio Installer LLC name. It goes back to the old canceled Hernandez installations client summary. So like it's linked, the old policy and information is linked. To this new billing account somehow. I see. Yeah, yeah, because usually that's how, especially if it was it was rewritten, it will have its own billing account number. And everything, it will have its own policy number, but on our side, it will have still. Or the canceled policies or the written policies before that. So are are we aiming to like? I want to unlink the Hernandez the old policies from this new account and billing account completely. I don't want to have to ever see the old stuff because it doesn't show me anything anyway. And it's just there is no reason for them to be linked. I can't see the policies. I can't show me the inactive policies when I go back to it. Like it normally does, it doesn't show me the billing account. There is no relation to the old policies from the new billing account and new policy number. I don't want any of that to pull up when I am searching for his information because it's just. Unnecessary and it's not showing me the information I need to see. Okay, I see. Let me just check things out. So when it was rewritten, let me just check who rewritten this one. Do you mind if I put the call in hold for a few minutes? That's fine. Let me see what I can do for this. Hold on.
