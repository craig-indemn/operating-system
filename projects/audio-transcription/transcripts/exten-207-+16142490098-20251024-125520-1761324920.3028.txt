Hey Hunter, how are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing pretty good. Hey, um, I was just reaching out. I wanted to let you know that I've I'm still waiting on IT, but I've looped my manager and your territory manager in on the whole situation. Okay. Um. And that I just wanted to make sure I touch base with you to let you know that we're not we haven't forgotten or anything of course, and that the renewal is guaranteed. I mean, we're issuing the renewal regardless at this point. Um. So I just don't want you to worry or be insured to worry. Okay. Um. What is the situation exactly? So I don't know the full details because it's something in the system, but basically you know the policy non renew or I'm sorry the policy canceled for non payment. And then when it reinstated, the producer code needed updated, and something in the system when all of that happened, the renewal will not flow. It's it's aired out. I can't edit it. I can't push the renewal through. I can't get it to do anything. So they've if they've forwarded it up to something called our. It's like our our internal process team, and they they handle all of the like programming and coding and the stuff that's way over my head. Um. Yeah, so I'm I've I follow up with them every day, but I am just waiting on them. Okay. Well, I appreciate you reaching out and let me know. Um. I guess you'll just shoot me an email or something once everything gets resolved. I want to mess up the billing just kind of on hold until this can actually get sorted out. Whatever. Right. Yeah, the there's no billing for the for billing there's no bills for billing department to produce. Yeah. Okay. Um. Yeah, I guess just shoot me an email whenever it gets resolved and I can figure out what needs to be done payment wise and EFT wise and stuff like that. Yep, we'll do. I'll let you know as soon as I hear. All right, Hunter. I appreciate you. Absolutely, have a great day. Thank you too. Bye. Bye.
