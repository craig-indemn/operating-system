Please stay on the line after you complete your call to provide valuable feedback about your experience with us today by taking a brief two minute survey. Thank you for calling Travelers. My name is Crystal. With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking today? Hi Crystal, this is Taylor. How could I help you today, Taylor? Um. So I I was just speaking with someone. Um. We are under contract trying to purchase another home in Minnesota. Our current Travelers policy. We have a house and auto in North Carolina. We are keeping that residence. Um. But we're looking to see if we could add the Minnesota house. Under the same policy, so that we got the like policy bundle. Um. I spoke with our insurance agent at Alliance and they said they cannot support and that I should contact Travelers directly. Um and then I was talking to someone over here and they sent me back to Alliance. Um. But Alliance has already said that they can't support and that we need to talk to Travelers directly. So they said they don't write in Minnesota. Correct. Is that okay? Um and so. The way it'll work is it can't be on the same policy. It would have its own separate policy in Minnesota, but it would still. You could still get the multi-policy discount because it's with Travelers. So just because it's not on the same policy, that's okay. It'll just have its own policy in Minnesota and. We just have to make sure that we you know. Code it for the multi-policy discount. Let me. Do you prefer to? Do you prefer to have an agent in in your area in Minnesota? Normally, whenever someone uses an agent regularly, we'll find a new agent for them. So that they can. Do business that way. The other way to do business. If your current agent doesn't write in Minnesota, the other way would be to do directly through us. Yeah. Kind of your choice there. Okay. Uh, do you have a question? And I can find a few of them in whatever zip code that you. Are looking to that your home is going to be in. Okay. Um. Yeah, I guess we don't have a preference. Um. If we have the ability to just. Go through you directly. I'm fine just continuing this or like we can at least get a quote this way and then we can connect with an agent. Um. That would be great. Well, an agent would need to be the one to give you a quote if you're going to because they wouldn't be able to pull in any information that we pulled for you or that we created for you. So. Okay. I can I can go ahead and get you connected with an agent. What's the zip code? In Minnesota. Five five. Yeah, five five four one six. Okay. Oh, there we go. It took a moment to think about it. I'm going to try and find one the ones that are closest to that zip code. So five five four one six. This says um. It's a different zip code, but it says it's 0.67 miles away from the the zip code you gave me. It's um. I think it's pronounced D State Agency D Y S T E. D Y S T E yes, agency. Okay D Y N E.
