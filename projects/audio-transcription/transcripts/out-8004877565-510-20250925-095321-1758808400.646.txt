Johnson and Johnson, I'm the underwriter. Call. I need to talk to somebody in personal lines. An underwriter. An underwriter, so you're working on a quote. Yes. So that I get you the right team, is it home, about, business? Um, probably some sort of home dwelling policy. So, so let me let me narrow it down if you'll help me. And then okay, so one in the home category, we have high value, which is a million plus on coverage. I call it the traditional. The next one, which is just traditional home, the other category is manufactured home, modular home, tiny home. Um. None of the above. Here's what I'm looking at. Oh, I can't wait to hear. Go ahead. The insured is his house that he was living in sold, closing is tomorrow. He's building a house. So right now he's living in a really really nice travel trailer on the land where his house is being built. But he put up a large outbuilding, and all of his household goods are in there. Okay. I need to try to figure out how to cover that. Yeah. It's just the contents coverage that you need. Contents and the building probably. And a builder's risk don't usually cover other structures. Got it. Got it. So if if you don't mind, we'll start either with commercial or personal. I think it's going to be in the personal market. Okay. Um and and see how that goes. They might have to transfer you to commercial because they know better than I do, but. Um, that's a good one. I appreciate you bringing it to us. You know what? I'm going to travel you on to the habitation queue. For the next available on that. Okay, sounds great. Thank you so much. I do hope we can help. Thanks. Welcome to Johnson and Johnson. We are an. This is Sonia. May help you. Hi, this is Tracy calling from Alliance Insurance. How are you doing? Good. How are you? I'm good. Thanks for asking. Hey, I'm working on a quote, and I'm not sure if you can help me with this, but you guys usually do with the strange things. So I'm reaching out. Okay. Okay, here's what he's what's going on with this person. Um, the house he was currently living in sold, so the closing is tomorrow. He's building a new house which he's already got a builder's risk for. And he's living on that property, where the house is being built in a travel trailer that is covered under a travel trailer policy. But he built, excuse me, an outbuilding, and he has put all of his household goods in that outbuilding. So I need to try to figure out how to cover the building and the contents. So this is be this is and would be considered an other structure. Yeah, on an actual homeowner's policy, correct. It'd be other structure. Well, can the other structure be added to the builder's risk? Well, homeowner on the homeowner because normally a homeowner builder's risk policy you can have. Dwelling and other structures coverage. The outbuilding is finished though, so would that matter? I don't, I'm not, I don't, I don't think so, but I'm not in claims. I don't know how that would come into play. I mean, I mean because there's a there would be a limit for it as long as it doesn't go over the dwelling value. So because if if it's another structure, I don't have a way of of doing a single shot. Other structure policy, you see what I'm saying. Yeah, I mean if it was if it was a building a garage or something on a piece of property by itself with no main home, then I could do it. But if it's a, if it's really another structure, I don't have a way of doing it. Okay, what about any way to cover the contents if I could? Figure that part of it out. I I don't I know, ma'am. I mean because I mean we have a contents only H O four, but that's for a you know when they're renting a place. But I don't but not for contents in a in their storage. It would. And I know you can add it on the H O three. I don't know how to tell you how to do that. I'm sorry. That's a weird one. That is a strange one. Right, it's terrible. Yeah, I'm sorry. Okay, that's no problem at all. That is what I need to know though. Thank you so much for your help. I appreciate it. Oh sure, thank you. Have a great day. Thank you, you too. All right. Bye. Bye.
