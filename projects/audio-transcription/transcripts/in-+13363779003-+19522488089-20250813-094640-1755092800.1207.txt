Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hey, good morning. My name's Gavin. I'm calling on behalf of the North Carolina Home Builders Association. Was just checking in to see if Joe was in today. Joe. Yes, Joe Jessup. Yeah. Um. So he normally works. Um. Let's see, either from home or in one of the offices. Um. I can send you over to his extension, but I'm not sure if he's available right this second. Oh, for sure. If he's not, I'd be fine with leaving a message for him. Perfect. Give me one second. Alright. Thanks so much. You're welcome.
