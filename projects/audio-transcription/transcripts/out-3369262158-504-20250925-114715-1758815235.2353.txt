Hi. Hey, Beverly. Hey. Hey, it's Holly Alliance. How are you? Good. I've got the activation code. If you want to. Okay, let me find a piece of paper. And you did you just need the one for you because it would be a separate one for each driver. Oh, they each get one. I guess it's mine because I don't know much about theirs. Okay. Okay. And if it's asking for your policy number, I'll give that to you as well. Okay. All right, so the activation code for you is going to be Q. B, A. So Q is in Q, B is in boy, A is an apple, L is in Lima, M is in Mary. Y, Y. Two eyes. Yep, two eyes. And that's mine. Just yours and it's all capitals. I'm not sure if that matters. Okay, well, I guess if you've got all three of them, go ahead and well. Give me the other three others. Well, they might not be activation activation code, but probably don't last but so long, right? Probably yeah. Let me give you the policy number. Maybe that'll help. Okay. Okay. All right, it's two zero three. One two four. Seven eight. Two eight zero zero. Two zero three one two four seven eight two eight zero zero. That's right, and if the other ones um, they should have got a text. But if they need the code, if for whatever reason, just call us back and we can get it from National General. Okay. All right, thank you so much. Oh, I was going to tell you a couple more things. The application apparently went to your daughter's email, so I'm going to send that over. To your email for you to sign the new application. Okay. And also, I noticed that the multi-policy discount for having your home with us was. Well, so I went and added that, and that took off one hundred and thirty dollars for the year. So. That's ten dollars a month. At all, it's going to go down. Okay. Sounds good. So I will get the application sent over. If you have more trouble, just let us know. Okay. And so is our homeowners still with auto owners? Yes, it is. Okay. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good day. You too, Pay. Bye bye.
