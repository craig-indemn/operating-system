Thank you for holding. This is Holly. How can I help you? Hey Holly, this is Brando. I got your ah voicemail. Yeah, how are you? Good, good. Good. So um, it looks like we've got a homeowner that's canceled. We need to look at getting it reinstated. Yes. Okay, I have emailed um underwriting to see if um your policy is eligible to reinstate with a payment. If not, we can look at rewriting it. But at this time, I'm just waiting on the underwriter to get back to see if we can reinstate it. Okay. Okay. So as soon as I hear back, I will give you a call and let you know what our next steps are. Okay. Alrighty, that should be hopefully today or tomorrow. Okay. All right, thank you. All right, you're welcome. Thank you.
