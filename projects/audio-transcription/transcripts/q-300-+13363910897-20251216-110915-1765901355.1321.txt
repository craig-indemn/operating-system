Thank for holding this, Gary. Yes, I I went I started to renew my insurance yesterday and I noticed that it has um my son listed as a second driver. Uh huh. Um, it does does that cost extra? If there's nothing on the driving record, then it should not be any any effect on your premium. Okay. Does he still live with you? He does at the moment, but he has his own vehicle. So I mean, he only drives mine like if we go somewhere together or something like that. And he's actually getting ready to move. He just accepted a job in Forest City, so he's getting ready to move and he won't even be living with me. And he has his own insurance. Yes. If you can get us a copy of that, we can take him off of yours. Um, well, you have his insurance. Oh, I do. What what are the names on the policies, ma'am? Well, my name is Kathy Collins. And I have. K. And I have the Corolla, and his name is William Shore, and he has the Tacoma. Okay. Give me just a minute to pull it that here, okay. Okay. Okay, the address we have on his information is 1950 Tucker Road in Clemens. Is that correct? Well, it was, but he's living with me at the moment at the Flagstone address. But like I said, he's getting ready to move to Forest City. Okay. We would need when he does make that move. We would need to change the information on his policies or policy. In. Yeah. And let me pull yours up here and look at it. He just accepted the job yesterday and he's um so he's supposed to start January 12th. So he hasn't moved yet. He has to find a place to live. Right. Is it Kathy or Catherine? I don't know how you have it. Probably Catherine. And I've got that Flagstone Court Unit E in Winston. Okay. Yes. Very good. See and we've got yours with National General. I would I would say, Miss Collins, that once he does make that move. Um, you can let us know when that happens. And we can get him removed from your policy. Um. I'm going to go into National General's site and see how they've got him rated on here at all. Well, I need to renew my policy now. I usually pay for the year; it's cheaper that way, right? Yes, ma'am. And I've got you set for renewal on the 15th of January. And they do have William listed as having other insurance, so that would be of no consequence to you on the premium amounts. Okay, that's not costing me yet. Yeah, they're not they're not rating him at all on your policy. They just have him listed as a household member with his own insurance. Okay. And I'm looking at nine nine eighty two seventy eight as your renewal premium on the 15th. Okay. And now has that um everything else the same on your policy so we can go ahead and update while I have you on the phone. Because I've got the Corolla for you and I've got full full coverage on the Corolla with towing and the rental coverage. I spoke with someone a few weeks ago. They called about updating my information. Got you. Very good. Everything. You should be good to go, then. Um, and like I say, your your policy doesn't renew until the 15th of January. So any time that you wanted to pay it between now and then, you would be fine to do so. All right then. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Bye bye. And make sure that you have him call us to update his address when he does move or get situated. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.
