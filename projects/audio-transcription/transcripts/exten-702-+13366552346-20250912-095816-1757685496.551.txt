Good morning Alliance Insurance. This is Rachel Mass. Help you. Yes, Rachel. This is Mike Haley. How you doing? I'm fine. How are you, Mike? All doing pretty good. You remember that old four runner I had that I had to get some work done on it and we took the tags off of it. You don't remember. It's been a long time ago. Had too much too much push water on the bridge. All right. Well, anyhow, now I've got a. I called you. You weren't any officer, but I called and I talked to some girl named Holly. All right. And anyhow, I'm not going to drive the vehicle, but I don't want to sell it either. I want to hold on to it, but it's in my driveway, not being drove driven. And I've got a friend of mine, his name's Will. And he's his BMW has lost an engine, and it's just too much for him to to afford to put another engine in it or to fix it. So anyhow, what I talked to Holly about was if if I let him have or use my four runner to drive. What she explained to me is that I would since it's in my the title's in my name I would have to have it tagged myself. Right. That's right. But the policy would have to have Will's name on it. Yeah, he have to be shown on the policy as a driver. Okay. So we can let me let me go a little further. If he if he was to have a bad wreck, then they and they sue they go sue the driver and the owner of the vehicle. Okay. That's something you may want to think about. All right. Well, I mean, if my son Sam has a wreck, they're going to do the same thing. Yeah, but he lives in your household. Right. Right. Right. And Will is just a friend. Right. Yes, ma'am. Yeah. I mean, you're taking. I'm just advising you. You're taking a chance. I mean, you know, it's it's nice of you to do that, but it's putting your insurance company on the risk. At risk. Okay. Well, what if we did it through his insurance company? Well, it has to be titled in his name. He can't put insurance. He can't insure something that's not his. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. What if it was in both of our names? Then you still both. I mean, could he go through his insurance company? That I don't know if they would do that or not. That would be that would be an iffy. Okay. Well, the only the reason I'm asking, I mean, if something were to happen to Will, if Will would have passed away or something, or he got to the point he couldn't drive anymore. You know, I would just want to be able to put the claim on Marty to get the vehicle back. Right, that might be something that you would have to. I probably want to talk to. Let him talk to his insurance company, where he's got his insurance, and then I'd have him to. Do something legally and have it notarized that if anything happens to him, that that vehicle comes back to you. Okay. I mean, you know, but I wouldn't dare want to, you know, put put him on your policy because you're jeopardized. And actually, if he's going to be driving it on regular basis for you know most. Okay, then it needs to be in his name. And I would put and you could be put on there maybe as. Additional insured or that's something that you probably need to talk to an attorney on. Yeah. You know. The question. Yeah, originally you know I was you know Samuel he's on the four runner the other four runner and I was going I was going to give him that four runner because that was the one I've been driving. Right. So I got this Samuel. Samuel 17 in October. Y'all just put him on policy last year. Right, he's an inexperienced operator. And let's let's leave him alone. Leave it on your policy because. When you write a policy in his, if you put it in his name, then he's going to lose his multi car discount. And on your policy and everything, so. Gotcha. Best to leave him until he gets through those and usually. Well, the law thing. Well, it has. You got to go to 24 something now. Well, if it but he got his license before July of 25. He comes off after three years, but now. You know after July the first, it's for longer term. They have to you know they're charged for. Till they're 24, you can own a vehicle
