Only other question I have for you. Okay. Our friend Frank Lemon. Yeah. Is wanting to pay his insurance in full and earn that A O's P I F discount. Yeah. Yeah. However, however, it doesn't reflect on A O's website that discount paid the bill. The billing doesn't show that. We just had to go and manually calculate it from the renewal docs. Yeah. Which is fine, but how I guess my question all that Jeff. I'm sorry. How if he go in and paid that paid in full amount? Uh, let's look at it when you get here. I can I can get to it. Let me let me. I've got a bunch of screens open right now. Are you coming like to here? Yeah, yeah, I'll be there in about twenty. Okay. Yeah, when you get here, we'll pull it up and look at it. All right, thank you. All right, man. I'll see you shortly. Bye.
