Hi, you've reached Bill and Cindy's phone. Please leave a number after the tone, and we'd happy to get back to you. Thanks, bye. Hey Cindy and Bill, this is Jeremy from Alliance Insurance. I hope you guys are doing well. I'm going to try to give Cindy a call on her cell phone. Also, I've got some figures to run by you guys. Talk to you soon. Hey Bill, what's going on? Good, how are you doing? I'm good, man. Did she let you answer the phone? What's that? She let you answer the phone. I thought she did paperwork and did the phone duties. I didn't think you were allowed to answer. Well, she's right here. She is. All right, thank you. Hello. Hey there, Cindy is Jeremy. Hey Jeremy, how are you? I am wonderful. I hope you are. I'm doing okay. I had a little abscess tooth this weekend, so I'm still recovering from that. Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, for you did so you getting some antibiotics and different things. I got antibiotics. I'm going to have to have the tooth removed next week. Oh man. I know. Lee, I don't know what it is about going to the dentist either. Why it is so? It seems like it's never not painful to go there. You know, at least when you go to the doctor, you know they count the pain on your knee. They check it, you know. But it's like it always hurts when you go either your wallet or your mouth. Yeah, you get your wallet. That's right. That's exactly right. So I wanted to run bounce one off of you that I've got where I combined everything with one company. The home and the rental and the auto. Yeah. And then see kind of like where we were at, how we were looking if we were looking. Competitive in that area at all. Okay. Let me go in the house and sit at the table where I got my equipment stuff. Oh, I was just outside reading. Oh, it's pretty day to be out there reading. Oh my gosh, sure is. Okay, so what have you got? All right, so looking first, just coming. I'm just going to roll straight through how this package looks. We're starting with your home. Okay. This is a guaranteed replacement cost policy. So we got the home basically insured for three hundred sixty five thousand dollars. However, if it takes more than that, it's going to be it's going to be rebuilt. If you have a total loss, so even if it exceeds that dollar amount, you're still where you need to be. On okay, all right. Um, gave credit for the monitoring alarm system. Um, put the deductible at twenty five hundred dollars for basically everything across the board. If you make payments on it, then the total would be one thousand seventy seven dollars. Okay. If you pay it up front, it's eight hundred ninety four dollars. Oh, quite a difference. Yes, but I told y'all to give you both because remember you guys didn't want to know what monthly looked like as well. Okay, and now is this this is not an introductory price, is it? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is not an introductory price. This is today's rate. This is what if someone had this house and was with them. This is the rate they would be paying as well. Now I thought we had it was reappraised the house for three hundred seventy two thousand dollars. The tax value went up. Remember we talked about that. Yeah, I do. I do, but remember we're not looking at tax value. We're looking at cost to rebuild. Okay, replace it. Okay. That they'll pay anything to rebuild it. Right. Part of what your tax value is also on that dirt out there in the yard. Uh huh. We're looking at just the structure. The value of land is included in that tax value, so that that's something you have to kind of keep in mind as well. Gotcha. But again, with this policy, this is a guaranteed replacement cost. I know with Farm Bureau they have a special additional coverage of coverage A of twenty five percent, which means that basically. If they got to, let's say there was insured at three hundred thousand dollars, and they got the three hundred thousand it wasn't done building. The extra twenty five percent of that would become available, which would be seventy five thousand. Well, let's say they got the three hundred seventy five thousand it still wasn't back to normal. That comes out of your pocket at that point. This policy you don't have that to worry about. A guaranteed replacement cost policy. This is what they don't carry. They don't offer this policy at It's a new water, water heater. You know, is it worth it if you are going to have to come off from five hundred dollars out of pocket and the insurance company is going to pay seventy or eighty bucks, you know, or a couple hundred bucks. You know, you you always can kind of measure that. The HVAC one, in my opinion. Okay, so the five hundred. How about something like? Well, let's see, a well pump. No, I don't think. I think that cost about eighteen hundred the last time we had that done. No. No, okay, all right. So deductible five hundred on equipment breakdown. Let's go on. Thank you. Oh, you are welcome. Service line coverage from the street to your home. Duke Energy or whatever electric company. If they have to work on your line between the two, they'll charge you for it. If something happens to it, if it's on the box, the box is covered. But anything comes off that box going to the telephone pole, it's only going to cost you. Duke will say that they'll charge you X amount of dollars. You got the same. You got a ten thousand dollar limit on service line coverage with the five hundred dollar deductible built into that price already gave you. This isn't stuff to add on after the fact. It's already built in. Okay. Okay. Um. So moving forward to the rental. All right. We've got it set at two hundred and fifty-four thousand seven hundred dollars. All right. All right. The personal property inside. I need to change this, but I just put in there three thousand dollars. That's enough. I didn't have a note there. We shouldn't. Excuse me. Um. That would be by the people own that are renting the house. We shouldn't. No. There's things that we. Oh right, right, right. Oh god, yeah, I forgot. That's okay. No, that's fine. So if you need it to be more than three thousand, that's okay. If you don't, that's like the minimum. That's fine. The appliances are going to be old anyway by the time. Yeah, that's fine. All right. It's got the same equipment breakdown and service line coverage built into it. The price of paying monthly is seven seventy-four forty-three. Yeah. The uh. Pay in full is six ninety-six ninety-four. And that's for a year or six months. That's for a year. Year okay. Both of those first two are for a year. We just check. I'm pretty sure we knew was, but we just made. Yeah, I just. Okay, no, no. That's okay. I just want to reiterate that to make sure I didn't. And and the value is now is that replacement value on that house. Up to that dollar amount. Yes, man. Okay. And I think that one's a little higher than what your tax value was. If I remember right, I think it was only one hundred ninety-eight thousand. So it's got a buffer in there a little bit. Right. That's good. Yeah, oh man, I'm very happy so far. Okay. So the auto. Um. For the I'm going to give you the numbers for the year and I'm going to tell you what it includes after that just to go straight down. Is that okay? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So this is a twelve month policy also. We don't do six month policies here. It's one year. If you. If you pay it through payment, it would be eighteen thirty-nine point fifty-two. Eighteen thirty-nine fifty-two. Yes. For the both vehicles. That's for that's that's payment plan. That's payment plan, which for six months would be right around if you wanted to divide it back into what you were accustomed to. This is with the twelve, the thirteen, and the twenty-five. Two, the two thousand two avalanche. Oh. The twenty-five Santa Fe and the two thousand thirteen avalanche. That's for the three vehicles and when we sell the one, we'll get rid of that. Okay, so what's the full payment? All right, the full payment would be sixteen eighteen. That's one six one eight point eighty four. Okay. Okay. The liability coverages on all the vehicles is one hundred thousand per person, three hundred thousand per occurrence. So that's you at all hitting someone and then having and sustaining injuries that would cover up to one hundred grand per person. These can be elevated and changed. That's our baseline here at our agency though we don't. And we talked. The um. Wait a second. And what if we pay it all in full? Is there ahead of time? Is there a reduction on that? That's the full. He gave us that. Yeah, it's about two hundred Then part of that will come down. You know it's two sixty for the year, but obviously if you take it off when you've only got one month left, you are going to get two hundred sixty dollars back. That makes sense. Uh huh. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. So my question is, how are we looking compared to what you guys are paying right now? Are we competitive right now? I gotta look at it all because we we made some changes that you are you are giving me numbers on some of the changed items and we get back to you in about ten minutes. Wait, how long? I don't have those changes in the current policies. You know, like a higher amounts of the you know limits and stuff like that. Let's see. What are we paying per year for? What we're paying right now is what we want to know. I gotta look at this different policies, son. It's not like I could. The house is fourteen twenty-seven. Okay. Now the car kept changing over and over again because we added vehicles, got subtracted vehicles. With the avalanche, avalanche, Santa Fe. That for the year that for six months is eleven thirty-six. Okay, so basically I am definitely beating them so far. Big time. So far. And the rental. The rental house. It is eight fifty-eight. Yeah, so I am beating that too. Now I understand you can't tell me what the insurance company is now, but I want to make sure it's it's a top rated insurance company. Yes, they are. They're plus AM Best. Over one hundred years experience. Fortune five hundred company auto owners is the name of the company. Auto owners. Okay. Yes, that's the one that's going to turn into Liberty. No, Safeco is. Okay. Yeah, Safeco's the one going to be turning into Liberty. But auto owners, we've been partnered with them. Our agency has been partnered with them for eighteen years. So we've got a long relationship with this company. I don't recognize name and they affiliated with another one. I mean, I've been out of the business for about three years now, almost four years. So. Auto owners is based out of Michigan, Ohio area. Where their home office is. Okay. And they're in the independent agency market, which is what you. What you contacted here. When you are with all state, state farm, farm bureau. Nationwide, you can only appoint and sell insurance for those companies. Right. These companies that we are associated with, we're not captive agents. So we can write with either auto owners or we can look at Cincinnati or we can look at Safeco. We've got more options and more flexibility. So we can shop it for you. As opposed to you just trying to deal with one company the whole time. Well, that's what I had hoped you would do. So that that that's why we contacted you rather than you know go with another company like Progressive or whoever the heck you know they would only be using their own. Underwriting. Okay. Right and and we also we also sell the Progressive also just so you know. You sell what? We sell Progressive also. Oh, you do sell Progressive. Yep, we do. Yeah, they're one of our carriers also. So I mean, there is a lot of different. We got approximately thirty some carriers. Okay. This one you just gave us. Would have the best rates out of all, correct? Oh yes, sir. Absolutely. Okay. And I trust your opinion on it. I think you are pretty straight shooter, so I am all right with that. And I can see that. The the three cars. Cost us seventeen. Once my car is dropped, it'll cost us two hundred fifty dollars less than than the it'll be fourteen. No, I am sorry. I need to get a calculator because I can't do this in my head. Hold on a second. Sure. I used to be able to do math in my head. No more. That's all right. The loan over. Okay. Tell me when you are ready and I'll give you some numbers. Okay, just let me take the two fifty off this. Okay, that's twelve hundred and forty-eight dollars and eighty-six cents. And that's what our insurance would be once we sell. The two thousand two. My wife just said we're paying on the one car eleven hundred dollars. No, no, we're paying on all three cars. That's the total. All three cars do. Yeah, and if you double it, that's what you pay for a year is twenty two hundred. Right. So I mean. We're definitely dropping farm bureau. Okay. We're definitely going to take you up on this. Now let me ask another question. You give me all these great quotes. But we're going to have to convert
