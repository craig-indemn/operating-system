My name is Joy. May I have your name? Yes, my name is Brandy with Alliance Insurance. Hi Brandy, how are you? Good, how are you? I'm doing good. Thanks for asking. You're calling from what agency? Alliance Insurance. For Nancy, right? How can help you with this policy, man? Ah yes, we just have some questions with the billing because the insured got a bill for, um, seventy two dollars and we're wanting to know what that is from and was it for. Yes, yes, okay. I'll go ahead and check what happened. Why they were having a bill? I'll do the rest. Okay. Okay. Cancel. Reviewing it. Maybe I'm still checking. I just really need your time. Okay. Okay. Still checking. Sorry for the delays. Seventy two dollars. Actually, as per checking here, seventy two dollars was actually their remaining balance. As per checking here, as we restarted the policy six twenty p, there there is still a balance on this policy and as per checking here, um, it shows that their equity date or they the the date that they are paid is until to cover the six twenty one twenty twenty five. I can see a payment here that was one hundred twenty five and twenty six, but that is to cover their remaining balance plus the seventy two dollars. Okay, so I didn't understand anything that you just said because one hundred twenty five dollars was the remaining balance from canceling the policy. She didn't make that payment. Y'all took that payment out because y'all didn't take it off of auto pay like I asked you to, so that she could get a full bill in the mail and make a full payment. So tell me exactly what the seventy two dollars is for. I'm okay with her paying the one twenty five. Tell me exactly what is the seventy two dollars payment for as far as what date does that seventy two dollars cover? That is what I need to know because I can't tell the client that the seventy two dollars is just for the remaining balance when she thought that y'all took the remaining balance of one hundred and twenty five dollars. Okay, I'll provide the computation, man. One moment, I'll provide. I'll just compute this and I'll provide the computation. Okay. Uh hi. Yeah. I actually talked to one of our specialist team now, and what I recently found is this policy was actually under the North Carolina, and under the state of North Carolina we computed, uh cancellation rate not just the pro rated it's a short rate basis, and as we check from the from the date of their, um renewal January twentieth up to, uh, the cancellation date six twenty seven there is one hundred fifty eight days. Yeah. So I understand that, but why wouldn't you take it out the first time, and not bill her for the whole thing. Actually, ma'am, we really compute the short rate. Yeah, um, we really compute the short rate once we just canceled it. And as we're checking here, the total amount that they have to pay as we computed the the cancellation, based on the short rate is one thousand seven hundred seventy three dollars and ninety five cents. However, the only payment actually, uh, this some fact that was actually not. Yes. What I'm asking is that the the policy was canceled. You still took out one twenty five twenty six. Why not put the seventy two dollars into that one twenty five twenty six because one twenty five twenty six. It does not equal up to what her normal payment would have been. I understand ma'am, but if you will check the date that we cancel this policy, it's seven o two, and we no longer have enough time to add it because, we request notification to the end to the bank six thirty eight. Uh, last June thirty eight and we cancel the policy seven o two and if you will check the payment was also received seven o two it's the same day so it's not possible that we will be paid. And that also doesn't make sense. What is the one twenty five for then? Because that's not a normal, insurance monthly payment that she was making. It's. Yes, because if you will check the billing ma'am, there is a lot of change happened. So billing is uh yeah, there is a billing adjustment. What we computed.
