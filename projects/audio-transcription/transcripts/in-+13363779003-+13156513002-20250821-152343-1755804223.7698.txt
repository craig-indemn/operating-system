Thank you so much for calling. All hands insurance. Hi, this is Sandy Co. Said calling. Have you got a minute to chat? Well, you are you busy one of the agents. Probably. Well, she's not there. Heather's not in the office. So if you if I can I can talk to a receptionist. She could she helped me last time. If I could get a hold of one. Okay, so do you know who you talked to last time? No, five minutes ago I just called and a girl answered the phone and she put me over to Heather's office but Heather is not in today. Yeah she's not in right now give me one second. All right. Give me one second. I'm just trying to find out. Okay, it was Amanda who called who helped you just a second ago. Let's see what can we do. What are you trying to to accomplish? Okay, well Heather had mentioned to me that she had she might be able to bundle my house and my car insurance because my car is with with Prudential and the house is with Travelers. Okay. The car just got paid. I believe it was put it was paid. Now it's time for the house and I'm wondering if they're going to automatically deduct it. From my checking account because I never heard if it got bundled. Okay. The homeowner is with Travelers and the auto is with Progressive. Progressive. Oh, is it Progressive? Oh, why did I say Progressive? Yeah, Progressive, not Prudential. That's from New York. Yep. You have so many properties I don't understand. No problem. Yeah. Let me see. One second. So we're transferring everything to Progressive or do you know if. No, we're not doing. We haven't found out if it's possible yet because my car insurance went down quite a bit like 300 dollars but now my house insurance is due in a week or two or three and so I'm just trying I just want to find out how these things are getting paid is it coming out of my checking account or is it going on my credit card. And if it got bundled. And it says direct billing. Give me one second. Let me see if I can find out whether it's direct billing or not and what are you using. Take me just a couple of seconds. That's fine. I would just like to know so I could write down both of them. Sure. One second. It takes sometimes a little bit for the website to get me through. That's fine. I'm in no hurry. Personal. We're going to do it with a policy number. Should be a lot faster. Technically. The computer likes to play games with me. So I have to. What was your name? Waiting game. Armando A R M A N D O. Okay. I'm the only guy that answers the phone. So. Okay, well that's fine. At least you get it answered. And at least check and understand you. Let's look at some credit card and it was five four six nine. Okay. Which one? Now which house or car? This is the home. This is for the. It's going to go on the credit card five four six nine. Okay, I'll have to look that up and see which that one that is. Okay, and has it gone on yet? No, actually your your insurance expires on September. Fourth. Okay. No September sixth that's when it expires and renews on that time. Okay, well I don't know what card that is that it's going on. Does it say if it's Master Card or? No, I only see a next. The last four digits and that's the last time we used a credit card to make the payment. All right, let's see. Well, I don't know which one that is. I don't even know if I still got that one. So we'll have to I guess we'll have to do some digging. I know. Okay. Well, did did you get the receipt for the payment last year? It was on September that we sent you the that. No, I just got the bill for this year this this week or last week. But so I don't I haven't even looked. I thought it was coming out of my checking account. So I didn't know that it was coming out of a credit going on a credit card. So I'll have to check and see if I've got. I mean we've got time for this so plenty of time before. Yeah, I'll have to look some do some more investigating. So could you at least tell me how the car got paid. How the car got paid, Missus. Go ahead. Yeah, that was yeah. Progressive. That's another another page that I have to go into. Give me one second. Okay. It always takes. It's time. That
