Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Well, Brandy, this is Scott. Hey Scott, how are you? We've been playing phone tag, ain't we? We have been. Ha ha ha. One second, let me get your account pulled up. Jeff even called me yesterday. Something about I don't know why you'll why it wouldn't ring when you tried to call me, but I don't know. Yeah, I have no idea. I even tried another phone and then it went through and I was able to receive a voicemail. You left me a voicemail. Yeah, I left you too yesterday. Well, I don't even have a voicemail. My voicemail box is full and it won't accept voicemails. So some I don't know if he was dialing the wrong number or what. Yeah, it was dialing this number. Well, I don't know. But I'm not. I don't know. I don't know. It might be Carolina West. Carolina useless. I don't have anything pulled up. So bear with me. I'm fine. I just thought I've got out. I've been I've been in a meeting. Which I never have, but I did today. All right, so your home and your auto is coming up very near in February. Yeah, February. Yeah. Um. See the auto has went down, but the home has increased. I ain't surprised. Don't make me mad. I ain't trying to make you mad. Not what I set out to do. I know. Dead goon it. Let's see. But as far as like, um, I'm just going to ask you a few questions for the home and auto and then we'll get down to numbers and all of that just. Okay. Um. So for the home, um, you haven't had any updates on the home in the past year, right? No. Okay. Um, you're not running a business or renting your home out to anybody. No. Correct. Okay. No. Yeah. And do you have any animals? Animals. Yeah. What more you mean it? I got all kind of animals. Okay. So like. What type of animals do you have? I mean, I've got some cows. I've got some horses. Uh, got some dogs. Got a cat. Are they on the same land as your home? Or are they on a separate piece? Uh, they're on a separate. Well, the horses are probably on the same. As my home. I'm looking to see how we have this set up. I've had this question before. Is something new? Um. No, but no and yes. Um. We should have asked whenever we did the policy at the. Well, you might have. Um and if someone did or or if they didn't, I mean, the the home policy looks like it's been with. Auto owners for several years, so. Yeah. Obviously, they were either okay or. The the land that all the other animals are owner on a separate piece of land than the actual home. It is. Because I don't see where we have like any animals included under your homeowners policy for like liability purposes, so I think they're all separate. So once whenever we do this review again, you just say no, not on. Well, to say actually, if you want to know, I mean, what what is this? I'm careful how I answer this. Uh. I just built a new pasture and with this six months ago, and and got the horses. And they're probably actually on the land where the house is at, or part of it is anyway. Uh. I don't know if that matters or not. Do you have that affiliated with the? Because it looks like you have. So the commercial side, the Pine Hill Farm Supply is that. In with like your animals and stuff. No, no, it should not be because I've got I I did have like a farm and you know for. Uh, with a couple tractors or something in a. Uh. I don't know. I don't how I got it all. You know I got that cabin. It's separate too. Okay, so none of the none of the commercial stuff I know about because I'm not on the commercial side. But I was just wondering if. Is it um? So if your cows and stuff are on a a separate. They are the cows are, but the horses are just here in the last six months. Could. You know potentially, I mean, part of it is on the land that the house is on. But I, it's just in case they were to get out and. Car hit them. Really like. Yes, and if somebody goes near them, possibly hurt. Oh, so you want you want to be covered for liability. Yeah All right, the the horses. That's on separate, but you can, yeah. So I got two tractors, fifteen cows. You sell the calf, and then you have one barn. For the. Yes. Well, there's there's a horse barn and a cow barn. Okay and. How many acres is it for the cows? Oh, how many acres in pasture? Yes. Uh, say fifteen. Okay. Um. The barn is a forty-two by sixty. And the sensing for the cows, what type of sensing is it? It's a high tensile four strand, electrcity. And how often do you check it? For weeks or months. Uh, probably a couple times a month. Okay. All right, that's all the questions that I can actually remember. So if they need anything else, they'll they'll probably reach out to you on that. Okay. All right. We'll just see where we go from there. As of right now, we'll just. If there's a possibility of having to move the home to a farm owner's, we'll figure that out. In a couple days, that after I talked to to them, but as of right now, if we keep it with auto owners, the. Um, is your hold on? Let me go back a page. Is your roof year still 2011? Yes. Okay. And. So it looks like as far as the home goes, the reason why it went up in prices because they gave you more coverage on the home, and plus on top of that there was a state rate increase. The coverage that they gave you. Was forty-two thousand more, so you'll be sitting at four hundred and thirty-six thousand five hundred. For this. That's contents and to replace the house, or is that not going to come? That's just that's just their replacement cost on the home, but if. My word, that's twice what I get for. If that number increases, then your contents and everything else increase as well a certain percentage. So. But this is what it would take to rebuild a home, not not sell it as. So this is what. Auto owners is saying that it is. Now other companies do use different replacement cost estimators to come up with that number. I would figure that it's going to be somewhere around four hundred thousands. Yeah. By by looking at everything already. So to me, the price that you have for the home is two thousand five hundred and fifty nine dollars for this year. Really. Twenty-five hundred. Yeah, and that for four hundred thousand, at the bout in the right ballpark, it would be. The only way that you would get less than two thousand or even close to two thousand even for four hundred thousand in coverage would be if you lose a lot of other coverages. Like not having replacement costs for the roof, that would change to a depreciated value or no coverage at all. Because of the the age. Yeah. With some of our other companies, you wouldn't have coverage for the horses if we've got to if we add them onto this homeowner's policy. Others they're going to exclude it. So it it would just depend now if there's a possibility after talking to. One of the people that specialize in the farm space. If they say, "Hey, let's move the home with everything else," that might be an option, and you might be able to get it a little bit lower. With having the same amount of coverage, I don't know. Right. Coverage for the roof though, but it's a possibility. But that would be the only only advice that I would give is if we're going to move it from auto owners to try to do a whole entire farm policy. Okay. To have everything all on one. Okay. But then that would leave your auto by itself and without and without a homeowner's policy with auto owners that would increase the auto after I already told you that it went down. Yeah, I know. So. And that only went down. Not much. I'm sure I can't believe. Not much at all. It was fifteen forty-five and now it's going to be fourteen ninety-one for the year. So not much at all. So what? Tell me what's on that policy. What vehicles? Can you are you looking at that? Yeah, I can pull it up. Because that just seems incredible high to me, but for what I've got. Now auto owners does run a little bit high on their on their auto policy. Yeah. Can tell you that I used to be with auto owners. But it looks like we have twenty twenty twelve. Uh, twenty twelve Lexus RX and a two thousand three Chevy Express, uh, fifteen hundred. I see it. Uh, I had my mind that was oh four Chevy Express, but that's that's what it is a C zero three zero four but. Neither here nor there. But see, I've got a. You know, this was one thing that my father-in-law done for me that helped a lot when I my two older kids. When they were started driving, I had enough vehicles in my name and a trailer or something I can't remember what it was, but with that company it was like if you've got five and you got a farm plan. At that time, I did with him. No more farming. I don't I don't consider myself a farmer at all. But anyway, I had the insurance for it, and he said so I did not get that what he called it the. Because the inexperienced driver. Oh yeah. I did I was exempt from the inexperienced driver with those two kids and luckily Lord's vision was you know they didn't have any problems when they was inexperienced and we didn't have a issue. But I've got one that's getting ready to be six to well she'll be sixteen next year. And I'm gonna be buying a car for probably next Christmas or something hopefully. But that's something I got to think about down the road and you know if it's a way to get by. Like I did before, it'd be great. Yeah, that's that's not going to be the case. For that one, the inexperienced driving age on with any company right now. They are charging for inexperienced drivers and it's actually for eight years instead of three. Twelve. So. But this thing he that he had me set up on was like if you had five plated. You know vehicles and trailers combined, then it it was I was exempt from that with my other two kids. Yeah, I don't think that's a thing anymore. Okay. Because I know none of our companies offer anything like that. They are going to charge for those inexperienced drivers. Yeah, and it's a lot too, ain't. Yeah, it is. It definitely depends on what type of vehicle you get though. What what what type of vehicle should I get? An old one. Well, it'll be bad. Yeah, I would say you know anything under or around two thousand twelve. Oh, it'll be ten years or older. You know or. Yeah, I mean as long as it's in you know an older vehicle, I wouldn't say get. I nothing like SUV or truck type, you know just a little old car. Oh yeah, it'll be something like Honda Accord probably or something. You know. It's probably what I'll be looking for something similar to that. But I mean, if this is you know later on this year or next year whenever she gets it, that's. I mean. Yeah, she wants she's taking it now. I don't know what auto owners rates for inexperienced drivers is going to look like in a year. Yeah. No, but. Um. And then yours, you know, comes up at February. We end up staying with auto owners, then. You could stay in it, you know, a month or so, and then we can move it by February. Right, right. Okay. But. Um. But so, by my van, what is the if the van is is pleasure years? It's like the lowest that we can put it. Okay. Okay. Um. But. That's where it needs to stay. If we move the home, then I would say we would need to move the auto so that it doesn't increase anymore. And then I would have the option to look into National General. That company would still give you a discount for having a policy with us if if we do a farm policy. So it still give you that discount. Now what the rate will look like? I don't know because we would have to to look at it. But everything is based on the home right now and the animals and the land and what we're going to do with that. Okay. But. Um. For the auto itself, um, I mean you do have a. A higher liability coverage. You're at five hundred thousand five hundred thousand for bodily injury and then one hundred thousand for property damage. And then the uninsured underinsured motors is exactly the same. And then medical payments are five thousand. Sometimes National General will give five hundred five hundred on liability. Sometimes they ask you to drop it down to two fifty five hundred. It depends. Um. Especially with in the future having an inexperienced driver, they may not want you to have five hundred five hundred, possibility. But that's in the future. Well, if so, you're talking about my deductible. No, this is for your liability coverage. Oh oh. The deductibles you can have at whatever you want it to be. You know, maxed out at one thousand. But currently right now your deductibles for the Lexus is one hundred on comprehensive. Five hundred on collision, and then for the van, it's one thousand for both. What about if the Lexus was a thousand
