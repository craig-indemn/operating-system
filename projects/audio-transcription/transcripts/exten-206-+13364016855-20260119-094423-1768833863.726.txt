Hello, this Jeff, can I help you? Hey Jeff, this is Cheryl Dickerson. Well, hello, I'm doing great. Hope you are. Yes, thank you for following up with us, and no, I had not seen that email. Well, let me get back into your file here and dig it back up. Hang on one second. I'm terrible about emails. No, that's fine. That's why I followed up with a call, and it's no problem at all. All right, I'm just going to walk through. There are four or five things that we addressed that I was even going to take action on or find out yes or no. Let me say, I'll tell you, I did did read it. I set was going. We did read it. Okay, great. And we understand everything, and I. I think we have decided to up the umbrella policy to two million. Okay, great. All right. Okay. That is no problem. Yep, go ahead. So our original umbrella policy, I think, is tied into our the Whistle thing, and we we make a quarterly payment. Will this will this be the same way or? Yeah, all we'll do this will be just an endorsement to increase that limit from from one million to two million. Whatever the payment mode that is current will stay the same. It'll just be an increased amount. So I think your annual premium on that was eight sixty four. It will now become fourteen seventy seven. So if you're paying that quarterly, you should have four equal payments. Now the one thing that might be possible if they have already billed and. It's possible that they have that first bill may stay the same and then they might give you three equal remaining payments. We'll we'll see how that works out once we get that endorsement processed. Okay, so the payment, the payment that I just made that you printed out for me. The umbrella policy was not included in that payment. It wasn't. That was just for the package. That's right. Yep, that was just for the package. Okay, so all the other things that I listed in the email, any questions? You understand that clearly. Was that good? The package will. Once they take that location two away and remove the coverage for the cows, that will generate another. Deck page with probably another bill. Let's see, the rest of it was what was included and not included under the umbrella. Did that make sense as well? Yes. Okay. Yes, it did. All right. Okay, so it sounds like the only thing I need to do then is just increase that umbrella from one million to two million. And that, like I said, it'll generate an updated declaration page with updated billing. And if there's anything wonky with that, I'll let you know. Otherwise, whatever generates when I make this change, I'll send it to you as a reply to the email, and that way you'll have all that until you get it in the mail. Okay, does that work? That sounds good. Awesome, I appreciate the call back, Cheryl. Thanks a bunch. Thank you for following up. Yeah, you're welcome. Y'all have good week. Okay, you too. All right, thank you. Bye bye.
