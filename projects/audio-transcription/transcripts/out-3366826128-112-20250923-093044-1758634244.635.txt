Hello. Hey, Beverly. It's Brandy with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I am all right. How are you? Good. Um. So I am working with the underwriter for Georgia's policy, and she had a few questions because it looks like the home is in a trust with Brian Fulp's name and several other names. Um. Do you know anything about the trust? Yeah, Brian Fulp is a son. Okay, that's what I figured. Yeah. And would you be able to get the documents of the trust? You know I can go over here, cross the street. Let me see because he's over there now. Cleaning up for his dad. Um. Let me have. Just I'll go over here right here on the on oops move over. So any questions he can answer? Any questions? Make quick. Give me one minute. I walk across the street. Move. You got to move move. I am talking to my dog when you hear me talking because. As I walk, he walk him too, trying to beat me the way he think I am going to go. That's what kills me. What he do all the time? My son says that's what he calls it, mommy. In case something's go wrong, somebody in front of you he'd get to him before they get to you. Oh geez. Hey, don't come out here. Say. Give me one minute. I just gave me a look at my email too. For my house because I know the bank sent me a letter too. About insurance, the homeowners insurance, and I was like, "Oh dang, not due till October, but I guess they just ahead of stuff. " Yeah, they they probably received the non renewal letter as well. So they're sending you something. Saying that they need either proof of insurance or they're going to provide you insurance which is going to fire. So that's what it said. Exactly what it said. Yep. I think about it. Exactly what it said. Let me see. I know he's doing the floor. Hold on. DK. Come here. Look, I need you right quick. Move you right quick. Okay. I need you right quick, man. Okay, the lady, you know I am doing the insurance on homeowners insurance on the house. So you know with that trust you got your names, pops house in the trust. So what was the question you needed to know? So I'll need the trust documents. You need the trust documents. List out who is the owner of the home. Because it did what. It the trust will list out the the owners of the home and who who. And the underwriter is going to need that just a copy. Okay. Oh, just make a copy of it. Okay, all right. Okay, so we'll get that to you before the week lets out. Is that okay? Yes, that will be great. Okay. Anything else you needed on that part? Um. No, that was the only thing that she was asking about. Um. Everything else looks fine, and then of course. Okay. I think I'll be finished. Okay. I'll listen to you. I am sorry. And then of course with yours, um, did you have any questions with the quote that I had sent over for yours besides the? Because they don't give a discount for our alarm system. Oh okay. Yeah, that was like but two hundred sixteen two hundred more than my norm. Yeah, but this is the lowest thing that I have. Okay. With you, with you having the same coverages that you had before. Okay. Okay. I mean, we could. We could do. This is going to go up in order for it. It will come out. It will a little bit. Yeah. Now if you wanted to make the deductible higher on yours, that would make it come down. My deductible was what a thousand dollars. Yeah, so if we increase it to two thousand five hundred, then the price of the policy would decrease. No, that's okay. You know to me it's easy to come up with a thousand if it is twenty five hundred. Yeah. So I just uh. Waited it doesn't make my mortgage go up too much more. Okay. Yeah, so that's fine then. So I would say. Let's see seven. Nine. So your mortgage should, for the insurance side, should only be around twenty two dollars more than what you normally pay monthly for your mortgage. Okay. Now that's not including like you know the taxes and everything else and that increase, but for insurance, it's only twenty two dollars more monthly. Okay. Okay, that's fine. That's. So whenever you come and drop off the. The papers. Yeah, the trust papers. Then we can go ahead and issue yours and I'll have you sign your um. The application for your policy
