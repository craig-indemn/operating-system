Good afternoon, I like insurance. Yeah, how you going? Okay, good. How are you? Been good. I called probably like a month ago and wanted to talk about my policy and request something. I forgot her name in Spanish Spanish speaking and they never returned my call. Okay, all right. And who am I speaking with? This is Gina Morales. How many there is available for Spanish speaking? How many. What is it for personal ones or commercial ones? Personal. Personal. Okay, so yeah, we have one. So if you want, let me let me put you on a brief hold. I'll see if she's available. If not, then she can always call you back. I forgot her name. What's her name? Is it Daisy? Daisy. Okay, I think because I got my policy like I've been on so long I forgot the her name and this might be something somebody new probably. But anyway, yeah, if she can return the my call, so if if I can talk to her now. Okay, I can definitely try. What's your address? Three Six Eight South Winds Village Drive, in Dracotilla, South Carolina. Twenty Seven Three Zero. Okay, all right, and um, so the policy what's pulling up it it showing um the first name is something else it's. Rogelina. Who? Is it what? What's your first name again? I'm Gina. Gina Morales. I mean, we should review the policy at least once a year. Nobody mailed me nothing. Nobody calls me. I've been with you I think for many years, and no one mentioned that hey we need to talk about your insurance policy. Like I said, no no no one cares about that. And this is good. Let's say I want to talk to someone and review the policy because like I said, we've been so long and no one called me say hey or mailed me some information or things like that. Because uh, like review the policy you know, but they never they never do that and I'm very surprised because like I said I've been with that company for so long. Okay. So what I can do? Let me let me transfer you over to JC's extension. Okay. If something happens and she's not available at the moment, definitely leave her a voice message and that way she can call you back if she's not available. Okay. Is it Daisy? What's her name? JC. Daisy. Okay. Yeah, JC. Yeah, because because like I said, I called like a month ago and I haven't heard from since then. I mean, at least mailed something, nothing message, email nothing. Okay, so let me transfer you over to JC. Okay, hold on. Okay.
