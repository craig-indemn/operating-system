Hello, hey Susan, it's Addison with Wyatt's Insurance. How are you? Doing well. I answered you on my watch. Let me switch over to the phone. Okay. Can you hear me? I can. I just called you because I got your message again. As you might imagine, since I've just moved in, everything's topsy turvy. But when I had message to about having the temporary license, and you message back and sent an email or message to you. I started looking into that to see which would be the more secure. And I didn't get an answer for that. I got indication that both were pretty insecure. But you know, as I after I called you this morning, I thought, well, gosh, if I send it to them one of those ways, they'd probably just email it to auto owners anyway, so security's out the window no matter. So I probably should just do one or the other. Do you have any notion about which is the better? So I will say that both our email and our phone numbers are both secure ways of sending any sort of documentation when it comes to your personal information because it goes straight into our database which is locked. We have a great IP program that we work with and they are constantly you know on the eye out for any any suspicious activity. So I don't think that you should have anything to worry about with that. And then as soon as you send us a picture, whichever way that you would like, I would send it directly to you auto owners and they also have a secure email that I would send it to. Okay, that sounds good. Now I I got a photograph ready of and of course now I have the the actual license. I've got a photograph ready of the front of it. But do you need both sides? No, just the side. Okay, well I can send that to you this afternoon. Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much. Okay, thank you. Bye. Bye.
