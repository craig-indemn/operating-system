Sorry for your hold. This is Cody to help you. Hey Cody, how you doing man? It's me Alex. Hello, Andrew. Hey man, how are you? I'm doing pretty good. I just I wanted to give you a call because I wanted to talk about the the workers comp. I believe I mean it's been fine with me. I just wanted to make sure. I mean, what was going on? I think I believe the the bill I guess and it's understanding because I think the lady told me it's something about like a renewal. Like renewing it I guess. What what exactly are you asking? I'm a little confused I guess. It's uh I was I was gonna pay my workers comp the other day, but the lady told me it was gonna be like three thousand dollars. So that's why like I was like oh okay well you know I mean it could be something else could be going on. That's why I was trying to get a hold of you to just see what's going on. And I mean if I just take care of it that way I take care of it as soon as possible. Is that how far behind she said it was? No, I mean I'm not behind. I think it's the finale or something that it's like a renewal. Like a renewal I think. The audit from like an audit or something or. No, I mean it's it's not bad. I mean that's what she that's what she told me when I called and tried to pay it because normally I you know I pay six nineteen so that's why I was like three thousand I was like I just. It's because she's asking for that twenty five percent down for the renewal. That's why. Ah okay well I was gonna ask that's why I was gonna be like well I mean I don't if I have to pay it then if it's something that I have to pay you know I mean which is obvious I do. If I could just do half and then if I could do another half or what could I do you know. Let me call them. I can change the billing account to a like a ten equal payment I believe. And that should reduce the amount that's owed. Do you want me to go ahead and pay it once I do that? I think it should only be a thousand something, but I don't know exactly what the amount is. Yeah yeah once you figure it out and it's something around there yes I want to go ahead like I told you I want to go ahead and go ahead be in the process of taking care of it. Okay. Do you want this do you want this policy set up on auto draft so it just comes out automatically every month? Yeah I mean you go ahead and do that yeah that'll be fine with me. Is the amount gonna be like like what I was used to paying or is it gonna be like when I to just to finish off as far as renewing it. Let me see the last payment you made was on the tenth of July it looks like. Yes sir so that's why I was trying to take care of this because it's already the eighteen you know so. Do you have do you have your routing and account number? To set it up on EFT. I if I need to right now. Hold on. Yeah I'm trying to go ahead. I didn't have to get seen outside. I have to come outside real quick. So sorry about that. No problem. Okay and I'm sorry to keep calling you man I know that you're busy dude I know one hundred percent you're good buddy I just I was out of the office until this afternoon so I'm just getting caught up on things right now. All right so I'm ready I have the account number I believe. Okay what bank is it through? This is a legacy. Okay. And what is the what's the routing number? My routing number is two five three one seven seven eight eight seven. Two five three one seven seven eight eight seven. Yes sir. Okay and the account number. The account number. The account number should be one zero zero zero so it should be three zero. Okay. And then it's four one four zero zero one seven. All right so the account number is one zero zero zero four one four zero zero one seven. Yes sir. Okay. Let me call Travelers and see if we can get that billing account changed over to a like a ten equal installment instead of that twenty five percent down installment plan. And then as long as the payments happen that or whatever it may be whatever it gets changed to am I okay to go ahead and make the payment while I got them on the phone? Yeah man that way I can make a payment you know what I mean as soon as we need to that way we can start it like I you know like I'm saying because I do not want to be behind at all. No I completely understand and I appreciate that. Do
