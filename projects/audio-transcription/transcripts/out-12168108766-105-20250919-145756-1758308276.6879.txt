You have reached the voicemail of Tony Terelli. I am unable to take your call at this time. Please leave a detailed message and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Please leave a message after the tone. When you have finished, please hang up or press the pound key for more options. Hey Tony, this is Rick Hendricks again at Alliance Insurance. I'm calling you back. Sorry on the select hospitality submission that you and Janelle are working on. I realize I did have another question and I forgot to ask you. It has to do with business income and the limits that I guess one of my team may have put on the quote and then how we're covering that on the policy. So I'm going to just send Janelle an email. I don't have your email, but I copy you on it. I'm just going to send her an email telling her that I probably think we should increase that limit and ask if there's another coverage condition besides one sixth monthly limit. I don't really like that too much. So I'll send an email. You or she can call me back today. You don't have to even call me today. We can certainly talk about it next week. But I just wanted to call you back and see if I'd catch you. So talk to you soon at your convenience. And like I say, next week is fine. Thanks again.
