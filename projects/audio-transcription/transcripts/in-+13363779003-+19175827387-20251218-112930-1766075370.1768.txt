Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. I am so sorry, I keep getting disconnected. And I please have Jamie again. Yeah, let me see if I can get him for you. He's probably expecting me to call back. Okay. All right, is this Robert? Yes. All right, is he fixing you up? Yes, I hope so. Oh, good, good. Okay, I'm gonna pitch you on hold. Thank you. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance Services. We appreciate your patience, and we will be with you shortly. While you wait, please take a moment to think of any recent changes to your personal or contact information. This helps us serve you better.
