Thank you for calling Nationwide. This is Mike. Can I have her name, please? Hey Mike, this is Cody Jackson of Lights Insurance. How are you? I'm doing good, Cody. And by the way, thank you for asking. And how are you? I'm good. That's good to know. So Lions and can you please verify to me the name listed in the policy? Julio Installer LLC. Okay, so how can I help you today? I set this up on auto pay online. I think on like the third of September, but it's not showing. It's showing payment method is direct. I'm sorry about that. Let me just check on that one. So. I mean I printed out the EFT form. Got that signed, which is a part of the process of setting that up. So I don't know why it's saying that it's still showing a direct payment method. Just a moment here. Well, one was the date that you have feathered one up, Cody. The signed EFT form. I think it was on the third. Third of September. Okay, let's. It actually says the date prepared is September the second. The signature date was nine three. Okay, so upon checking here, it seems like on September second, there was only an easy check payment. Oh no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry about that. Let me just check. Let me just clarify one six one. Yeah, I mean. You have mentioned that. I went through the process and printed out the EFT form that your website, you know, gives you whatever to retain on file. And got that signed, but it's still sitting here saying that it's still in a direct bill payment plan. Exactly. So. Thank you. Five eight two. So you're able to are you able to log in or are you signed in? Through agent center. I'm looking at the billing account in agent center. Okay, so you can see there nine on September second. There was an easy check payment. Correct. Correct. Yes, so it should reflect there that there's there's actually a back account added. If it's actually if it's actually for recurring payments, so for this one I believe this wasn't set up for recurring payments. For EFT. It was. I literally have the recurring electronic funds transfer authorization form that your system makes you print out when you are setting up the EFT. And I have it on file and I have it signed because I printed out in the process I made the payment and then I went in to set up the EFT. And I set up the EFT and I got your form signed and I put it in our case and this case in our system for this. Okay, understand. So yeah, let me just check what you're telling me. Exactly. Because upon checking here on preferences for for EFT, it seems like there's no card. For back account setup for this one. The bank account. Can you try the one? Can you set that up on your end now? I mean I've already got the form signed with this account number, this checking account information. That ends in five eight two three. Can you set that up on your end so I don't have to go back through this with the insured again? Because it should already be set up. Something failed on your end. I just stand up sorry for that one. So for this one, I'm afraid the only thing that I'll be able to do is to walk you through. I don't need to be much as I would like to help you on this one. You don't need to go through the whole process again. Yes, fortunately yes. Okay. All right. I will have to reach out and get the full account number again because I don't have that saved file and I'll just have to set it up again I guess. And once you set up on EFT, it will
