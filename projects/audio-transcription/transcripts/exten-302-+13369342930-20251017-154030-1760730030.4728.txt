Give me one second. Get that all pulled up. Okay, and I was wondering, um, I didn't know do I need to pay by check or I know there was a charge for credit card, so I was just gonna pay either by check or like an from our direct bank account. I don't know how y'all set it up. Yeah, you can do from a check and account with a account and routing number. Okay, perfect. I got that. So. Okay. Great. Give me one second. Okay, you can go with the account number whenever you are ready. Okay, the account number is six seven three two, three two zero zero five eight. Okay, and then the routing number. The routing number is zero five three one zero zero three zero zero. Okay, and what's the name on the account? Um, should be. Let me see if it says what what name is exactly on there. Um, I am gonna say it. Probably says Buyer's Enterprises LLC. Okay. Um, let me see if it. All that shows me on here is business banking, and I don't know if he's got LLC on them or not. Um. Yeah, should be Buyer's Enterprise LLC. I am gonna say. Perfect. Okay, and then so we're gonna be issuing the commercial auto, the package, and the workers comp. Okay, and how much does all that come out to be again? Give me one second. Like double check. So it looks like for um so your auto or your auto and your package is with auto owners. To pay in full for both of those, the total amount is three thousand nine hundred and forty five dollars and fifty eight cents. Okay. Oh, sorry, I meant everything altogether. How much is going to be coming out all at one time? Okay, no worries. Um, let me um so your workers comp with Hartford. Let me pull that one up because they're separate. So give me one second. Oh, I am. I didn't know. I am. I am sorry. I thought it was all going to be like one thing. So is it going to all come out like in separate transactions? I just want to make sure I had the right amount. Yeah, it's going to come out in two separate transactions. It's just because your workers comp is with a different carrier. Gotcha. Um. So it will yes. Um. So you'll see a transaction for auto owners and then you'll see a transactions for um the Hartford. Okay. And I am trying to get that one pulled up. Give me one second. So on this one, Hartford is. Give me one second. Hold on. Sorry, give me one second. Trying to get all pulled up. For some reason, their site is down. Let's see. That's fine. If you just want to um. Well, I mean, I am sure it's fine. I am sure it's gonna be the same amount that he sent. I just wanted to make sure. So when I saw it come out, I knew it was the right amount. What um, because I am trying to get pulled up. Was it about fifty four hundred for the workers comp or lower? Let me pull it up on here from when he sent it. It looks like what he forwarded to me to have any attachments. So I did see which quotes he sent to you.
