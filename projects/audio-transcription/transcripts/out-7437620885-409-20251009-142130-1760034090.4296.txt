Hello. Hey Claire, this is Corbin with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Yes, I'm hoping to hear something good. About your auto insurance. Yes, I've had a terrible day. I'm telling you, I woke up when I was supposed to be at work this morning, where I care to get that. And then I tried to get on the highway because I don't I don't ride highways, I'm scared of them. And I said okay, I'm gonna do it today just to get to work quicker. And it was backed up, so I had to turn around and go the long way around. And then a couch cushion flies off the back of the truck, gets stuck under my car, so I have to stop and drag it out from under my car. Oh goodness. Yeah. Oh wow. Well, here's what they told me. They said since it took the the past it's past the date of. You know, changing it. So the only way we can get it down is if I rewrite you. I can rewrite you to. Yeah, I can get you a cheaper rate. I don't know what you're going to owe on the other one though. So like. What will let you come back? They'll send me a bill on it later. Yeah, they'll just send you a bill later. Okay, as long as they'll send me a bill and I'll have time for it. Because the only thing I got in the bank and to my name is what we agreed it would be month. So. Y'all would do an auto draft. Yeah, so I need to get that routing and account number again, and I need to get a. I need to get a payment. At first payment, so when I send it down again, I'm gonna send it with a payment. So. And then it'll just and then you'll be billed next month on a draft. And then are you okay with paperless? Or do not. Yeah, I have a question. You don't have to do paperless. But you can. It's cheaper. Yeah, I'm good with that. But how can I get that thing that driver thing downloaded on my phone because it's moving the coast. Oh, I wouldn't worry about it. It's fine. Don't worry about it. I wouldn't even worry about that. Okay, are you sure I paid 123 today? That I'm going to continue to have insurance. It ain't going to lapse on me or anything, correct. Let me pull it up real quick. That way I got all the. But if you go paperless, let's see. Because once some points come off, I want to. I guess you could say upgrade my insurance. To try to get some kind of tow in and stuff like that in there. If y'all offer anything like that roadside assistance or whatever. You can tell it's getting close to the holidays. People are driving like they lost their mind. I know it. It's like you're saying, "Hit me! I need insurance money for Christmas money." Yep. I'm telling you, I've had a bad day. I really have. It ain't cheap. I've just had a bad day. It's like everybody's pulling out front of me. Nobody's concerned when you turn you turn signal on miles back that you need to get in the turning lane and they're like. They're in that big of a hurry. When they realize life goes quick enough. All right, let me make sure I get this. This one's 128 a month. Let me see. I got to change the date. I mean, if it's 128, I think I've got like six dollars in my savings that I can transfer to my account to go ahead and pay the 128. But I just I want to know 400% sure my insurance ain't going to lapse on me, you know. Yeah. Because they point the 200 and some dollars and. I just want you to make sure you're able to sign it this time. See what I mean? How long would it take if you send it to me in the mail? Or do I need to just come by your office tomorrow? Because you're right here, you're in Winston, correct? I'm in Clemens. My office is in Clemens. Okay, well I can come. I just come through Clemens, but I can come to Clemens tomorrow. Or I can help you do it over the phone. Okay. You'll need it. You want to you want to do that. Yeah, can you give me about 10 minutes and call me back? Because I'll be at the house and I'm kind of driving down a road where I just got off work. Yeah, yeah, just. And that way I'm not doing anything driving because that
