And how can I assist you with the policy here? I am trying to understand what's going on with the billing. If there was a draft or not on in December. And why? What's due and why did the client receive the bill? Is it for the auto home? Which policy are you calling for today? It should be just the auto. But it I mean the the notice says homeowner so I don't understand. There shouldn't be anything due on the homeowners. You already check it. Cecilia. Did I already check what? Yeah, you you about to check on the auto because actually what you can see here for this policy has been canceled already. Correct. There shouldn't be anything due on the homeowners. I am trying to figure out. Where this four hundred and forty eight payment is coming from. Oh, that's your question here. Okay. Hold on, we know. Will be meant so ever there is still a bill. Deducted and then premium bill. Because actually what you can see here the payment that has been done here for this policy is covered only up until December third. And the policy has been canceled effective on January first, so there is still coverage from January third up until. I mean from December third up until January first. Okay, so that was for December. Yeah, actually, the payment that has been done here. Actually, what you can see here there was a payment that has been made here. However, this payment that has been done January first was the coverage from November third up until December third. So that is why the payment the full payment that has been made here was only up until December third. And then the process the cancellation for the policy effective on January first. And supposedly there is a policy there is a deduction for that date. However, the process the cancellation. So there is still a. There is still a twenty nine days of coverage that has been covered for the insured. So if you are going to check here that one and that is the correct amount here because I tried to check here that one for you. So the October payment, the draft. What did that cover? The one that was taken on. October for the October that that covers from October three up until November three. So actually, you are using the coverage first. They are using the coverage first before. Before we collect the amount or before we collect the premium here. I need your help canceling the the umbrella policy.
