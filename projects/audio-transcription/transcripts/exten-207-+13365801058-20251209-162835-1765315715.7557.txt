Sorry for your hold. This is Cody. May help you. Cody, hi. This is Gale Jefferies at Colfax Furniture. Hey Gale, how are you? Doing pretty good. I haven't talked to you in a while. It's been a while. You've been doing okay. Yeah, pretty good. Good. House business. Well, let me just say, I can take a bigger share. It's been challenging. Yeah, I understand that. Yeah, I don't think furniture is on the top of everyone's agenda right now. Yeah, with the way the economy and the way the price of everything is right now, I am not surprised. I guess. Yeah, yeah, they were just fighting for our share. I get it. Take it from there. Do all you can do right. Yeah, yeah, got a couple questions for you. See, you've got a few minutes. Um, do you insure anything in Florida? Can, but there is a lot of issues in Florida, obviously because it's Florida. Yeah. What are you referring to a home, a business, a condo? A condo. Well, there is two things. Okay, my sister is also looking. To look around and see. My sister has a warehouse that she does like Amazon stuff in Florida. Okay. And she has property also rental retail property in Greensboro. Okay. She's going to be looking for that. But she sells things on Amazon and she has a warehouse for that. Okay. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Um. Yeah, I don't. We used to try to stay away. We used to be licensed in Florida and do it. We actually had a person down there in Florida that moved down there and we you know used to do more down there than we do now. Florida has gotten more and more difficult. I guess is the best way to say. Yeah. Yeah. Lot of politics here. Yeah, and just you know, just the constant hurricane threat and everything else. The price of everything it just. It got to be a lot to where we most of the time stay away from Florida. You know, if it's a current client and they need something and we can offer it or whatever, then we'll obviously help them. But. It's not something we like go after anymore. Okay, got you. Got you. Okay. But you mean if there is something you want us to look at, you'll be happy to try. Just I can make any guarantees that we're going to be the best option. It just kind of depends on what it is, where it is in Florida, and that sort of stuff. Yeah. But let me ask you about my condo in Florida because it's right on the water. Okay. What side are you on? Ah, the Gulf side. Okay. Panhandle or down south or. Oh, near Miami. Near Miami down she can get. Yep, okay. It's right outside of Naples. Gotcha. Okay. And you have it insured through who has it currently? I am not real sure. I have ownership with it with my sister. Oh, okay. All right. And she generally takes she lives here. She generally takes care of everything. So I just thought I would do some shopping to see if there is anything that we could do or whatever. Because we rented out one quarter of the year to sort of pay for all of the what I call the maintenance. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it's always expensive. Uh, when you own something at the beach and it gets eaten up the siding and the AC and everything else gets eaten up by the salt water and. In the air and everything else all the time all year long. It's a constant expense. Mother Nature is not forgiving. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Do you know about what you are paying a year right now? I don't know any of that. Okay. I just didn't know if you even insured anything in Florida. That sort of we know where. We have. I'll have to probably check with one of our personal lines people. Does a lot of coastal stuff. In North Carolina and South Carolina, and obviously we used to do some further down in Florida and stuff like that. So. I have to check with her to kind of see if we have a lot of good options these days down there. This is your cell phone number, right? Yes. Uh huh. See your. How's Mandy doing? She's doing pretty good. Good. Trying to raise those grandkids of mine, boy. Problem, problem, not mine. I got the same problem. I get. How old are yours? My oldest is fifteen and my youngest two are twins. They're seven. Oh my gosh, y'all must start it over. Yeah, I got a little age gap there. Yeah, yeah, I have I have a ten year gap between my. So I get it. You understand
