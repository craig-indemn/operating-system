Hello, hello. This is a Monte Dickover Alliance Insurance. Yes, I just want to give you a call back and let you know I do have one of my colleagues. They are going to be able to bring that renewal up to you today. I believe you spoke with him last time he was at office Jeff Edmonds. So he'll be able to bring that renewal up to you. Is your mailbox? Will we be able to drop it in your mailbox or would that be an issue? Yes, fine. What are you bringing? Okay, just a copy of a renewal. Oh, okay. Yes, fine. Yeah, you can drop it in the mailbox. That's fine. Okay. All right, thank you. All right, thank you. Bye.
