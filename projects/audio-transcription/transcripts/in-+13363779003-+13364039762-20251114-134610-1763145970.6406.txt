Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Ah yes, ma'am. Ah, we have our car insurance with you guys or you know through you whatever. And um, I need to check on some Medicare Advantage plans for two thousand twenty-six. Do y'all have anybody on the team that does that kind of stuff? Yeah, so we have um one agent and his name is Steve. Um, and he normally works um from his house. So he's not not normally in a location. Um, I can send you over to his extension. Um, but I'm not sure if he's going to be available right this second. Okay, that's fine. That's fine. Yeah, if you can, let me talk and just leave a message. You'll be fine. Yeah, and then also too, he's normally really good about getting back to you and stuff like that. So. Okay. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye.
