Okay, it's me. All right. Bye, Cecie. Cecie, did you say we worked on this before? I don't think you guys have. Okay. Gotcha. You know what happens if we click that checkbox. Yeah, I clicked it before. Nothing happens. It still does the same thing. And I've even tried to click like whenever I hit print quote, and that little blue thing comes up. I've even tried to hurry up and click that one, and it don't do nothing either. Yeah. Well, that did do anything. It didn't. Um, that's something. Um, let's do this. That's all. That is our default. But I don't think it showed up in here. Same PDF as our. Let's print that real quick and. Let's see. You've never been able to print from this. No. Interesting. Ever since I got switched over to the the laptop. Gotcha. And I told Cecie I think it's an Envy Grange thing maybe, like they don't like my computer. Oh yeah, I'm not sure. Anything. Yeah. Okay, it's got to be outside of this. So this is going to do the. Yeah, so there's two different screens for the ones for quoting and then ones for their actual system. Gotcha. That one seems to lock up on me. It won't let you out of the quote system. It won't now. Okay. Yeah, you just had to leave. Yeah, that's fine. And which one was it? The action. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, there was some in there. Infinity Remote Workspace. Okay. Yeah, I may have to log out and log back in. Yeah, let me check something. Their system's like super old. Yeah, it is. They have not updated it to current times. They're like I'm back on the first computer ever made. Yep, you mean you. Recording. I think to click on anything else, I might have to log in. Gotcha. Let's go and log back in. Okay. Okay, well. That'll work. Let's see what I can find. If anything, I don't know if this is going to mean anything to me. Probably not. The underwriting. Yeah. What's this one? No, it's the underwriting. Remote port. Interesting. Okay. Let me do one more thing. This one doesn't work. It probably is a question for Grange Mutual. Okay. Come on, open please. And the premium print quote. And that didn't have an printing thing, did it? I can go check the printer real quick. Yeah. No, that did not do anything. Okay. Yeah, it's it's probably going to be um. Be a call to them, and it may be something that we have to change. But um. I can't figure out what it might be. Um, and because this is a remote, it's a web interface, but it's a remote. Session to their software. It's however that is trying to communicate through the web browser, and print is. I don't know how they're doing it. I don't know what they're using. Um. But again, maybe something we have to change, but we don't know what that is. So I would give them a call and see if you can. I mean. They may be able to walk you through it, and if not, just let me know in a weekend that we can help. Okay. All right. Well, thank you for trying. Not a problem. Sorry. No, you're good. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Bye bye.
