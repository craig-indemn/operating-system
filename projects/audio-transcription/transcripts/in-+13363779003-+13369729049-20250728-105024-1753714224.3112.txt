Good, good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Now speak with Heather Johnson, please. She is out of the office today. Would you like a voicemail or could another agent help? I am trying to email her some pictures and it's several pictures, so I was just trying to see the best way to do that without sending her you know multiple emails. Okay. Are you wanting to are you wanting to email them to her? Are you wanting to email? Okay, her email is Heather J. At. Myallianceinsurance dot com. You spell all that out. Okay. Yep, so I've got that. I'm just trying not to have to send three or four emails with all these pictures. So I didn't know if they use Dropbox or there was some other app maybe that they use to kind of share pictures. Um, you can text them in if you like. That's the only other option I know. Okay, would she get them directly? How does that work? No, they wouldn't go to her directly. She would have to go and get them, but she she can. But she won't get them until tomorrow. Yeah, I don't think the timing is a is an issue. I think that'll be fine. Okay. Um. Yeah, I guess I'll just text it to her if you give me the number. That'll be fine. Okay, it is three three six. Three seven seven. Nine zero zero three. Three three six nine seven. Excuse me, three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. That is correct. All right. So if I'm going to text these pictures to that number. Okay. And if I text like a little note that says Heather, these are the pictures you requested, you'll get that as well. She yes she will. Perfect. All right, I'll do that. Okay. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Bye.
