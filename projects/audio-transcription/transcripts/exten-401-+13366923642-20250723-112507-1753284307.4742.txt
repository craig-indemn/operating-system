Thank you, Holiday. This is Heather. Hi, Heather. It's Ashley Williams. I'm Mister Call. Hey girl, yeah, yeah. So, um, the um lender reached out. She said she was shopping here policy. Oh yeah, there's a mess going on. It sounds like it. It sounds like it happened to get it by mistake because she sent it to my other co-worker because he she works with him all the time. And she was like, he passed it to me. He was like, she's already wrote this policy and. And then she second said she was shopping. Did she explain why? Yeah, so yeah, I'm like having a nervous breakdown trying to work. I just I'm on my lunch break right now. Yeah, hold on a second. Um, did Catherine say how much it needs to get down? I'm asking Corbin. Oh, oh. I think we were at 25. What I mean, what's the premium need to be? That's what she's trying to get. I did and she didn't reply. Okay, all right. Well, I'll wait and hear back from the lender. Um. Because yeah, I mean, she knew that we had bundled everything. So. Um. Yeah, so we're we're going to try and just increase your deductible. That's okay. Whatever we need to do. Yeah, like so basically the way she described it is whatever we need to do to get closing, let's do it. Right, and then after our close, we'll be getting back. Absolutely yes. Yeah, okay. I just wanted to reach out to you. She said she had talked to you, but I like I said I have not heard from you. So I was like, I'm going to reach out to you first before I make any changes. Yeah, whatever we need to do to get the closing. Okay, and then we just switch it back. I got it, girl. I got it, but I was like, I heard nothing. So it was kind of a little. Well, she called me last night at 5:30 with all this wonderful news. Gotcha. So I've been scrambling. Well, I mean, yeah, it's like all day. Wait until till five days till closing, right? Oh. Don't even. I mean, we did this way back. We did it like a month ago. Yes, because I am not this person like I'm. Right. I hate it. I'm ready for a week in advance. Like I don't do this crap. It's driving me nuts. Yeah. I'm sure. Well, I'll get it figured out. We will. Well, I'll just keep checking. Well, no, and we have. And another funny thing. So I saw an email come through where they. I who did we have? Um. I think it was Rocket. They had emailed requesting to update. Apparently the loan had been sold. That must have been on your other. The you still have that home, right? Your husband. Yeah, that's the whole hangup because he's in it and we can't get him out. So this is why I'm having to do all this work around. But Rocket Mortgage is the company that I'm going through now. Like well, it's Helmed Mortgage for this, but they use Rocket Mortgage. For this, yeah, because we had already sent over everything. You know, we I had the lender on there. And then it was a different lender. I can't remember exactly who now, but then we got an email saying to update it to Rocket. Yeah, that's what I was like. I'm just so confused. Because now we're getting a message. Join the club. Yeah. Yeah, like here we are. Oh, like shopping. Yeah, in the ninth hour. Yeah. Oh, because I already canceled my my insurance for my car cancels out on the 29 for all this to start. I'm like, what? Yeah, we'll get you. We'll get you taken care of. Yeah, so if we up the if we up the deductible, that'll get my amount low enough. Is that what she's saying? Well, I'm asking her what. Yeah, I'm asking her what the amount has to be. She's not replied back. Corbin's back there calling her now. I guess to see. Yeah, she's real good about answering the phone. Do what, hon? She's real good about answering like if you call. Oh, gotcha. Okay, yeah. She had just seen him this morning or yesterday. I think it was actually yesterday, and then he forwarded it to me with her on it this morning saying. You know, my co-workers already found this policy. So. Right. She was trying to get her. Oh, probably because
