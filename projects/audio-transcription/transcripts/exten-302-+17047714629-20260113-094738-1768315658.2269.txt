Thank you for holding. This is Bon, and I can help you. Hey, good afternoon. Good morning. This is David Humphries calling you from Elevate CCR. Yes. Hey, I was calling you because I received a email this morning from you guys or. Yesterday. Correct. On your policies. Yeah, which is really strange to me because I checked my bank and you guys sent my payment out. It's already showing processed. Okay, let me go on to their site. One second. Because we just got the notification as well, so if the payment was made, they just might be delayed. So let me double check. So for like one hundred and twelve bucks. Okay. Let me give me one second. When was that payment taken out? Yesterday. Yesterday or. Right now, just so I can look at it again. And tell you the exact amount. And it's been auto drafted every. No,pe it's been auto drafted. Every month since I've had you guys as my insurance carrier for the last two years. Let me pull it up real quick. Yeah, I do see it, which is weird that yes, it is an auto pay. So I am not really sure. Why? Yeah, so Frank Crum General one nine purchase gives me a purchase number debit card three six four zero for one hundred and twelve dollars even on January. Twelve yesterday. Four hundred and twelve. Okay, give me one second because this amount is showing four hundred and thirty seven. Yeah, I am. I don't make the payments. It's something that's automatic. So. No, yeah, and I definitely say that on the V account. So I am not really understanding why. You would have a pass due. Give me one second. I mean, if y'all need to take the extra twenty seven dollars or twenty five dollars, I mean, fine with me. So the one hundred and twelve that was taken for your general liability policy, the one thirty seven is for the workers comp, but they both should be on auto draft. Yeah, so I haven't paid more than one ninety three a month for a year. So you are telling me now it's more. So that wouldn't discuss anything with me. That's typically the down payment for the renewal. So you paid one hundred and twelve for your general liability to renew. Then the remaining of your monthly payments are only going to be sixty four dollars a month. Okay. And then because they always do. More more for the down payment to renew it, and then it goes back to your normal monthly payments. Okay. So then. Let me pull up your workers comp. Give me one second. So it all the premiums stay the same. Is like I said, your down payment is always more than the rest of the months. So your general liability is still six hundred and eighty dollars for the year, and your workers comp is still one thousand three hundred and seventy for the year. So for the workers comp, you do have to make your down payment, which is the one hundred thirty seven dollars, and then after that. One second, pull the rest. Your monthly payments will be one twenty three thirty. So if you did the one twenty three plus the sixty four, which would be roughly around the one ninety that you are used to paying. Right. Okay. So yeah, everything's the same. Is like I said, it's just the down payment for the first month to. Renew, which will be the highest. I would have assumed it would have automatically drafted just like we've done every month. Correct. So let me give them a call and find out what's going on, and then I'll let you know if we're good to go or not. Okay. Okay. All right, thank you. Thanks. Bye bye.
