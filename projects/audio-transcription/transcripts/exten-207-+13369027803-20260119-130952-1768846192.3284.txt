Sorry for y'all. This is Cody to help you. Hey, what's up, man? It's Daniel. I was going to see if I can make that payment for the workers' comp and the liability. Yes, sir. Let me see if they got those set up here. You doing all right? Yeah, pretty good. Pretty good. Good. See that y'all sign the documents for us. Thank you for that. Uh, do you have your checking account information? Yeah, y'all. Do you need the uh check the account or is that a payment I can do with like a debit card or? I can use a card if you want. I prefer just to use the routing and account number though. Okay. Uh, so you need the routing and the account number. Correct. Okay. Um, or could I make this payment with uh my debit card and then um I can get you that information here in a little bit. Do you want these set up on EFT? What was that? Do you want these set up on automatic payments each month? Uh, I think not yet, but like I said, um, I'm gonna stay on top of it all. Uh, I'll be making sure to call uh, you know, a few days before. Okay. Um, what bank is this with? It's a Truist. Okay. What's the? Is the card in her name? No, it's my name. Or do you need to be in her name? It doesn't matter. Okay, yeah, this is my card. Are you ready for the number? And it's Daniel Benitez. Is that right? Uh, first name is Swan. Okay. Middle name's Daniel and then last name Benitez. Okay. Mhm. And what's the card number? It's uh four six six one eight eight zero zero seven seven four eight two zero one three. Four six six one eight eight zero zero seven seven four eight two zero one three. Yes, sir. And the expiration date? It's uh ten twenty nine. Ten twenty nine and the three digit code. Six oh nine. And it's two seven zero three. Oh zip code for the card. Uh twenty eight six five nine. I'm sorry, it was twenty eight what? Two eight six five nine. Oh, that's right. It's North Wellsboro. Yeah, yeah. And uh, what I'll do is um, I'm gonna combine the billing accounts for both of the policies into one and then make one payment for both policies and then you'll just have one bill that you'll receive each month as well. And you said uh, and you said for both it was like two eight thirteen. Uh yeah, I can't remember exactly the amount, but it was just over eight hundred. Yeah. So what they normally do? Let me see. They've got these processed yet. Yes, it looks like they've created the billing accounts. So I'll combine these two billing accounts into one and then just make one payment for both policies and then you should just receive. Uh, one bill for each as well. All right. Yes, sir. Sounds good. All right. Let me know if you ever need anything. Okay. Yes, sir. Thank you. Yes, sir. Thanks. Bye bye.
