Hello, hey, good morning, Bertha. This is Jeremy at Alliance. How are you doing? I'll right you. I'm doing good. I am doing well. I wanted to follow up on our conversation the other day and see if you had made a decision or what you were wanting to do there. Yeah, I actually found somebody else and it's actually going to be cheaper than what we have now and I don't have to do that bumble thing. Okay, so are you wishing to cancel? At the let this renewal end, you just want to let it just cancel. You're going to have coverage somewhere else then. Yes, I'm still working on that though. I got to talk to them again today, just finalize some stuff because I got to get actually come by. Main Street and get my stuff to show exactly what I have so that they can match it. We think we got it, you know, and and I've actually even got more coverage. They actually provide like where Main Street only covers like if you if your if you have damage from pipes busting or something like that. This actually even covers like if there were to be. What I'm gonna say is like backup or something. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they cover they cover that and something else too so I'm I'm very grateful that it looks like it's going to work out better for me. Okay, and just make sure it's also replacement cost on your home. Make sure that they are able to tell you that it is for replacement cost policy. That's another big thing. What that? Well, that means that if something were to happen to your home, that they wouldn't pay you just the depreciated amount that they would pay you for a replacement cost of what it would cost for your home to be built. Currently and not what it was whenever the home was built originally. Okay, because sometimes. I think they said that too because the coverage is. Can you see my stuff right now? Okay, because I think they said it's covering me for like 180 some thousand dollars. Okay. Does that sound like what you're talking about? Well, that just means that you're insuring it for and they the most that they may be able to if you had a total loss, the most that they would be able to give you would be no more than 80 percent of that dollar amount that you're insuring it for. So that's where I'm just talking about. Just be careful with that. I mean, if you found a better deal on that, that's fantastic. But if it's a H O two instead of a H O three, that's going to make a difference. That's the policy form that it is. Okay. Okay. Are you are you? Are you actually at the location of Main Street or where where are you at? I'm in Pilot Mountain. You in Pilot? Okay. Yes, Ben. But there are very capable individuals there at the right there in Mount Area across from. Reef Community Center. There for you. Okay. Can you do a survey then? Or can you do me a favor then? I'm going to pick up those forms today. What you're saying, can you have them to have those ready for me and put on there what you're saying for me to make sure that I you get what I'm saying. What you're telling me to look out for? Yeah, I do. I do. If you could have that on, like have have them to have those that ready for me that so that they can do a comparison and like on the top tell them to indicate exactly what you're saying to look for because. I hear you right now, but I'm in the middle of getting dressed and I got to care for my mother-in-law. So I got to get out of here in a few moments. I hear what you're saying, but I probably not going to remember. That's what I'm saying, and that's very important. Right, and hopefully the company that's quoting you is also going to go over that with you. Hopefully, in great details where that will help you out as well. So I'll reach out to them there at the Mount Area location and make sure that if they if they are able to provide the documentation that you already talked about picking up, then we'll have it ready to go for you. Yeah, okay, and you said something about an H three. Whatever you just said to me, the important things to look out for if they can like flag that on the top of the page like a sticky note or just something so that that will be. I'll make sure that because it's good to get a cheaper price, but I still want to get exactly what I have and possibly more, but not less. Okay, all right. Okay. Thank you very much, Bertha. Thank you. Bye.
