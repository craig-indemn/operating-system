Hey David, it's Heather. How are you? I'm fine. I'm a little dopey because I've taken my pain meds for this hip replacement surgery that was on Monday. So if I say something stupid, just cut me some slack. So I'm calling to cancel all four policies: two cars, one homeowner's, and one umbrella. Effective yesterday. Okay. And where where did you go for everything? Say that again, please. What can form bureau? Okay. Yeah, form bureau. That's that's the only person that's sober in the room right now. All right, so I will I will send a cancellation form to your email for you to sign all three. Okay. Um. You said effective yesterday, so 10:14. Correct. And ultimately, when I when I called yesterday, it was basically to find out. What we what we're finding out is that we've had an Airbnb here for five years. And we're finding out that hardly anybody will allow that, and I know that Erie will not. I don't know if the the folks that travelers would have, but we've been told that they don't either. So we went ahead and found somebody that we knew absolutely would. Okay. Um. So I will send the forms over and then I will make a note. I do hate salutia, but if any anything comes up in the next year and and we can requote. It looks like Holly was working on a requote for for you guys for 111. So. Okay. But regardless, I'll get this taken care of and sent over to you. The email that I have is the david at davidrodwell dot com. Correct. All right, I will get that and sent over. Okay, sorry it didn't all work out, but everybody tried. Understand. Well, thank you. Sorry, have a good day and I hope you feel better. Thank you very much. All right. Thank you. Bye bye.
