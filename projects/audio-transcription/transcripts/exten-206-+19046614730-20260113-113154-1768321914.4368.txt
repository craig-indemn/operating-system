Hello, this Jeff, can I help you? Hi Jeff, this is Rebecca from Westfield. I was returning your call. Yeah, hey Rebecca, how are you this morning? I'm good. How are you? Doing fine. Thank you. If you don't mind, give me a moment. Let me get to a good spot where I can ask my questions. Hang on one second. Okay, okay. Yeah, I had a review yesterday with the customers, and a couple things came up just in the course of conversation on the policy I gave you FAB zero six six zero five two R. First question would be pertaining to the unscheduled farm personal property FD seven zero zero six. There's a current coverage amount of one hundred eight thousand eight hundred dollars. Just wanted to verify that items included in that coverage would be. They referenced a John Deere tractor valued at seventy thousand dollars. They also referenced a show saddle. They referenced a Kubota tractor, roughly two years old with a value of about seven thousand dollars, and a Kubota side by side. That their understanding is those are the items that were intended to be covered under that unscheduled farm personal property. And I guess I just needed to verify. Yep, these particular items would be items that would be included for coverage there, or if that line of coverage was intended for other items or other types of items. Yeah, so the stuff you mentioned that can fall under coverage F. We just periodically would like them to send in a schedule just so we can have that in the underwriting file that shows what that coverage F limit is supposed to be covering. So if they haven't done that recently, you could just send us in a list. But those type of items are fine under coverage F. When it gets to the point if it's a piece of equipment that's higher value like it's over a hundred something thousand dollars, then we would like to see that individually scheduled. So stuff like like combines, but I'm assuming these people don't have that. Nope, they do not. So the items that they gave me that I just gave you are fine to be included in the coverage limit under that coverage F. Yes. Okay, all right. Well, that's question number one. Okay, not so much a question as a statement. They have sold location two, which on the agent page. Let me find the the agent page of the I guess page two of the agent copy rather of the deck page. There's a location two Highway one hundred three Surrey County consisting of one hundred four acres. Also included in that there is coverage E twenty seven thousand five hundred dollars in cows. That is included or was included rather on location two. So to have those removed effective at the renewal. I mean, we could do it sooner. We just don't have a firm date on when it was sold. So it might be cleaner just to wait until the renewal and make one change instead of two. What needs to be done? Is there a change request that needs to be sent in and to where? Or is that something you can remove and? You can just send an endorsement request to CL processing at WestfieldGRP dot com and ask that we remove location two and the livestock if they all need to be removed as coverage D or you can just email me directly and I can take care of that. Okay, so either to you or to that CL processing. Okay, all right. That answers that. Let me see if there's anything else. I did have a couple questions regarding the umbrella. Are those questions you can answer or do I need to speak with someone else? There really two questions there. Yes, that would still be me. Okay, do you need that policy number or is that accessible with what you have so far? Let me just get logged back into my other system because it we have to look at the umbrella in a different platform and it logs me out after so many too many minutes. I'm not in it. Perfectly fine, no problem. Do you have that policy number? Yep, it is CAG three zero two four five seven C. Okay. Okay, questions I had. It looks like the only underlying coverage included in this umbrella is the existing farm policy that we just referenced. Is that correct? That's all I see under underlying coverages. Yes, that's correct. That's what I'm seeing too. Okay, is that all that's eligible? They have a couple of. Well, let's see. They have a couple of. Well, they have an auto policy number one, and then they have a commercial auto policy. Both are showing just Cheryl Dickerson and Donald Dickerson as named insureds. Are those policies eligible to be included as underlying coverages under this umbrella? One's written with auto owners, the other's written with National General or Intagon. So I believe we would want to list their commercial auto like through us, but if they have a personal auto, that's
