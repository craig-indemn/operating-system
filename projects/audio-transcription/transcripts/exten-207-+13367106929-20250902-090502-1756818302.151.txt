So if you are hold, this is Cody. May help you. Hey Cody, this is Crystal. I was calling about that interest account. Okay. You were supposed to check into it for me. What I could do for the audit, and they've already sent that I owe them. Well, we owe them nine thousand dollars. They already sent it to collections. Let me see. Because I emailed them. Just to say. Oh, this audit's driving me nuts, Crystal. I know, trust me. Let's see. I mean, hold is getting on to me, but I told him that I already talked to you about it, and like he says, well, no, I got this phone call, and it's we didn't he didn't he missed the phone call because we've been getting a lot of spam calls. Yeah. But the voicemail said that it was collection agency saying that we owed nine thousand to interest and he was trying to collect it. Oh, gracious. Let me. Send them another email. This is the what twenty three to twenty four term right. Ah, don't remember. The one that ended. Yeah, we never did one for twenty four to twenty five. It should be already done, though. Or would that would be this one? The twenty four to twenty five is the policy that's about there, and the twenty three to twenty four is the one that ended September of last year. Okay. So I guess not long we'll have to get onto that one too, but that's the travelers. Yeah, the yeah the travelers one will be coming up soon as well. Um, because that policy expires the twenty second. Yeah, the twenty second of September. So probably sometime you should receive some documentation on that one probably mid October or so. Um, I am. I am going to CC you on this email. Oh, dude. I am going to send this email. I CC you on this as well. If you don't hear from them, give it a few days. If you don't hear from them, don't worry about the collections thing. That will go away once the audit is reopened and completed. So just ignore that for now. Once the audit is revised and completed, that will go away and you'll just. Oh, or get money back or whatever based on whatever your actual numbers are. Okay. This is completed. Um. Is this the best number to reach you at, Crystal? Yes, and it's better to reach me because he is he just has started back working. He wanted to the phone. Okay. Three six seven one eight six nine two nine. Yes. All right, I am sending this right now. Like I said, if you haven't heard from somebody in a few days, probably by Friday or something, just let me know. I'll just call them if you don't. But this is typically the quickest way to get this done. Why it didn't last time I don't know so. Yeah. Okay. I mean we were out of town too. We were we were out of town. We've been out of town on the thirteenth. We hadn't been here so. Oh okay. Which I don't think I think you just got that email like last one. I am not emailed the phone call. It was like either Thursday or Friday because I tried to call but it was already too late. Okay. Well, hopefully this will take care of getting it reopened and then you'll just have to submit your documents and stuff to them. It might be online. They might say that there'll be an online. They may assign an actual auditor. I don't know. It's it's hit or miss which way they go with it these days. A lot of times they do it online only, but sometimes they'll randomly assign an auditor to it and you have to just go directly through them. So. Yeah. Just. Yeah, well, just whatever we have to do, and I just want to get it done. I you know we've been trying that for a while. I know it's been a struggle and sometimes with audits. It seems to go unfortunately. Now what am I going to have to have for the other one? That way you can try to like make sure I got everything ready on that. Like they'll want to see tax, you know quarterly tax documents and or whatever you have. See that's the thing. I don't have anything quarterly at all. I would only have like the yearly taxes. Right. So all you can do is send them what you have and tell them this is all I have and this is all. Yeah. So. Yeah. I mean, interest has been doing this long enough. They shouldn't give you that much kickback. If you do, then then let me know and I can see if I can assist. But yeah, you can only give them what you can give them. So. Yes. Okay
