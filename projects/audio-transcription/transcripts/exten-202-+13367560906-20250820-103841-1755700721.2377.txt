Good morning. This is Heather. How can I help you? Hey Heather, this is Regan Tid. I was returning your call. Yes, I just wanted to check in, make sure you got my email and see which direction you wanted to go. So I think with the renters, we're not going to do the renters policy. We'll keep it with. I'm using it as motivation to get rid of my storage unit because I think between all of that, I was like, I think we're covered fine. I just probably need to do that sooner rather than later. Yeah, and with a storage unit in general, there's 10 that extends to a storage unit. So that would be your personal property that would extend to that. But in that like verbage that I sent, Greer is covered. I think as long as there's not a loss within like the first 90 days. Okay. But I think I mean I I would say wait until you know maybe an apartment is in play and then we can look at a renters policy. Sure, that sounds like a great idea to me. Now this morning, my son went and got his or went to go get his license and that was not successful. So we have one more week with me being the chauffeur of the year. So. I was like, that probably happens more than you realize, buddy. Yes, yes, it does. So we do already have the DL one two three though. Jamie helped you with that. I do. Yep. Okay. All right. We'll just keep it posted. Okay, I will let you know when he transitions to being a sole driver. Okay, sounds good. Thanks, Regan. Thank you. Bye.
