Thank you for holding, Missus Heather. Heather Tommy Cole, how are you? Hey Tommy, good. How's it going? Good. I just sent you. I think I sent it to the right email address. You know we're moving and I'm renting a house for a year. And I need to get renter's insurance. And it needs to be one hundred thousand dollars. Minimum liability and whatever. But I sent you the information about who the other insurer is, that kind of stuff. And the address and all. Could you check and see if that email went through? I'm not sure I had the right email address. Yeah, I mean I received the first email I received from you. Yeah, but I didn't. Yeah, I didn't see the information with that one. Right. Okay. I think I just. I took a screenshot of it. Gotcha. Okay, so you're you just need a renter's policy. One hundred thousand liability. We don't write less than five, but it's only like three dollars difference from one hundred to five hundred. But yeah, I can get you a. Yeah, I can get you a proposal. How much do you have in personal property? You know I had no idea, but it's less than that for sure. No, that's reliability. That's not that that's what's required from from the. Yeah. The management company, but that's reliability. That's not for your anything. Oh, okay. Oh, for us, I mean, gosh, I don't know. I had no idea. What do you think? How many bedrooms is it? Yeah, how many? It'll be four bedrooms, three baths, twenty four hundred square feet. Is it one? I was going to wait. Is it? Yeah. Is it fully furnished? Well, it will be. Yeah, we we're going to furnish all the bedrooms. Okay, all right. Yeah, I mean that's. But I mean, I'm furnishing the. We we had to take custody of two grandkids. They're three and eleven, and you know, I'll have less than a thousand dollars in their two bedrooms because we're buying used stuff. Okay. No longer. Yeah, I mean that's what I'm saying like that. It's hard for me to say. You kind of just need to take inventory, you know, and. I mean, because some people have, you know, they go shop somewhere. Well, it's that you said the bedroom sets like confinement. Well, it's a big difference. Confinement. I don't know. Just you know. If I mean, if I was to say fifty thousand, would it be a big difference if I said one hundred thousand between the two or? It's not about one hundred dollars. Maybe different. Well, maybe. I mean, they're very they're fairly inexpensive. You're you're looking at maybe three hundred dollars for the year. Yeah, well, maybe just go with say seventy five thousand dollars of property. That's why I was. I mean, it was like on a three or four bedroom home. Yeah, that's seventy five to one hundred. Yeah, did you did you get the one I just sent with the screenshot showing the insured name, property location, policy number, all security. Yeah, I got that and the additional interest. Yeah, okay. So you guys are just going to be renting this home. Yeah, I don't have time to even think about buying something. We had to do this on a rush rush basis to get the pool and all that. So what about your your primary residence? The condo. I'm going to eventually sell it, but after we get moved out and I get it cleaned up and the paint, stuff you know and all that, I'm going to put it on the market. But I'll let you know when that happens. Okay, all right. So what who is staying there now? Anyone? Well, we're all staying here until the fifth of September. I mean, the ninth of September. We're moving on the ninth of September. Right, but who who will be in the house? Is it going to be empty vacant? You mean the condo? The condo. There'll be nobody living here. I'll be over here every day working on it, but nobody living here for probably a few weeks until we get sold. Okay, all right. So you you're not doing any extra construction. Oh no, no. I'm just going. You know, when you take stuff off the walls, you got to. Hey. Fill in the holes and all that kind. So you're only talking about the empty vacant for maybe a couple a month or so. Once you get all that done, you're going to list it for sale. Okay, I'm just trying to figure out what I need to do with that that
