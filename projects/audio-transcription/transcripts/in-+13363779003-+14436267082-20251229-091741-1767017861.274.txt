Then Friday and Saturday. I was trying to call. Let's get to the claim. I guess the payment. I had to get like a number off of on the envelope so we can get it. Or something like that. They requested a number, and I was trying to get in contact with them so I can give it to them. Oh, okay, all right. Who am I speaking with? I'm sorry, Isaac Seeger. Okay, and Isaac, are you? Did you, um, are you wanting to get your claim number? Is that right? No, I wanted to. It's like a number. Someone did a hit and run on me in a rental car. I gave that to him, and they said they need like numbers off like the envelope for the accident or for the numbers, some kind of numbers. I got the envelope the intercom page and. Yeah, they got they get intercom to give me like a thing and they said I give it to y'all or something. Okay, all right, Isaac. Um, hold on just a second. Let me get you over to an agent.
