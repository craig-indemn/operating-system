Good morning. Thanks for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hey, this is Hannah. We were just speaking on the phone. Oh, okay. Hey. Get my card. Sorry. Is there any way we can do routing an account number? Because I think that's the only thing they're gonna take. No, yeah, yeah, I can do that. Yeah, go just a second. Perfect. And can I pick the date that it comes out on, or is there like already like a preset date? Yeah, you can pick the day. Okay. Alright. Yeah. Do you need the routing or account number first? I can do routing. Okay. All right. Are you ready? All right. That's two five three one seven seven zero four nine. Alright, and the account number. The account number is nine one seven three zero two four three. Alright, so the routing I got two five three one seven seven zero four nine. And then the account number nine one seven three zero two four three. Yep. Perfect. And then as of right now, your due date is on the twenty-first. When would you want to um? Or what would you like to change it? That's fine. Just because like most of my bills are at the first, so it'll just give me like a little space in between. So that's good. Okay, so keep it on the twenty-first then. Yep. Alrighty, and then it'll draft today for the amount of two hundred and sixty with thirty-four. Okay, and will I get an email? Um, like each time I get like a payment like coming, or is it like automated like text I'll get. Um, I am not sure if they do like the text or whatever. Um. If they do email, that'd be fine too. Do you get your statements through email? Um, I let me look. I was like, I can't. I honestly haven't got any. Besides, like specific like receipts of payments. So the last one I made was for like two sixty on um. August fifth. Yeah. I think that's like the last one that I have. Like that was sent like a receipt. So other than that, I don't have anything else. Um, if anything else has been sent. Um. But yeah, email would be preferred if possible, just so that way I can have it. Okay, I can see if I can um get get on top of that um, but I will say the next payments would be like ninety eight and then. Um. That ninety eight sixty seven for one policy, and then the other policy is thirty one dollars with fifty cents. Okay. Um. Do you know if they've like been physically sending stuff in the mail? Um. Are you on paperless at all? Oh, actually. I am honestly not sure. So direct invoice paper, so they should be sending you stuff to your to your mail because you aren't paperless. Okay. Do you see an uh address that they have on file for that? Four three four Maple Hollow Road. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. Just making sure that's the right one. But yeah, that's good. Um, you can honestly just still have it coming that way. Um. If that's fine. Yeah, yeah, that should work. That should be no problem. Um. I will get this process for you, and then I think um I am gonna have to send you an authorization form just letting um us know that you are okay with it drafting. Okay. And I'll send that to your email as well. Okay. Do I need to try to fill that out like as soon as I can, or like would I have time to like wait till um I got home for the day? Yeah, no, no, no. You can wait until you can get home. That's no issue. Okay, that's fine. Yeah, I just uh my next client's about to be here, so I just won't have time like. Right now. Okay. All right. All right. Yeah, you have fun. All right. Perfect. All right. You have a good one. You as well. Thank you so much. Uh huh. Bye bye. Bye.
