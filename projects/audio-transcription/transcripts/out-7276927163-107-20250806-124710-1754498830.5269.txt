Oh, let's go. Hi Chad, is you know with the Lions Insurance. Hey Cecilia, how are you? I'm good, thanks. How are you? Doing well, thank you. As I was getting everything finalized, and I can't explain it, but if I change the date from today to tomorrow, well, can a little bit. There's a there's an advance quote discount the insurance company put on quote. Um, so that we can issue a policy in advance, not really like the day off. Yeah. So if I change it to tomorrow, it changes the price by a lot. So I'm going to leave it for today. Yeah, today's fine. That's fine. And the other thing was I did remove the snapshot discount and increasing it to thousand dollars deductible again because we're closer to the date. That advance quote discount either gets removed or diminished to the closer we are to the effective date. One thing I didn't mention in our email is you guys have three vehicles. Would you be okay me taking off to bring it down a little bit more closer to what I emailed you. Rental car coverage off of either both of the newer vehicles or one of them. Since like if something happens to one, you could drive the other. Um, you take it off the Mustang would be fine. What is what is the quote up to now? So right now is with a thousand dollars deductibles, no snapshot and the rental at thirty six sixty six eighty three. Okay. It's not like a huge difference from you know what I emailed you. Um, is that okay or do you want me to take the rental off of the Mustang? If you take the rental off the Mustang, what would it be? And so it's thirty six sixty six thirty five oh eight. Oh, so it's only like a hundred bucks for the whole year. Yeah. Um, I just believe it. It's fine. Okay. All right, and um, I need to put it back on there. Let me make sure that there's nothing on your driving record because I pulled the like the what we call the clue which is the claim history record. We're going to go in that you know of you guys haven't paid off any tickets or had any tickets the past three to five years. Like driving infractions now. Yeah, okay, good. And are both vehicles pay for the Silverado and the Mustang or is there a lien holder? No, they both they both have liens. Oh who who is that? Through. Um. First one is Public Federal Credit Union. Did you say Public? What was the first word you said? Public. Public's okay, that's what I heard. I just want to make sure Federal Credit Union and that was the the Silverado. No, that's the Mustang. Mustang. Okay, and the other one. I don't know. I'm trying to figure it out. I don't even know who has that anymore. To be honest with you. Um. Gosh, who has mine? Because they change all the time, you know. Yeah. Well, they're. Uh. Gosh, I'd have to look up the second one. I don't know if it's something that. You can email that to me. I'll try to find public information. I can get that added. There's no like cost difference to get them added at all. So I'll email you, um, a reminder so that you can send that over to me. Okay, so it'll be thirty six sixty six eighty three. I can take a Visa Mastercard Discover. Um, American Express. Okay, and the card is in your name. Yes, all right. I'm ready for the card number. Four four zero zero. Mhm. Six six eight four. Mhm. Four four one three. Okay. Seven one nine six. Expiration. That is uh ten twenty seven. And the security code. Six four three. Four three. All right. Is it okay if I put it up on auto pay from this card? You can always change it once you get your renewal offer next next year. Um, we can we can do that. Okay. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. All right, Progress is going to send you an email to to create your account again, um, or you know log into the one you have and add the new policy and for you to sign electronically the new auto application. Um, I said I'll send you a an email to get the lien holder information if you can find it and then the boat information for you to look at that for you. Okay, so good. Thank you, Chad. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bye bye.
