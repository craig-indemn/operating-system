Hello. Hey Dale, it's Cody from Lines Insurance. How are you? Yeah, it's pretty good. I called last week, I think it was, and left you a voicemail about the Florida. Yeah, I got it. Okay, just wanted to make sure. Yeah. Sorry, it took me a little while to get back to you. I was just trying to confirm some stuff, and we ended up completely withdrawing from Florida because it was just too much of a pain for us, I guess. I understand. Okay, I appreciate you calling. I appreciate you following up and everything. Yes, ma'am. Anything else that you need? I sure will. Thanks for calling. Uh huh. Uh huh. Bye.
