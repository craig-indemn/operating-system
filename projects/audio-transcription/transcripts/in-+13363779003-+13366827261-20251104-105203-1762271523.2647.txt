Thank you for calling Alliance. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Brandy, yes, dear, it's Daniel Williams calling, and I just got two quick questions here. We are, we are with Progressive now on our automobile, which we just have one, and our home as well. And I did pay the year six months ago on our home for the insurance, dear. And the Brandy the the other six months is at the end of this month, November for the automobile, and I think it was three twenty one. Can you check and see how much is owed at the end of this month here on your car? Okay, can me one second, I'm gonna get it pulled up here. Thank you. It's with Progressive this time. I thought she I wrote it down in the kitchen. Yeah, I think it's three twenty one in some change. For the next six months till May. Okay, so it looks like Daniel, you're at five eight zero four. Breaking wood. Breaking wood. Yes. Okay. Yes, dear. So it looks like the Progressive policy is for the 2015 Honda Davidson. Oh no, dear. That was already paid in full. Yes, yes, this is. Now your your auto policy with the Honda. C RV. C RV is with auto owners. Oh, I'm sorry, dear. So it's auto owners for the house and. And the auto. Oh okay. Yes. That's good, dear. That's good. Your payment is due December 1st, and it's for three hundred and twenty dollars and seventy nine cents. Wonderful. And I'm sure they'll send me some type of notice in the middle of the month, dear, so I can just call y'all and get it paid. Yes, it looks like you're not on paperless, so they will send that in the mail. That's wonderful, Brandy. And I do got another question for you, dear. We're good so far. Brandy, we were thinking about the last day of December to put in this home on the market and then getting a new construction that's being built now in Calabash, North Carolina. Um. Would auto owners be in the home in the car? Would we be able to stay with them? On the new construction. So you'll be able to stay with the auto, um, but you'll need a new you'll need a builder's risk policy, and our commercial side would be able to help you on that as far as. Um, for a newly uh, for a home under construction, yeah. Um. So you'll need to do that. I don't know if that will be with auto owners or one of our other companies because you have to have you can't have a homeowner's policy on a home that's not built yet. Oh, that's right, dear. We're not going close on it city to December the 31st or a little after, and we're not closing until it's inspected and completely completely done. Yeah, so you wouldn't get a homeowner's policy until you get a certification of occupancy. That means everything on the house has been looked at and you're good to go. And then of course you know we would do it for your closing date to start the policy. But yeah. Right, dear. And I'm not sure that that would be with auto owners either since it would be considered a coastal property. We would probably have to look at our other companies for that. Oh dear. I see. Yeah, because auto owners, I do not think that they insure any homes past ninety five. So anything on the coast that way, they're not going to insure. If I'm not mistaken. I see. Because it you you're in a higher risk of something for something to happen, so there are specific companies that will insure coastal properties. Wow, I didn't know that. Yeah, my brother's been in Little River for years, and he's never had any problem. Yeah, I mean that's it's four miles. Yeah, it's not that it's a problem. It's just that auto owners is not going to be that you're is not going to be a good homeowner's company for you because they won't do. Coastal. So there there is probably like five or six companies that do great insurance out that way. Now we are limited to some, but that's just something that we'll have to look at whenever the time comes. I got you. Okay, Brandy, is that something I can call and talk to you and you check on it for me? Um, actually, um, you'll want to ask for Tracy on that. She works with our coastal properties. I'm not sure her ins and outs and making sure that you have the right coverage and everything. I would want to get you to somebody that knows what they're talking about. I got you,
