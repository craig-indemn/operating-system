You order. So, are you whole? This is Cody, even help you. Hi Cody, this is Christina with Carolina Carport. Hey, how are you? I'm doing good in you. I'm good. Hi, I think I got a callback from you, but I was calling about my. Yeah, yeah, for Jesse. Yes. So he has his license renewed. And you guys were talking about with Ruby. Oh yeah, because he didn't have a valid license, so they canceled his policy, right? I'm not sure if it got canceled or you guys will be trying to see if. Well, I think the premium had gone crazy or something. Yeah. We didn't have any other options for him. I think because he didn't have a valid license, like the company or two we tried to quote. I think didn't he didn't have a valid license, so we we couldn't even do a quote or anything. So it's going to have to stay at what it is. I'm sorry. It's going to have to stay at the one with a high insurance. Is that policy still active though? I don't think that it is. It should because Ruby didn't say anything about it being canceled. Give me just a second here. I didn't think that he had renewed though. Yeah, we have a cancel case in our system for his business auto. Is it progressive? Yeah, because. You got papers from me. Oh, oh, because um. I think Ruby had requested that we cancel it. I believe. Oh, this is. I would have somebody would have had to because we had to get it. Probably might have been Ruby because she said. How the emails here for the twenty second of August. Renewals are for August 30th. Oh, you sent it to her. Oh, she just saying no. He is not renewing the auto policy. Yes, you can just renew the other ones, please. Correct. And they were going to be on auto pay. Any, be renewed or would he just have to completely or just not be able to at all with any other insurance. Did he get his license? Yeah, again. Yes, yes. I mean, I could try to quote a new progressive policy for him now. Did he not get a policy somewhere else? Not yet. He hasn't been working since he's about to spend this. Oh, I got you. I really not. He's going to be off for the rest of the week, so if he were to message her, she was she wasn't going to be here. I'm just want to let you know. Oh, Ruby's out today. Yeah, I don't know when she comes back for. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. You work in the Indiana office. Yeah. Yeah. I sent her an email this morning about Joel Mendoza Pagoda. This point, I think he's Pennsylvania because I get a lot of times people call me for him. Yeah, I know he's. I think in the Pennsylvania actual location or whatever, but I think it was a lot of times for some reason. I think the Indiana people helped with the Pennsylvania people. Yeah. But I sent Ruby an email this morning because his policy. Do you help with the Pennsylvania people? No, no. Do somebody else in that office. Because you try to help me because I need to get his policies reinstated. So. With Westfield, I can't make the payments. Like as soon as I issue the policies, I have to like wait. And with Joel's, I didn't ever make the payment first payment, but I mean he should have been receiving something in the mail for bills and stuff like that. But. Anyway, it started back in August, beginning of August. I think and nothing had been paid on it, and so Westfield canceled the workers' comp in the package. And I've got reinstatement approved now, but he's going to owe like forty five hundred dollars because it's three months on all on both of the policies. Yeah, so he's got to pay August, September, and October. I'll probably message to one of the guys from Pennsylvania because. I'm going to forward you the email that I sent to Ruby this morning. Okay. Where is that? Here it is. I think send it over to them. What's your email address? Christina C R I S T I N A. Dot V. Like Victor. At C C I H Q. Dot is. Yep. Yep. So Christina C R I S T I N A dot V is in Victor at C C I H Q dot is. So yeah, like I just said in the email, I I have his checking account information already that Ruby had sent me back in August. And I've got the reinstatement approved already by the underwriter. So all I need to do is get the statement of no loss,
