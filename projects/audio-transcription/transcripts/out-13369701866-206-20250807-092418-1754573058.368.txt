Dale. Hey Dale, good morning. Jeff Edmonds, how are you? Hey Jeff, good. Hey, couple quick questions. I've sent your quote out to a couple carriers, and I'm starting to get a few questions back. One of the carriers wants to know what sort of security measures such as locks, whatnot, might be apparent at the building. There's there's there's two automatic garage doors. One only gen and that's pretty much a coded. That's pretty much it. You know it's. Okay. It's just. Are they locked? Are those doors kept locked? They're just down. I mean, I'm the one that has the code. Oh, you mean coded? Okay, I understand. All right. It's just a garage door. You know it's got the the remote. And pretty much, I'm the one that has the you know code to get in. So when they're down, they're down and you know it's a. What happened if the power would go off? I wouldn't be able to get in. Well, that answers the question. That's okay. And the other question they had is in regard to the building. Would you have any idea as far as building updates such a? And I know you don't own the building, but they're asking. Is there's no heat and air in that building? No, is there? Okay. It's just it's just a semi floor. It was a floor and it's just a shell building. Metal older metal metal roof. Yep. Wood construction inside very strong very very good little building. It's just a. It's actually it's it's a it's exactly what I need for what I do. Perfect. Yeah. So but I'm just wanting to. You let me know when you get the number and then we'll see if if it's something I can I can you know digest. Well, I understand and I've got two companies that have said yes, send it to us. We're interested in it. That's kind of how they do it. So this is these are questions from one of them, and I haven't heard back from the other one yet this morning. So I will keep you posted as stuff comes back to me. Okay. All right. Good deal. Thank you. Appreciate it. Bye.
