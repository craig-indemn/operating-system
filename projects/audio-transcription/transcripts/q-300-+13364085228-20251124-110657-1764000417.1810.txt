And keep her holding. This is Holly. How can I help you? I was wanting to add a truck to my policy. My name's Tim Hooker. It's listed as Tim and Cindy. Maybe Timothy. I'm not sure. Okay. Let me get you pulled up. What is your address? 1044 Clark Road, Lawsonville, North Carolina. Thank you. Okay, auto's with oil owners, and we're just adding or are we replacing? I'm going to add one. I'll be taking another one off after the tag runs out in the next month. So I'm going to sell it, but I ain't sold it yet. So I'm going to leave a tag on it for till I sell it. Okay, so we're just. Okay, it runs out then. Yeah, I haven't got the truck yet, but I'm probably going to be tomorrow getting it on Wednesday. I just want to have insurance on it before I so I could drive it home. Okay, sounds good. So you want to add it effective today? Yes. Okay, all right. You have the VIN number. I sure do. You ready? I am. It's one G C J K three three D nine seven F one two eight three eight six. Oh seven Chevy Silverado. Yes. It's listed on the title as a gas, but that was a mistake. He said because it's a diesel, it's definitely a diesel. I didn't look at it, but I think it comes up. It comes up on that VIN number as a diesel. Yeah, it's a Virginia. It's going to be a Virginia title. Okay. Virginia, okay, effective today. What kind of coverage you want on this one? Just uh uh liability and comprehensive. Just liability and. Pull up your current policy here. Is it going to be about the same as my other truck? It's going to be a little. It's a little newer, so it probably be a little higher. Yeah, I'll have to look at it once it's processed. We can see that. Okay. Okay, yeah, hundred dollar deductible like you have on your other ones for comprehensive. Yeah. Okay, all right. I'll get it sent in, and then we'll be able to see how much it increases in the next 24 hours or so. Okay, I'm I can drive that without a tag when I got insurance on it kind of for a couple of days. Is that what I've been hearing? Like bringing it home. Well, your your insurance is covered. I'm not sure how they do it with the tag. Well, I Google it. That's what they say. Somebody said you could do it for a month, but you don't want to because they probably pull you over. Exactly. Yeah. They said legally you can at least bring it home. Yeah, I don't know. I would say you'd be okay, but I don't. I I don't want to give you advice that's wrong. So you're sure to be covered. Okay, that's the main thing I was want to make sure I had. Okay, very good. We said it. Thank you. Thank you. You too. Bye. Okay.
