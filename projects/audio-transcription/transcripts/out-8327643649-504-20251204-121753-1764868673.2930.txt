Hey there, Summer Adams. If you're looking for my dad, Randy Adams, his phone number has been changed to eight three two two one seven nine eight seven six. Again, that's eight three two two one seven nine eight seven six. But if you are looking for me, just leave me message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks, bye bye. Hey Summer, this is Holly at Alliance Insurance. I'm calling InterGar to auto renewal you have coming up next month. Just wanted to do a review on that to make sure everything was still the same. See if you had any questions, concerns, or needed another policy quoted or need anything else. Just give us a call back if you would like to do that review three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thanks so much, bye bye.
