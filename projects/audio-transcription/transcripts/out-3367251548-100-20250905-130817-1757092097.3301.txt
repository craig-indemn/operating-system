Hello. Hey Kathy, it's Greeny with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm pretty good. I was um wanting to ask you a question about. Um now I know it was supposed to be 10637. And it's done jumped to 108. And it hadn't been but a month. And I was kind of wondering why. Are you there? Yeah. Okay. You're quiet. The two dollars. It looks like it's a billing fee. Um. Ah billing fee. Why is it a billing fee? A billing fee. Billing fee up to three dollars. Maybe charge each bill. No fee is charged for accounts. On full pay plan. Or accounts on other payment plans when fully. Paperless is a. So if you're set up on paperless and you don't get that. Fee. So if you have a bill sent to your house. Every month, then they're going to charge you. No. It. It comes out automatically. Right. Right. Right. It's it's going to come out. Yeah. Automatically, but they're still going to send you the the bill every month. They are. Yeah. So I can take that off. I don't know that it's it's not going to. Effect. Um because you got a bill in the mail right. I did not. I have not got no bill in the mail, not as of yet, and it comes out on the 12th. Yeah. So I took the 10637 out. You know um. For August. Because that was the payment amount. Out of the checking account and then I had this in the mail. Ah, that's the only thing that I have. In the mail as far as. Any information other than my booklet, you know of course with all the. You know. Ah. The. What what would you call it the mail? I guess per se. Let me. Because I need to know what I'm supposed to be deducting out of my checking account a month, but I you know I'm not really liking it. Already jumped up two dollars, and it hasn't been but a month. And I paid it in full to get that you know deal or whatever. So yeah, I'm not too happy with that. Even though it's two dollars. So we can fix that part. I just. I know you that you're not. Um. Are you in town or are you? Yes, I am. Okay. If you can go to your email. I just sent you a link for auto owners to create an account. To see everything, you can go on there and click paperless. And it'll take that two dollar billing fee off. Because that's all it is is that they are going to send you. Things in the mail. Okay, can you do that for me because I'm not really sure that I will do it right. Um. Well, I can't like the link gets sent to your email address and you have to set it up with your email address. Okay, I don't really. We used to be able to do it, but they only put it on the customer side now, and I can't. Oh, see. Well, it was supposed to be set up that way, so it shouldn't even be this way. Well, I. So the billing fees. Are always on there, but it doesn't calculate whenever we quote it. The billing fees are afterwards because it's. It is up to you to put it on paperless to get that discount. We don't we can't do it on our side. Um, that's not something that we can do in the quoting either. Um. So if you want to come to the office and I can do it from your phone. On your email. No, I don't do nothing like that on my phone. No, I don't. Uh-uh, I only do stuff like that on my. Tablet. So what is my bill going to be? Well, if we don't take the paperless discount off, it'll be 108. Okay, are you going to send me a paper bill every month? And what's the purpose of me having it deducted out of my check? That's what I'm saying. If we can create an account for you on auto owners. And do paperless, then you don't have that two dollars. Exactly. Okay. So does that mean it's going to be 108 whatever? And I'm still going to get a paper bill each month. Yes, if you keep it at the 108 unless you create the account, do paperless and you don't get the bill. How about if I don't get the bill because I haven't got a bill yet? So therefore, I'm already paperless even without going in the email and going on that link. Sounds like
