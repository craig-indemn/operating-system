Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How may I help you? Yes, hi. My name is Debbie. I'm calling from Progressive Insurance. I was returning a call. Excuse me, for a customer. Stan Win. Looks like. A stew or. Had called. I'm sorry. I'm not sure of the pronunciation. T H I E U. T H I E U. Yeah, that's the person that it called. Let's name Win. Okay. Um, is that the name of the client you were working with, or are one of our agents? I'm assuming must be one of your agents. Um, the customer though same last name but first name is T H A N H. I don't see anyone here with that name. Could you give me your first name again, please? Of the agent T H I E U. Yeah, I don't see anyone here by that name. Huh. Okay. All right. Well, they listed they had given a cell phone number and then um, but it also said the agent and you guys are who were listed for the customer for the agency. So I only had one number to call back, but pulled that from the policy itself. So all right. Well, thank you so much. I could connect you to another agent. Maybe they could help you with that. I just don't see an agent here with that name. That's okay. I left a message on the other number that they provided. So I'll just wait to see if they call me back and we'll get it figured out then. Okay, that's fine. Um, so sorry. I can't help. No, it's okay. Thank you. You have a good day. You too. Bye bye.
