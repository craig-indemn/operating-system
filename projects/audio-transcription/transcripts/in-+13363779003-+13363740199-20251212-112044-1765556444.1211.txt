I don't know. Okay. Okay, okay. So the auto is pending cancellation for the fourteenth. Yeah, I mean, yeah. Okay, so are we going to pay it with a card? Yes, ma'am. Okay. There is a four dollar fee. That's fine. Okay. That's fine. There we go. So it's showing. So we'll do. Where did it go? I want to go back. This is all that's left. Okay, so it'd be one fifty three. Total balance. Okay.

That's fine. There we go. The card. Thing is saying it's a hundred dollar minimum, but I don't understand why. As it clearly says right here. Forty five eighty. But it's saying here you have a minimum of one hundred dollars due. I don't understand why that is. That's fine.
