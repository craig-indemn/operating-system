Hi Ellie, this is Tracy calling back from Alliance again. Hi Tracy, how are you doing? Good. How are you? Good. How can I help? Okay, I'm still working on this issue where the guy put all this property in the outbuilding. Um, I talked to him and he's actually not living in that travel trailer. He's renting a his friend's basement. So what I'm wondering is if I can write an HO four. And to cover his contents somehow, and then. Write that other structure's dwelling that you were talking about. Um, I mean yes, you can you can definitely write the HO four with his friend's address that should be fine. Um, and that then you can list the personal property under that. I don't know if you really need the other structures because that's only ensuring like that out house. Like it wouldn't ensure any. I mean I. I mean you could if depending on the out house, but. Yeah, it's a forty four by sixty outbuilding that he paid one hundred thousand dollars to have built. Gotcha. Okay, then that's understandable if he wants to ensure that structure. It just wouldn't ensure the contents inside. Okay, so I need two policies then: HO four at his current locate well using his current location with his contents coverage, and then write that other. Structure's dwelling policy is that correct? Yes. Okay, is that a personal lines option or is it a commercial line option online? I believe it's a personal lines. Okay, I will see if I can figure out how to get that quoted out and go from there. Okay, sounds good. I'm glad it worked out. Oh, me too. Thank you for your help. I appreciate it. Yeah, of course you're welcome. Be care. You too. Thanks. Bye bye.
