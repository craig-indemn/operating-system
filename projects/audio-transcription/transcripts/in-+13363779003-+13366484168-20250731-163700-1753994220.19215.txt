Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. I was speaking with Amanda. Oh, great man. I think I was speaking with the brandy maybe. Okay. Yeah, do you need to speak with her again? Yeah, I've asked a couple messages. At least send me her the the quote on my insurance and something happened to my email. I don't know. I never did see it. Never did get it. I actually was trying to get it sent back to me. So I'll speak to her or something. I appreciate it. Okay. Well, let me see if I can get her for you. Just one moment. Oh, yeah. Thank you. You're welcome.
