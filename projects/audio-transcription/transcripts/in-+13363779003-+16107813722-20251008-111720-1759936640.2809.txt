Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Uh, hello. Uh, my name is Lucy Sauer, and uh, I had received um some quoted renewal, uh policies um, for auto and homeowners. I believe it was Gary Belcher, uh, was sending these to me, and um, we decided that we would like to renew, the policies that he. Had sent to us. Okay, so y'all want to go ahead and get them issued. Yeah. Did we already get them issued for you guys? No, they have not been issued yet. They just they're changing from what we had before to a whole new company. All right. Let um I just sent him a message letting him know that you're on the phone for him that we um discussed with him. So give me one second. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome.
