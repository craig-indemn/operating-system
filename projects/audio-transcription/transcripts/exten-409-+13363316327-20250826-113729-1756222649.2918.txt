Scorbin may help you. Hi, it's Adrian with National General on the recorded line. How you doing today? Doing good. How about you? Good, thank you very much. I'm calling regarding the claim he filed on the bars in court. Yeah. And have you spoken with the policy holder or just the driver? Well, I was texting back and forth with him yesterday. I just spoke with the dad Tony. Tony's the dad. So I asked him, I said, "Have you filed anything?" He said, "No." So I went ahead and got got something in there. I think it happened on Friday, so I got the wrong date. I used yesterday, but it happened on Friday. It happened on Friday. Okay, I'll have to get the data loss change. Sorry about that. That's okay. Well, if I put 824, that's what Sunday. So it happened on the 23rd. Yeah, 22nd, 22nd. 22nd, okay, I'll get the data loss change. I reached out to them. Nobody answered. I can't talk to the child because he's 17. He's a minor. He has to be 18 for me to do a recorded statement. So I will just try to reach out to them again on tomorrow. Is the vehicle? Is it towed? Was there any property damage? Yeah, I don't I don't know. Do you want me to? He responds really well to texting. Do you want me to tell him anything or tell him to look for your call or? Ah. Have the the policy holder. So Tony or either Aaron can reach out to me. Okay. I'm gonna say Tony. She called me. And said, "She called him." Yes. Called you and would like for you to call her back when convenient. You try to call him today. Is that right? Earlier today. Okay. Okay. Okay. I just texted him to call you when it's convenient. I that's the thing. It's hard to get all the info while I'm texting because I don't know where it is now. I don't know where it was towed to or anything. And I really don't know if it sounds like he lost control, but I don't I don't know 100. So I'm glad. Hopefully he'll call you here shortly. Okay. And you're Shavonda, right? I'm Adrian. Adrian. What what number does he need to call? 336 331 6327. So 336 331. What was the rest? 6327. And I'll go ahead and put in for policy change and data loss change. Uh huh. So Shavonda is not working on it. You're doing it now, right? Shavonda might have been the person that took the claim. She probably did. If in a way, let me see. I don't know. It doesn't say a name. Okay. I don't know. Is that who he spoke to the file the claim? Well, when I typed it in, that's the name that came up. But I just told him to call you. Okay. All right. All right. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Okay. Bye now.
