Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Hi, I was just going through the paperwork. I just want to know. I talk. I think the policy was canceled on November. Some I just want to know what was going on. I like that. Do you need the policy number? Let me see if I can pull you up by your phone. Okay, yeah, the phone number is not working. So, what's the policy number? Five four, eight one four, six nine two zero zero. And you wanted to know what again? Yeah, I think I was just thinking is about like ten thirteen. I was thinking I was renew it. What I talk, he said it was canceled like last year. So I want to figure it out what was going on. I like that. Part got canceled. Looks like the bill for September didn't get paid. We didn't pay it all together. I like that. So you have um. Let's see, the policy was supposed to renew on ten thirteen. They sent a bill out in September. And when it was due, it was it wasn't paid. So they had to they canceled the policy for non payment. Okay. Is like anyway like I can we can start it and we can set up like the account the bank account we can pay it. Well, first I'd have to see if we can get this reinstated. Okay. You haven't had a loss um. Since the. Since ten thirteen. Correct. Ten thirteen it was due on then. But they were saying it was canceled somehow. Is even November I don't know. Yeah, this was back in two thousand twenty-four. So actually, I won't be able to reinstate this policy because it's had a lapse over a year. Okay. Yeah, and I won't be able to rewrite it either with another company because you you haven't had insurance on it for a year. Okay. All right. So I would check to see if you can insure this home with like, um, State Farm or Farm Bureau. See if they'll be able to do it. And then once you're there with them for a year, then you can come back to us. But I don't have a company that will take a home with a lapse. Okay. All right. Right, is there anything else I can help you with? No, that's it. Okay. I hope you have a good day. You're welcome. You too. Thank you. Bye.
