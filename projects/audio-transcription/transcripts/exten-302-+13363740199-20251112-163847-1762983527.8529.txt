Thank you for holding. This is Anna. I can help you. Hi, Anna. This is Chip Handy. I was trying to get a hold of you to find out about this claim on my truck. Okay, was the adjuster not reached out yet? No. Okay, I did send you an email with their information and their phone number. Have you tried giving them a call? No, I have. I don't do emails very good and be honest with you. And I'm I'm actually in the hospital again and. I just I need to get this thing resolved so I can have my truck to start feeding my cows. Okay, I can try to call the adjuster to see where they're at. Because once we assign it, we don't find out what's going on. So let me reach out to the adjuster to get them to give you a call. Okay. Do you know if the adjuster has has looked at the vehicle? I do not know. We just filed a claim for you guys and then it's handled through the adjuster. Okay. Yeah, we can't see any notes on our side or anything like that. It just shows us the claim and from claim number and that's it. Oh, okay. All right. If you would, would you please see if you can find out for me? Yep, I'll reach out and get them to give you a call. Okay. All right, thank you. Thank you. All right.
