Hello, this Jeff, can I help you? Hey Jeff, Dale full, how are you? I'm good, Dale, how you this morning? I'm doing fine. I looked over this, I think we're good to go. Okay. Great. I just I just want to I'm going to be closing it in a couple hours. I want to get to get it bonded so I you know get this moving forward. What I need to do. I think the only question I have, and then I'm going to resend you what I sent you already in a form where it can be signed. How do you want payments set up? Do you want to pay in full? You've got options there at the upper right hand corner. I don't have it pulled up right now. Do you want this on payments? You how do how would you prefer to pay for it? Can we sign? Okay, I I can do a full. Because actually the bill the bill will come from USLI. I just need to disclose at the top if you want it paid in full or put on payments. So if I if I check that paid in full box, I'll go through the application one more time. Make sure that it's like it needs to be. You're not we're not seeing any changes that need to be made, and then once I get it ready, I'll resend it to you in the form of an email. It will come from Congress sign. That's our e signature platform that we use. All you'll have to do is open it, sign it where it indicates, and that will get this bound and and you'll be good to go. We'll get the policy set up and you'll be all set. Okay, I just I just can set it up to pay in full. Okay, that'll be fine. Just pay in full. Hey, um, and the only thing the only couple questions: Do I need to do a credit card or a check? I want to make sure that it's not it's not based on me getting the payment to you right now. I mean, when we sign it, we're good, we're bound right. That's it, 100. The the payment will be can be made after the fact. Like I said, the billing will come from the carrier USLI. And we can help you make that payment if you need us to. But really, the payments between you and them, the policy will be bound. It'll be enforced. You'll be good to go. So okay, I just like said you know I'm just one of those people that that we can I don't want you know have and then the more next day we have a storm or something or whatever I'm just thinking. I only only get it bound and since it's it's going to be mine in a just couple hours. Absolutely, we'll get that done for you. I'll finish up my stuff and send you that email. Just process the signature and you're you're good to go. You've got good force. Okay, and then the only other question would be if down the road if I if I were to you know wholesale this out in about three months and I can get the the remainder refinanced. I mean, I get to pay for them on these premiums, right? Exactly, the unearned premium will be refunded. That is correct. Okay. Very good. It'll be refunded pro rata. Okay. Very good. All right. Good deal, Dale. I'll get to work on it right now. Get it to me so I can do this right before I head out. Got you. We'll do. Appreciate it. Thanks. Yep. Bye bye.
