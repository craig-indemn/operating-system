Hello. Is it Sid? Yes, it is. This is Amanda with Alliance Insurance. You calling back to make that payment? No, I was calling back to let y'all know y'all ain't gonna be able to make that payment. I just received information that I got to go to the bank and I got to put some money in there. Okay. Well, you can just call us when you can pay it. That'll be just fine. Okay, okay. All right, thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Bye.
