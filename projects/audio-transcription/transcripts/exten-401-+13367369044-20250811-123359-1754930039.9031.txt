I'm sorry. I found that. Yeah, so we're just adding. Is this the 2018 Roth Fuller? Yeah, what we're going to do? Add full coverage on under my name and my daughter. A wife daughter got this car also covered in her name, and you told me that her do not cancel that policy. Remember that conversation ahead. And she she don't want she don't want to cancel it. She want to go ahead and keep drop it down the liability and then at the end of whenever she's going to add. Her car on to it too, and then we could drop that this thing. Okay, and we have your daughter's policy too. Yeah, you got both of them. What's her name? It's Lynn L I N H. Palm P H A M and N G U Y E N. All right, hon. I'm going to get you over to our service team. They'll be able to take care of all that for you. Um. Let me ask you a question. Would it be would would it be better the way she did she get out of the vehicle or should I go ahead and do it now? What I'm sorry. What's that? With both policies, can she keep liability on it under her policy without canceling it? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I wouldn't cancel the policy. I would just drop it down. Like I said, I think we had that conversation about if you cancel the policy, it's going to be more to restart a new one. Okay, so I mean, are they going to help me with that or they're going to got to go? Yeah, no, they'll they'll. I'm sorry. Oh, they got to call her. I can do both of them on the phone. Oh, that now um, they should be able to. I'm not sure. Um, let's see. So you're adding a vehicle to your insurance policy, right? You're going to take that vehicle from Lynn to your policy, correct? Right. Okay. Yeah, so you're just you're just going to move that vehicle. Oh, it's in your name now too. I can't put. I can't get tags. I got I got all of all of it notarized. I just can't get tags that have insurance on. Sure. I mean, you have a policy right? The policy under Kim and your name. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so that's proof of insurance. Um. But yeah, I mean, I don't know what's bothering. But yeah, I mean, just you just want to add this vehicle under your policy to keep it simple. You just tell me you're trying to add a vehicle to your policy. Um. And then I'm not sure if they'll need Lynn to sign something. They they can send her something that she's done if they need that to just drop it down the liability. All right. Do they can they see everything that you worked on and? Yes. Yeah, there is a quote saved in progressive. The one that we did for you absolutely. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, just tell them that we. You know what? Let me just do this because. I'm so sorry. I just got back from vacation and. Oh really? Where you went? Yeah So, so there's already added as of today, right? Yep, okay. And then. All right, and then. I'm sorry, go ahead. And now it just drops the liability on the other one. I mean, just down to liability. Yeah. I want to get it. Yeah. And you can keep that policy open. You you're good help. I want to appreciate you. Oh, you're welcome, hun. You are welcome. Yeah, I just thought it would be easier since I had saved that quote, but it did not save and then trying to tell someone else what's going on. So I was just like, yeah, well, let's just do this. Um. All right, let me pull up. Lynn. Did you say? Excuse me, were y'all at Pauling? She said this week, this past weekend. No, I was there two weeks ago. Oh yeah. I was on a golf trip with about sixty guys. Guys, that's right. I know it had been scorching hot then. Oh yeah, it was. That's when it was like 110. Yeah. It storms in the morning. She had a big storm come through there. See now, Lynn is. That can't be her. Let me find. If she was progressive too. She what? Does she have progressive for her auto? Do you know? Yes, yes, and she she should have a a Charlotte address. Do you know what it is by chance? It's steamboat driver steam. Spell her so it's her first name is. L I N H. No L I N H L I N H. L I N H. And the middle name is P A K M. Okay. Got it. Okay, okay. I think it's sixteen, sixteen, sixteen. Well, wait a minute. That's not it either. This is a Wilmington address. That's not it. All right, L I N H. P A K M. N G U I M. U N U I M. E N. You don't have her policy number there. Yeah, I got her address. Does that work? Let me try it. Oh. Or her phone number. Do you have her phone number? Three three six seven four five. Seventeen forty five. I'm not bringing anything up. It's it's her name is T U O N G. Put T U O N G in it. C O U N G. T U O N G. Okay, here we go. Yes, that's it. All right, got it. All right. Twenty six, sixteen, sixteen. Okay. Bank. Yeah, I got it. All right. And you should um you should get an email from Progressive with your ID card and proof of insurance. Did you get that? Oh, let me look. What address you send it to? Email. D dot Yahoo dot com or what? Yeah, I got it. You did okay. Very good. All right. I didn't want to leave that page before I make sure you got that. All right, I'm going to go into Lynn. All right, and so for Lynn, for Lynn, we're just going to remove conflict collision, right? Yeah, just regular liability insurance and collision. Yeah, her other vehicle. Yeah. Okay. Very good. All right. So this vehicle paid off, right? She don't owe anything on it. Okay. And then I'll have her email address is Lynn M twelve at gmail so she'll get notification that this is being changed. Okay. Yeah, because she's still having the credit union as the lien holder. So it is paid off right. I'm sure if you pay cash. Yeah, yeah, I got the title in my hand. Okay. They just never did update that with the lien holder. All right, so her new payments will be forty eight ninety eight. Okay, I don't know that well. She should see when her email comes through. I call and I never know. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, so um, yeah, and then just have her you know notify us um. Whenever she gets another vehicle, hopefully it won't be too long. And but this is going to be as long as it's within a couple months. You know, like I said, um, it's just so much better to leave this open. Because like if she if she can't fill it today and then like in November gets another vehicle, um, and starts a brand new policy, it's going to be like a lot more. Because it looks like she's gone, like had I mean she has gone without coverage, but they just you know it's a lapse in coverage like for three months instead of having continuous coverage. She says she's going to have it the end of this month or in the next. Oh, okay for sure. Yeah. Okay
