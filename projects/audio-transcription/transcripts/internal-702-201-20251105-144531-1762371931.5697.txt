Hey Amanda, hey, hey, sorry I I called the military number in because I was trying to get a hold of Jeremy and I don't know what extension he's at when he's in military. So you can just call his. He says he's still seven zero one. Seven zero one. Okay, okay, that's good to know. Okay, all right, thank you for calling. Is that all you needed? I have the phone. I have one. Okay, that's fine. With slow. That's fine. That's fine. I understand. I understand. But he had sent me something to print off for a signature, and you know the guy had some questions whether what answer he needed to put on couple of them. Okay, well yeah, he's seven zero one still. Okay, all right. That tells me a lot. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye.
