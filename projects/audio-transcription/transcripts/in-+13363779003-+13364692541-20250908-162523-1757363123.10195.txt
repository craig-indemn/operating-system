Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance. It's Shannon Thomas. I hope you. Hi, this is Bailey Stinson. I just had a missed call from you all. I guess they leave a voicemail. Um, I haven't checked, but I think I have outstanding balance on a policy I need to take care of. Okay. Um. By any chance, were you speaking with either Gary or Brandi? Ah, Brandi. Okay, give me one second. I'll turn it over. Okay. Thanks.
