Hello. Hey Savannah, this is Brothers with a line. How are you? I'm doing good. How about you? I'm doing good. Good. I just called and I emailed you over those proposals last week, and I haven't heard anything back. So I want to make sure you did see my email come across. Oh, no, I did not get a chance to see it. Let me go ahead and pull it up. It was called out, August the 22nd at 10 o'clock at 10:10 p.m. August the 22nd. You might be better off just to search my name. If it's like my emails, so hey, god, I probably get 100 a day. I feel like. Right. I got washed, washed down. Oh, here we are. I see you. Yeah. Yeah. So. Yeah, I got your home and auto both with them, and it was pretty good. The complete package. Very. Finally, catches on one right now. Let's see. Let's see, 2,500. Automobile 11:30. Are you looking at the home or auto? Well, the so home was 2,500, and then auto was 11:30. Is that right? Let me see. So then, oh, and so then the total was 2,500 for both. Right, I was going to say, I don't think so. Yeah, that's right. I was like, I was like, man, that that seems a lot higher than them. Right. Yeah, that's. I was like, oh man, did I send something like that? I don't think so. Yeah, you know. Um. So yeah, for the home it's 1331. Um, and then the auto is 1225, and this is these are both annual policies. Okay. Gotcha. So that would just be that that's the total for the whole year. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All right. I'm like I'm like, man. The they cover literally everything. Yeah, so 2556 for baby for both home and auto. Yes. Okay. So what does that so when we say full coverage auto, does that mean um? Like if I have like an accident, like they'll get me a rental car and and all the things. Yeah, everything is on there. You have comprehensive, which is if it's comprehensive would cover like a deer hits your car, anything that's unpreventable. Or that you didn't cause the accident, so like if an animal hits your vehicle, if it's hail damage, catches on fire, a theft is under comprehensive, so that someone steals it. That would be considered comprehensive, and then collision is if you were the one to cause the accident, whether you hit a vehicle, house, a tree. You know, you were the one that caused the accident. Okay. With collision coverage, and then you have roadside assistance and rental coverage. Okay. Um. I mean, sounds good to me. I think, think both are less. The homeowners for sure. I know that 200 less. The auto. I don't. Yeah, I don't remember offhand, but. Okay. Who's got a little? The homeowners. Hey. Hey, anybody has your insurance for the auto? Um, progressive. I got full coverage. Let me, I can pull it up on my and see. Okay. Yeah, and see what your deductible are. Auto. That's just my card. Does it help me? Oh, it's like oh, you need to update to see all of your data. Okay. There you are. Um. Oh, it says try again later. Uh huh. Did you pay a month monthly for that? No, I want to say I just pay it once a year. I believe. Oh, is it a year? Okay. Yeah, I think so. Um, yeah, so oh no, it is once a month, so it's one thirty six ninety two. They draft it every month. Yeah. So let's see one thirty six ninety two times twelve, right? Let me see what that total is. Yeah, that's a lot more. That's like sixteen thirty two. Oh, okay. Yeah, so that's what that's plus for both then. Yeah. Let's see. That right sixteen. Yeah, one thirty one thirty one one thirty times twelve. But it's one little bit more than that. But yeah, um, so we can see that total twenty five. Yeah, so you will be saving um. Gosh, quite a bit. Um, the auto and the home. Yeah. Okay. Well, I mean, that sounds good. They all, they all, coverage and the same everything and they're cheaper. I mean. Can't be bad. Cincinnati is a really good. Yeah, Cincinnati is really good. They're like one of my top carriers. Okay. Well, sounds sounds good on mine then. Let me hold on one second, Savannah. Sure. If I do this monthly, what it. I was going to say I let's say one sixty because it was sixteen forty three for Progressive for the year and then this one said the automobile was twelve twenty five for the year so. And that they pay them full though. So let me. I'm just going to double check. Like if I change it to, would you pay them full or do you want to do monthly still? You do get a discount if you pay them full, but that's what I'm going to see what it comes to a month. Change it. We can we can just pay pay them in full. That's fine. Okay, if you pay them full. Twelve twenty five. It's twelve twenty five eighty six. I think you save about two hundred dollars by paying in full. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. I set that up when when I first moved out and the money was tight. Like yeah, I can't I can't be this kind of money out all the time. Right. I'm in a better place now. But. Okay. All right. So when did your policy renew with Progressive? Well, you don't have a policy now. January. It said January like twenty fifth or something. Okay. So we would just go ahead and write it and then you can cancel it. Um. And then the homeowners. Let's see. We have that. So do these both when we mentioned like inflation and homeowners insurance and stuff going up. Does that mean that these also still might rise? Well, yeah, for sure. But we are hopeful we're hearing that things may level off next year. We're just keeping our fingers off on our breath. But yeah, as always, you know everything. Typically goes up, but I mean, the past couple years it's just been. Crazy increases, right? The Mexican increases that we saw and it's been across the board. Like I told you the other day, it's just been. You know, with the North Carolina commissioner increasing the rates statewide and then. Um, that affects every carrier too. So they have to increase theirs. So yeah, it's been it's been like this for a while now. So we are definitely hopeful that things will level off. It's got to. Every well, you have to get in consideration. Like I guess when you bought your home, how long have you moved here a year or two? A year. Yeah, we just had we just hit a year. Yeah, when the homes are built, it's probably a little bit less on what you paid. I mean, the homes have gone up. You know, like if your home whenever it was built, it might have been like two hundred fifty thousand, and now we're seeing like four fifty. You know. And then same with autos. The vehicles autos cost more. You know your average vehicle used to be what like twenty thousand. Twenty to twenty five and now, depending on what they are, you know they're starting around like fifty now. Fifty for fifty grand for a car. That's love. A super roof. My twenty eighteen super roof better last me a little longer. Right. Yeah, I've got a Honda. That's what I'm like. You know, I went to a Honda and they were like, "Starting more like a Honda Ford is like forty. " And then you know it. I mean, they're just things cost so much more now. But that's where you have to take in consideration if something happens like replacement costs like if your home catches on fire to rebuild it it's going to cost more than what it did cost. Three or four years ago, right? And then yeah, if you if you get an accident. I mean, I know
