Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Hey Brandy, how you doing? Good. How are you? All right, I guess. I'm getting older. I am still walking. I guess that's pretty good thing, right? Yeah. Uh, I won't talk about trying to get some my insurance down because I won't have to. I'm going to have to. Uh, I'm trying to find. Policy, but I think I've got it at the house instead of a few weeks. At work, uh, and I do, uh, but I know it's something like fourteen hundred dollars or something next month. I need you. I don't know if you didn't got my name or number off his phone or what. Just verify your mailing address for me, please. 135, Carolina Avenue, Mount Airy, North Carolina, 27030. Okay. So it looks like your home policy did increase, and that's because they increased the coverage a limit. Um, just to make sure that you had enough replacement cost on the home. Um. I can look and see if there is any other companies, but we'll have to keep your. Your replacement cost will be around four hundred thousand. Four hundred thousand. Yeah, auto owners. Yeah, no. It's four hundred twenty-seven thousand. So all of our other companies will be around that same replacement cost. It ain't worth that much. Now I mean, nowhere near that. I mean, I don't understand things gonna look to replace it, but. Just I don't even hardly stay at the house. It is. My car insurance. What's my deductible on that? Let me see. Okay, now you know how lost you're not. Your deductible on the home is one thousand. One thousand. That's what I thought. Oh god. If we if we increase the deductible to two thousand five hundred, that would drop it about three hundred dollars. We can also look and see what it looks like if we moved your auto to auto owners for a whole year instead of you having a six month policy. Okay. Well. Um, because I only have, I only have two companies that will take home only. Um. Well, I mean, I'm. Right. Free and total because auto owners will take the home by itself, but I only have two other companies to look at with homes by themselves. All of our other companies want the home and auto together. Right. Well, I don't mind that if it's cheaper. I mean, I just things getting tough. You know that because I, nobody says that. I mean, you know I know that, but I'm really getting ready to kind of set my retire. And I know I ain't going to be able to afford a lot of stuff. And you know I hadn't had no claims, used no claims, and good driver. And used no claims on the house or nothing like that. Roof ain't got about four years old. I'm just guessing on that. Y'all should have it down there. I thought I had the paperwork here with me, but I don't. Uh, but I hope maybe y'all could do me a little bit better. Because I'm going to have to shop. Right, I mean we have companies that we can look at. It's just that. The two that I have maybe around the same price. Right. We already have the auto. You just started that renewal, so if we cancel that policy and move it to auto owners. Um. You know we'll just have to look and see. Um, your renewal isn't until August 7th, so I can get you something. Um, probably around the beginning of next week. Some different options. Okay, because I'm getting ready. We getting ready, take some time off, and that I can still be contacted. Now, as far as the roof goes, if it's four years old, we will need to have proof of that. Well, y'all should have everything. Y'all when I. Yeah, y'all got everything. Oh man, I mean, when I because I had another roof when I had y'all. And I had to you know turn it in price and the guy called you know whatever he emailed everything. Yeah, y'all have it in y'all records. I can't go through all that again. Y'all should have that. Like twenty twenty two twenty twenty one. Okay, so I'll have to look and see if we have it in our old system because we just have a new one. Well, that's not my. Y'all got it. I had it. I mean. How did you do it yourself or did you? No, no, no, no. With I didn't do no claim. I had to cut me come and do it. Okay, yeah, that's what I was asking
