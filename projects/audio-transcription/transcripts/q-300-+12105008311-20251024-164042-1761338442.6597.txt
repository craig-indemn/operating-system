Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Yes, my name is Simon Yeung. Trying to renew my homeowners policy. Kind of unusual situation because we haven't closed on the house yet, but I've had a policy because I paid for the installation of a swimming pool, so I want to make sure that there is coverage. So I've gotten like three different policies with three different amounts, and and then one I got most recently. It has the dwelling limit as five five hundred fourteen eight hundred. The previous one I got for the same term, it was seven hundred and three thousand. Now I don't know if that's because we haven't closed. That could explain why there is a reduction. But the premium is, was it much of a discount for that large reduction in the dwelling limit? But the premium on the latest one I received was two thousand five hundred and eight, and I requested a reduction for payment in full. To two thousand one hundred and thirty two, but when I go to pay it. Um. Back up just a second because I want to make sure that we're looking at the same exact thing. Um, what is the address? The address is ten fifty Cableview Drive in Morganton, North Carolina. Okay, and you are wanting to pay in full for this policy. Well, I want to know what the policy is first because I've been getting different numbers every time I turn around. But the one that I most recently got, I think either maybe it was earlier today. So the total premium is two thousand five hundred and eight dollars, and if I pay in full, it's two thousand one hundred and thirty two. When I go to the website to pay, it says the premium total balance is two thousand six hundred and thirty eight dollars, and there is no discount showing for payment in full. So we can't do a paid in full because we have to change it on our side to pay in full. And that does take. Well, I've been asking for that for a while now. Okay, so it looks like this policy is set up on quarterly. It was originally it gets renewed next week, and that then that's when I want to change it to pay in full. Okay, so the paid in full discount, paid in full, would be. Six forty. Make sure I am doing this right. So if we make the payment in full, we'll have to do it on our side. You will not be able to make a payment online yourself to get the paid in full discount because you cannot put in on your side. A an other amount to pay only we can because it's going to take once we change it to paid in full on our side it's going to take at least two to three business days for the billing to catch up and add in on that discount. But if you pay in full, your your policy premium will be two thousand one hundred and ninety one dollars. Even. Not according to the policy that was just sent to me. That is according to the policy that was was issued September eleventh. The one that issued October thirtieth. Oh, that doesn't make sense. The one I got. So if it's issued October thirtieth, so that must be the old. So I don't have a thirtieth date at all. So your effective dates are ten twenty eight to ten twenty ten twenty eight twenty twenty five to ten twenty eight twenty twenty six. The coverage amount on this home is seven hundred and three thousand. Okay, well the email I got the other day and now I'm now this is getting a little clear. The policy I got earlier the day was ten twenty eight twenty four through ten twenty eight twenty five. I don't know why I'm getting a bill for that. Yeah, that one was last year's. Well, why did I just get it yesterday? Yeah, that was. So the only bill that I see out here which is still quarterly, it is showing a current balance of two thousand six hundred and thirty eight dollars. Um. Six hundred two, but that's if you stay on quarterly. Um. That's the only bill that I see, and it's for this. Twelve thirty. Twelve thirty six this afternoon. And what where is it from? You said you got an email. Yeah, Alliance Insurance Services. Is that is that what you go under? Yeah, we are Alliance Insurance Services. Do you do online payment through some other a glove box app? Okay, so the glove box is probably not pulling in the correct one with the changes made. If you made changes recently. Well, I didn't make changes. I just asked for it to be. Renewed. Now again, I have mentioned that the house isn't finished yet. We haven't closed, but I wanted to continue with a policy, and pay it for a year so that when we go to closing, it's already paid and I don't have to worry about it. So I quite find that I don't understand what my bill is. Again, it seems I might have to wait until 2028 to get the discount, and I don't know what why I'm getting multiple policies for different coverages. So on glove box because we put stuff in there for you, and I'm going to pull up your glove box real quick and try to see what you're seeing compared to what I'm seeing. Okay. Because I don't want either one of us to be confused. Well, I'm pretty confused right now. Okay, so I'm going to try to fix that as best I can. Okay. So one of the documents is showing your declarations page for the previous year, and you can disregard that one. It looks like 1021. There was a change on the current policy, so we have to give you an updated declarations page. That is not a bill. Um. Ten. I want to see what. What's this one? Okay, that was a zero change at all. I think that was the system. Um. So the 2024 to 2025, you can disregard that um. Declarations page that was put in there, um or that bill. That that is the old one and I don't know why it was put in there. The one that you do want to look at is the one that says 1028, 2025 to 2026, and that is. The one that is labeled renewal term, not current term. See was that the one that was issued September 11. I don't see where it says renewal on here. Okay, I'm going to delete the. The one that you don't need. Okay. That way you're only seeing the one that you do need. Yeah, but the September 11th one. I'm looking at it as a PDF, so not off of the website. Okay, so there should only be. If you refresh or open it back up, open the app back up. You should only have two documents in there now. Two documents in what system? The glove box system. Okay. Um. Okay, I think that's what this is. Make a payment. How do I see and roll down? View and. Let me just exit out of that because that's oh here's the other website. Client. Like I said, since since I changed your billing. Um. You won't be able to make a payment in full and get the the paid in full discount today. I can make the payment for you on my side and you get the paid in full discount. Okay, let me let's see. Okay, when I go to I don't okay glove box at dot com policies. It shows the previous one, so. And it's just spinning right now. But if I refresh that, I should get the 1028, 25 through 26 policy correct. Yes, you will have. You will still have a current deck page declarations page in there. You want to click the second document. You'll have two in there, but you want to click the second one that says 2025. Okay, so it's not under policy details. It's under documents. Yes, correct. Okay, renewal term. Okay. Now what that document is going to show is your policy. Your policy premium as of right now, and then it does should show. Down at the very bottom. Oh sorry. What page is it on? Okay, so this document isn't going to show what the paid in full is, but your policy without the paid in full discount is 2640. With the paid in full discount, it's 2191, and that's the payment that I can make on my side, or you can wait until Monday or Tuesday and be able to make it on your side. Okay, well it's I think it's due Monday, so I will try again Monday and. Um, that will give me a chance to look at the policy. Okay, this is the one that yeah that I had in the PDF because. Same date, so okay. I did have a question about coverage. Let me see if I can remember what that is. Okay. Oh, equipment breakdown coverage. What does that cover? Yeah, so that is going to cover like your HVAC system, any electrical equipment that is plugged into the wall, and this is going to cover for things like. Give me one second. I like to get my cheat sheet out with auto owners and actually be able to give you. Exactly what
