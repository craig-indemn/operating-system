Hello. Hey Wayne, it's Heather with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm okay, Heather. How about you? Doing good. I am attempting to pull this back up. Bear with me. I'm sorry, I thought I was going to already have it before you finished. Oh, that's all right. That's all right. Actually, you caught me right before I was fixing to pull out. I'm in Western North Carolina, so I lose phone signal through the mountains, and so so I'm glad you called. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to take the call in about five or ten minutes. I got you. So we end up with the ten thousand deductible, which is a return premium of three ten. So total policy premium is two thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars. Right. And are you are you paying with a card or? Yeah, I was going to say, can I give you my Discover card and and you put it on that? Yes. Okay, all right. Bear with me. I got data. On my end table. Okay. Wayne Deborah. Okay, I'm ready when you are. All right, go ahead. All right, six zero one one. Zero zero one three. Zero zero nine seven. Eight four three six.Expiration. O three twenty six. Three on the back. Two two zero. Okay. And then zip code associated with the card. Two seven zero three zero. And name as it appears on the card. Wayne Moore. All right, I will email the receipt back to you. Anything else that I can help with today? No, that will take care of you know the Mount Airy homes here and and I don't think anything else to do right now. So let me see. Got taken care for a year. Yes, and then we can hopefully look again next year and see if there's a difference there. Rates are kind of starting to to plateau a little bit. So you know deductible changes do help, but we are starting to see those level off a little bit. So we can always look again next year and see if there's a a better rate. Okay. Okay, sounds good. Thank you, Wayne. Have a merry Christmas. You too. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
