This is George. Hey George, this is Brandy with Alliance Insurance. How are you doing this morning? I'm doing okay. Good. Um, so I I actually just got the phone call and told her what was going on, but she told me to give you a call. So a Merisave had given us a call this morning and said that they needed to be removed as the mortgage company on your homeowner's policy. Did you get a new one or get a? I'm working. Yeah, I'm working to refinance with the Merisave. It's just unfortunately we keep missing each other and this is a longer process. But we're yeah we're going to refinance the house with them. Okay, okay. So I don't know what that means. Well, you may end up. I mean, I'm going to leave a Merisave on the policy as of right now. Oh yeah, please do. Because you haven't changed at all. No, you haven't done anything yet. Think they called too soon, but um. Um, you may get a new loan number, and if that is the case, just give us a call whenever you do find all that out. That way we can update your homeowner's policy. Perfect. No, that's great. Yeah, okay. No, no, no. Thank you for calling. You know and and working through this. So it's. Yeah, it's a long process unfortunately. So, and my dumb phone keeps blocking their number and I don't know why. So that's. Just another story. Yeah, I know it's weird. Well, um, yeah, just let us know. I'm going to leave everything the same right now until everything is finalized. Oh, that's great. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Yeah, you're welcome. I hope you have a good day. All right, you too. Thank you. Bye.
