Your policy is not pulling up. What's the phone number associated with your policy? Well, the policy would be the HOA policy, not mine. Okay. So the the address of the condominium is three six three seven Maple Glen Lane. Charlotte. You said three six three seven Maple Glen Lane. Yes. I have a policy number, but that's. What what's the policy number? Zero nine three seven zero six Amazon Mary. The zero nine three seven zero six Amazon Mary. Let's see if I can pull anything up here. All right. So let's see what we have. So and you said you just are you you're trying to get a certificate of insurance. Is that right? Yeah. So I got a letter from New Res, which is my mortgage holder. And New Res is saying, according to our records, the master master condo master hazard insurance policy on your property is about to expire. For your protection as well as ours, we as required by your mortgage, your property must be continuously insured. Okay. Okay. So what I'm gonna do? Let me get you over to Amani. He's one of our commercial agents, and he can help you out with this. It looks like the the name on the policy reads Sir John's Hill Homeowners Association. Is does that sound right? It does. It's now under Cedar Management Group, but that yes, Sir John's Hill is the the condo development. I guess is the right word. Okay. Okay. Very good. So let me get you over to an agent that can help you out with this. Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Get his extension. Okay, hold on.
