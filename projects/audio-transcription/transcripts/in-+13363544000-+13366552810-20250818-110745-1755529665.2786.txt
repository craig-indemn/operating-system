Good morning. Thank you for calling Atlantic Insurance. Tell me, I hope you. Well, this map mayor calling. I had my insurance through you people. For the last year and everything, and I, I've got insurance now through the auto club. Okay. Did you have certain questions regarding your policy today? No, I. Anyway, I got it much cheaper through the auto club, so that's where they're outgoing. I went. I just want to notify you. Okay. Alrighty, um, let me get you an agent that can go ahead and take care of that. Just in case there's any documents or anything that you'd need to sign to um and that um. Policy, okay. Okay. Alrighty, give me one second.
