Yeah, sir. Yes, sir. Is that any better? Oh, yeah, that's a lot better. Good, good. Landline might sound a little bit better. So what I was saying, yeah, we'll talk through it, Nicky. We'll walk through it. That's no problem. You don't have to have a police report to file a claim. Oftentimes it helps, right? But you don't have to have one. So did you or the other car suffer any damage or any bodily injury at all? Anybody get hurt? No bodily injury. They just messed the front quarter fender up a little bit. Right quarter fender. On yours or theirs. Oh, theirs. I'm in my road tractor. Yeah. I'm in my tractor truck. There, yours. It's like no damage did it. No, no, no, no. They. I just ain't a whole lot hurt on one of these log tractors. A little too tough to hurt it. But I can explain and tell you what happened everything. You need to know that. Yeah, and what I'll do is I'll. I wouldn't be surprised just human being to human being. I wouldn't be surprised. I don't know the situation if they didn't take off because maybe they don't have insurance, maybe they don't have much insurance, or they're going to try to file it against you later and say it was your fault pay for my damages. Yeah, well, that's what I was thinking too. Yeah, any of those scenarios, I wouldn't be surprised. So what we can do, you can give me the information in the in the circumstances. I'll earmark it if you will, like hey, this is what happened. Our insured says he was not at fault. Then if they make contact by chance, then we'll let the carriers, let the yours is of course Progressive and whoever theirs is, we'll let them hash out who if anybody's at fault if it comes to that. But we'll on your end and me and you, we'll go ahead at least open it up to make them aware. Okay. Give me the give me the rundown. Okay, from my house out to 89, a one mile. Yes, sir. Caution light at Pinery at the Pinery's intersection 89 in Pinery's road. Yes, sir. You got the light there. All right, you. I was going to make a left hand turn to go back over to 77 to the Circle K to get fuel. So you got to swing out wide to the right hand side of the road, you know, to miss the stop sign and all of that. So I was sitting there with my turn signal on to turn left. There was a road. I looked both ways. There was a road tractor coming to the east, back toward my area, but I had plenty of time to get out. So I pulled out and when I looked back to make sure I was still missing the stop sign, that car was sitting there. A SUV was sitting there between me and stop sign. I put on my brakes real quick. I didn't know where I'd hit them or not. I stopped. They done a U turn right back around on the Pinery's road, and I didn't know exactly what was going. But I was sitting in the middle road. The traction trailer was coming, so I went on the Circle K. Here they come in behind me. Circle K said I'd hit them. I'd already pulled up to the fuel aisle. I said okay. I said, "Why were you sitting where you was at?" He said because I was turning left. I said I was turning left also. He said but you was in the turn lane to go right. I said young man it was a young. Man, I said there's no turn lane now. I said there's no markers, no there's no turn lane. I said it's either left or right. And I said I got a swing to make that right turn. I said why did you come in from behind me till I got done turning? Well, you hit me. I said I agree I hit you but it was your fault. And everything. He said well I'm going to call the cops. I said well that's what we need to do. I said but you're at fault and the woman young girl was with him said you hit us said it was your fault. I said no ma'am I said y'all should have stayed behind me till I got done turning. I said when I made that turn. I was already out in the road and I seen y'all sitting there. I looked back to make sure I was missing the stop sign and everything. I said y'all at fault here 100. Okay, I said there's no way out of it. That was like yeah but
