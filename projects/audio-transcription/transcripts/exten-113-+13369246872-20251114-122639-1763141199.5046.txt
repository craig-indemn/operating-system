Thank you for holding. This is Gary. Hey Gary, this is Mr. Raber. How are you, sir? A little confused. Okay. I just got a I just got an email on my screen that said. Your motorcycle we know is all set, which is I know what it is. It's the golf cart, and it said, "Thanks for being a valued customer. You're paid in full amount of 231 dollars. " And you're all set to go. No, they probably have not processed that thing that I sent in this week, Mr. Raber. Okay. So so just don't worry about that until I hear back from them. And normally their processes on this, they're not quick. Okay. So it's probably going to take a week before we get an answer back on that. But as soon as I hear something on it, then we'll just go from there. Well, they're not going to take another 200 and some dollars out of my account, are they? No, we can stop that. Most definitely. Okay. So I'll go I'll go in there and look at it when we hang up and make sure that doesn't happen. But that that should not occur. Just based on what we've done this week, but I'll keep you updated as to what's going on. Okay. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Bye bye.
