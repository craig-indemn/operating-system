Thank you for holding, Missus Brandy. How can I help you? Oh yes, hi, my name is Cynthia. I am calling with Lakeview Loans. I'm calling in reference to a flood policy for last name is Vang. Do you have a policy number? First name is. I do yes, it is one two five two five nine. Excuse me, I'm sorry, it's one two five two five five five one three zero. You said one two five. Two five five, five one three zero. Yes, that is correct. Uh huh. Okay, um, that policy number is not pulling up. So what was that last name again? Um, it is Z H, A N G. And the first name. Uh, C Charlie H A O X I. Spell that for me one more time because I don't think I spelled it right. Uh, the first name is C Charlie, H A O X I. Okay, so the name and the policy number didn't bring up anything. Okay, yeah, this is just weird. We have a separate policy for this insured, so this one just came out of I'm not sure where it came from, but we thought we'd call and just verify. What we'll do is we'll just reach out to the insured. But I appreciate your help. Yeah, no problem. Have a good day. Thank you. You too. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye.
