Sorry for your hole. This is Cody. Can I help you? Hey, Kelly. This is Nancy Bahado. Hey, Nancy. How are you? How are yourselves? I'm not too bad. All right. A question. I was trying to make a claim with my WhatsCom, and they're not pulling up my. My account. They said if I could call my agent again an account number. See. So you have a claim. What happens? Huh. My husband fell off the ladder and broke his elbow. Oh no. Let's see. When did this happen? Yesterday. Okay. Yeah, he went to urgent care, and then I tried to call orthopedics to schedule an appointment, and they said I have to contact WhatsCom before I can get an appointment. Yeah, sometimes they do that. Let's see. So you called Encova. Yeah. And they said, "What they couldn't find his policy. " Yeah, they couldn't find his policy. Because I don't know your name. His name. Okay. Well, they say what is the business name? I said, "Bahado Installer's. " Yeah, it's under his policies under his personal name. I can give you the policy number. What is that? It's WCB. One zero. V is in boy or V is in Victor. So WCB is in Charlie V is in boy. One zero four one six six seven. Okay. And I mean the policy. And he is he is cover right. Um. I can look and see if we. Did it as. I think that's what we did. Yeah, he's included on the policy. Okay. I hate that happened. So he broke his elbow. That's never good. Yeah, he broke his elbow. So, but he has a lot of pain from his his thumb. He can't touch anything with his thumb because he feels the pain in the elbow. Right. He can use his other four fingers, but. No. Well, I hate that happened. Hopefully, he can recover quickly. I hope so. It's always tough. This is why I always encourage the encourage the lead guys to include themselves and not exclude themselves. Yeah. That's true. Because accidents can happen to them just like the helpers, even if they're more experienced or whatever. You know. Yeah. Now do you know what this do you know what this policy covers like? Um, as far as I mean, they'll cover all of the medical costs from that. I don't know how that would work as far as lost wages or anything like that. You'll have to discuss that with the with the adjuster. Okay. I know for like the helpers and stuff, you know it will cover some of their lost wages. I don't know how exactly that works. You know, as the business owner. Yeah. Because obviously they make a lot more money because they're getting the majority of the paychecks that come into the company or whatever. So I don't know how exactly that plays out with you know lost wages and stuff from that for the owner. All right. Well, I guess a girl will call back and say, "What's up? " Yeah, I don't know. Like so, you gave them his personal name and they said they couldn't find the policy. I give him. I give him. I give him the business name. I thought it was under his business name or whatever. Yeah. I got you. Yeah, just it's under his personal name because you don't have an actual LLC form for that company. I don't. Yeah, it's just like a DBA or whatever. Like doing business as Bahado Installer or whatever. Yeah, so the policy is under his personal name in those situations. You know that would just be like a the DBA for the the business, like what you do business as or whatever. So reported at. Reported as the owner getting hurt or is owner an employee. The owner being hurt. Okay. Are you trying to call online or are you going to call? No, I was trying to call talk to an agent. Oh, I see. Yeah. So it would just be the owner themselves being hurt. Okay. Yeah, I don't think I could do it online. Okay. Yeah, I'm not sure. I've never tried to file one with Encova online or anything like that. Usually, I just usually recommend calling the company directly. Speak with somebody and then they can ask all the questions they need to ask and get all the information they need to get. You know what I mean. Yeah. It usually goes smoothest that way. All right. All right, sounds good, Cody. Thanks for your help. You're welcome. Do you need anything else? Not at the moment. Okay. If I have any other questions, I'll probably call you back. That sounds good. All right.
