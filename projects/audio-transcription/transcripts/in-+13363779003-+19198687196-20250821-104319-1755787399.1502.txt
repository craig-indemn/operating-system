Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Yes, can I make a payment over the phone with you? Yeah, of course. Can you just verify your address for me, please? Yeah, it's seventy four seventy four. Creedmore Road. Suite three twenty one Raleigh North Carolina two seven six one three. Perfect. Okay, it is going to be three hundred and seventy two with ninety eight cents. Okay. Let me give you a credit card. Okay. It's actually a debit card. Okay. It's four zero three six. Two three zero one. One zero nine eight. Nine zero seven nine. All right, and the expiration date for me. Zero one, two nine. And the verification code. Eight zero three. Now, do you need a billing zip code on that card? I do not. Okay. All right, I got that process for you. Was there anything else I can help you with today? What is if I decide to change the driver on this policy? What do I need to do? Um. What driver? Jesse Pelican is the driver now. Okay. Let's see, and what's your name? My name is Larry Tackett. I handle this account. For this policy. Oh, okay. Um. So it looks like I mean he's already the driver on this policy. So you would want to remove him. I'm not sure yet. I'm considering putting a different driver in place, and that's why I wanted to find out from you what if I decide to do that. What's involved? Yeah, so we would just need proof of insurance that he has another policy in force already before we. Can cancel or remove him from this policy. Okay, so you would need to make sure that Jesse had another policy. Correct. Yep. Okay, good, very good. Thanks for your help. You're welcome. Have a good one. Bye now. Bye.
