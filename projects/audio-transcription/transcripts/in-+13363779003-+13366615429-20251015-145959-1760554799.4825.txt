Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Yeah, could I speak with Gloria please? Ah, so she actually just stepped out of the office. Um, she should be back in just a couple minutes. Um, can I send you her voicemail? Well, um, I'm going to be stepping out. I've been trying to get in touch with this for the last couple days. We haven't seemed to been able to touch base here. She call I call and then she wasted day and called me. Yeah. Um. I'll just try. I guess I'll try to call her in the morning. What time does she usually get in? Um, eight thirty. But we normally open at nine. Okay. All right. I might just send her an email too. Okay, that works, and that way she can just email you when she gets back. All right. Thank you. Bye bye.
