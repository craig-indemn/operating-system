Thank you for holding. This is Heather. How can I help you? Heather, hey, this is Byron Carson. I need to get some renters insurance added to my policy. I currently have my homeowners and car insurance everything there with a client. Byron and Angela. Yes. Okay. All right. So tell me what's going on. We're needing it for. College. Right, correct. Okay. Tis the season. That's right. Unfortunately, because tuition comes with it, this insurance is nothing. Tuition is what's problem. Right. So what is is this for Elizabeth? Hall or is Byron? He's probably listed as Byron. He should be on our policy with his. Truck. Is he junior or the second? He's the fourth. Oh. It's confusing. I'm the third. He's the fourth. There's two more on top of that. I don't know why we did that, but we did. Just remind me his date of birth. Gee. Uh. Twelve fourteen. Two thousand five. My clothes. Okay. And do we have the address for the apartment? Yes. Okay, what is that? It's fourteen o two G Gorman Street. It's G O R M A N Street, and that's in Raleigh. And it's site two seven six zero six. Zip. Okay, so you said fourteen o two G is in George and then Gorman Street. Right. Raleigh. Okay. So usually what we do twenty five thousand personal property. Five hundred thousand liability. The apartment's usually only require a hundred, but it's literally dollars difference to just have the increased amount. We do five hundred dollar deductibles. Do we have a apartment complex? Like how they need to be listed on the policy. Yes, it's a. Ron. R H Y N E. Management associates. Incorporated that matters. Okay. It's one one one. Zero. Dash one o one. McKimmon View Court. It's M C K I M M O N. View Court. And of course that's in Raleigh too. And what's that zip? Two seven six zero six. Okay. All right, and best email for you is abhcarson at yahoo dot com. Yes. Okay, are we going to try and just put this in? Does he go by Byron? What does he go by? He goes by Hall. It's H A L L. Okay. Um, are we going to just try and put this in his name or do we want you to be listed as well since you're financially responsible? Well, we're going to be the one paying for it. I don't know if it's ad bad change. Just put in his name or not. I don't know. I don't really think it'll make a difference. Depends on the lease. So if the lease is only in his name, then we would only need to list him. No. Okay. If you or Angela co signed on the lease, then you would need to be listed. We did so that's fine. Okay. You can you can use me. Yeah, and usually that helps as far as like credit, just because they're young and they don't really have a lot established. So I will get this quoted and sent over to you. What is moving date? August first. Okay. So I don't need it today, but you know I won't need it next, you know ten days or so. Yeah, I mean I'll get it over to you today and then if you want to look over it over the weekend that's fine and we can finalize next week. Okay. Well, that sounds good. All right. Anything else I can help with? No, ma'am. I think you've got it. All right. Thank you, sir. Have a good day. You too. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.
