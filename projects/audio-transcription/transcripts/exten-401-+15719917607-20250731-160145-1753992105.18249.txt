Hello, this is Heather. Hi, Heather, it's me again. Hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, go ahead. Did you did you get my email? No, I didn't. You said I was gonna call me. I didn't check my email. Yeah, well, I've been waiting. We've been in a meeting, but I wait. I've been waiting on underwriting to get back to me. Um, but yeah, I mean, what I see is, um, if you check your email, you can see it goes up. The insurance goes up. And I mean, I was gonna, I was gonna get the underwriter to look at it and see. Sure, she didn't respond yet. No, I can try and call her. Yeah, because I cannot pay two insurance at the same time. I'm very sorry, I don't have extra money too. I understand. I've heard. I mean, I will get it. That's why I keep calling you. I'm sorry to bug you, but I need just to take me taking care of as soon as possible. I need to call last week. I understand. I don't. I um. But if you check your email and look at the quote, it's it's going up, so it would just make sense to keep it on there. You know. I'm sorry. Did it again? I'm with my email. I said with it removing, you're paying more for one vehicle than you would be for two. Um, check your email and I'm gonna call. I'm gonna hang up and call her, okay, and I'll call you right back. Okay, thank you. Okay, I'm gonna check and. I'll be waiting for you. I'm gonna call Pam now. Okay. Yeah, okay, thank you. All right. Ah, you're welcome.
