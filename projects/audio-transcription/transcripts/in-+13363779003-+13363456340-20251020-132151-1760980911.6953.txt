Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How you doing? I'm calling um by my account. Okay, how can I help? Um, I have a bill that's coming up this past due, but I scheduled my bill to be taken out on the past due date. I just want to make sure I'm good. Like I just got letter in the mail. Like I said, I already hit the auto. Well, I already scheduled the payment to be pulled on the thirty-first. But that's the same day they talk about my policy supposed to be canceled. So I'm just trying to kind of you know figure something out. Okay, what name is the policy in? Morgan Bohannon. Is it for the auto or the home? Auto. Okay, well give me one moment. Let me see if I have an agent back in help. Yeah.
