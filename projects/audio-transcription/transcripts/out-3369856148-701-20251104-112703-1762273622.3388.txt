Hello. Hey there, Doreen. This is just Jeremy. I'm calling from Alliance Insurance. How are you? Right. I'm just fine. How are you? I am spectacular, doing really well. Wendy said that she's been working with you on some things. I believe for you and a friend on some personal policies. Right. And have mentioned something about the HOA policy that you've got there, and wanted to see about getting some information from you if I may. In regards to that, and see about getting you a quote in place. Okay. Um. So my first question is, on those units out there on Forest Hill Circle. Twelve. Well, there's six units with two houses in each one. Yes, ma'am. Perfect. All right. So they were all built around 2001. Is that right? Right. All right. Um. We're only you're only thing that you're wanting to insure is the exterior, including the roof. Correct. Yep, I didn't understand that. You only your current policy, from my understanding, it's just covering the exterior of all those homes and the roof. Is that correct? Right. Okay. And with that being said, what is the roof age on those homes? Have any of them had the roof replaced recently? Uh, on four of them was replaced. I'm going to say two years ago. Okay. The others were I don't know if all of them were placed or not. Uh, I know. Let's see one two three four five. I think there's four. I know it's got full basements in a garage. There's two that just got. I don't even it's just a storage place under them. Okay. So the one. If I told you addresses, would it help you? When you're talking to me, would that help a little bit more maybe? I don't know. We start at like the one o up one o two. I think it's the first address. Uh, yeah, one o two and one o four. They're the one side by side. Okay. So the first one don't have a basement. The second one just got a cubby hole for storage. All right. One o eight has a full basement. With a garage. One o eight does. Right. Full basement and garage. All right. And what about one o six? We don't have a one o six. Got one o two, one o four, one o eight, one ten. Oh, you're exactly right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was going to okay. So one ten. What about one ten? One ten's got a full garage and a basement. Okay. And one fourteen has a full. And most of these people like the one o eight, one ten. There's just one person they've all lost their wife or husband once. So just one person in them. Got you. Okay, one fourteen's got a. Got a full basement. Okay. And one is there just a full basement. It's got a garage. Okay. And one sixteen. I see they got a full full basement garage. Okay. And one twenty four. They just moved out and they're going to rent that. It has got a. It's got a garage door down there, but I don't even think you could pull a car in it, and it's just up like a maybe a half of the basement. Okay. And the next one twenty six is Felis. They don't have she just plain level no garage. She's on a slab. Right. Well, we've got cross space under them. Okay, cross space on that one. Got you. Yeah. And cross space on one thirty. All right. Um. Nine's a cross space one thirty two. Uh, one thirty six cross space. All right. And one thirty eight's cross space. All right. Excellent. So the ones that have the full basement garage would make sense if they were valued a little bit higher. Right. On those. And okay. Um. The deductible, it looks like for all of these, is right at a thousand dollars. Right. You want to keep those deductibles that low, or do you want to increase the deductibles to have a lower premium? What works best for the HOA there. Probably just leave it at a thousand. Okay. All right. And are these considered apartments or they considered condos? Or they're townhouses. Townhouses, townhouses. Right. County. Yeah, we buy them. And then like you know we own five foot out all the way around them and they're hooked hooked together, but we buy. Well, I saw one of the girls yesterday. She didn't. They call it renters insurance that we buy for inside. Now, dude, they're they're responsible for that though, right? Yeah, we're yeah we're
