Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hi, I'm calling back for um, Bert. Okay, for Corbin. Yep. All right, he is already gone for today. Do you want to leave a voicemail for him? Wait for it. I'm pretty sure he is. Let me see here. Oh, he called me at one thirty two. Okay, well let me transfer you over. Maybe he hasn't gone yet. Hold on. Oh, okay.
