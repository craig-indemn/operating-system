Hey Carmen. Hey, um, so there is a lapse, um, but they're telling me that I'm going to have to pay another thousand dollars to get playback. Why? Because they're going to make you get a whole new tag. Yeah. Oh my gosh. That's just ridiculous. Did they say that they had sent you something or what? They say. Um, he gave me a paper and it says, um. No notice. Mailed plate revocation, but I don't have that. And then there is an effective DT on FS one after termination DT FS expiration date of eleven five. Eleven five. Yeah, and then there was an effective DT on FS one after termination of eleven eleven. What in the world? So that's after we started the new policy. Yeah. Do you want to? Do you want me to bring you this paper? There's a bunch of dates on here. Yeah, you can you can drop it off with us and I mean I can send it at this one. So there's two different. Dates. There's a bunch of different dates on here. And they're after. Oh gosh. When was the new policy issued? October twenty second. Before these November dates. So there's nothing about the original cancellation date of the old policy back in September. Yeah, there's a September date on here. Um, and that was that's the. It says auto owner insurance company terminated insurance on nine nine. Which is the old policy. Yeah, and then it says. But then they never received anything from that. It said DMV notice ten thirteen and then to avoid plate revocation eleven twelve. That's the so that is the letter that you should have got in the mail. That one. That you just mentioned. That's the one that you should have received in the mail. That we could have then had this FS one form sent. Yeah, let me here. I am pulling in and I'll show you this letter. Okay. All right. Bye.
