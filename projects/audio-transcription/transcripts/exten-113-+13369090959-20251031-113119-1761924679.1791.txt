What insurance is scary? Hi Gary, this is Andre Buchan. I just got a message about a renewal of our policy. Hey Andre. Um, I I need to know some details on what you got going on there at the house. Okay. Have you got any of your? Have you got number one? Have you got a commercial policy? Commercial policy. Just a liability policy for your business. No. Okay, and what kind of? I noticed the the sheds in the barn on the back of the property there. What are you using those for? Storage. And is that is that related to your business or not? Yes. Okay. And then what about the van that's on the on your auto policy? Do you use that in delivery? We use it partially for business. Yes. Okay. Okay, auto. Now the auto renews on the eight, but the homeowner does not renew until the end. I think. In December. So do you want us to quote both of them together or do you want to leave the auto where it's at or how do you want to do that? Well, if you get me a better rate, we'll just quote them together. Let's let's do it. And then how is the van titled? Is it titled to you or titled to the business? It's personal. Yeah, titled to me. Okay. But business is just sole proprietorship. It's not a registered corporation or something like that. Okay. I'm making some notes here. Well, if you're using the van at all to deliver anything, then we need to upgrade the coverage on your current auto policy. And it will increase it probably forty fifty dollars a year. Two fifty a year, they said. Fifty dollars a year. Fifty dollars a year. Yeah. And if you're using it at all for any kind of business related stuff, then you definitely should want to put that on there. Right, it's not deliveries, but we we use it to bring in the some stuff to to our house like supplies and. Our purchases. Okay, and and now as far as the coverage on the house, I looked at the the policy that's getting ready to renew. Based based on the square footage, they've got you way underinsured on that policy. You're going to you're going to need to upgrade that if you want replacement cost on there. You're going to need to upgrade it. It's going to have to go from the four sixty six. Probably two hundred thousand dollars to rebuild your home. Four sixty six. It was our. Well, four sixty six is is what your current is and the the tax card. Is showing like six fifty on the structure and it's probably going to be higher than that when we do the replacement cost valuation on it. Is is it four sixty six? You're talking about square footage or what? No, I'm talking about that's the coverage amount that the that your expiring policy is written at. Four sixty six thousand dollars, right? Yes. Okay, well our tax valuation raised dramatically this year, so it was like it raised for like from three something to like nine hundred something. Well, that's probably including the property as well or the the acreage that you've got on there. Okay. Is it is it optional? We will we will run those rates based on a replacement value. Yeah. And I won't know what that is until we get those quotes back, but I'll certainly touch base with you on that. Okay. Is it optional? We can we can choose whatever value we want to insure. You can you can we're limited on the companies that we can use for that, but you certainly can do that. So insurance will be based on evaluation figure, right? On the square footage. On the square footage. Yes. But the square footage didn't change. Right. So, but the the cost to build a home now is more than it was when you started that policy. Right. Okay. Well, I mean, let me do it right again. You you definitely want to make sure you've got enough coverage on there that if if something happens that you could rebuild back. Yes. Okay. Now let me ask you this: as far as the, I know it's a rather new home, but have you done any upgrades to the house as far as the heating, the electric, and and all that. No, everything you get footage. You know it was good things original. Yep. You don't have. Do you have any animals on the property? No animals. Okay. What about? Are you leasing any of it out or anything like that? Lease. Do you lease any land to anybody? No. Okay. Okay, well give me just give me a couple days and I'll call you back the first of the week. And and see what we can come up with. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Mhm
