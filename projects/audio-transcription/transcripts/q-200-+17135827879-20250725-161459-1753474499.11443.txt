We're holding together. Hi, I'm wondering if you can help me with a question I have. So, I have a policy and I have myself and my Subaru that I own on the policy. My daughter from who has been living in Texas has moved here to North Carolina and is getting like a North Carolina license. And she's buying a car from her other parent who is in Texas, but won't have that for another two weeks. But that parent wants me to put her on my insurance. Does that make sense? And I'm just trying to figure out kind of put her on my insurance. Who is your agent? Who insures her? Who is your agent? I don't know. Would that be on my? I'm looking at alliance. Let me pull your account up. Service. Where would that number be? What's your name? What's your name? Marcia Chamberlain, C H A M B E R L A I N, and the first name is Marcia. Uh huh. M A R C I A. I do see a number here, but it's just for support. Okay, yeah, I'm just going to get you over to the correct person. That's all. Yeah. Thank you. There you have. Okay. Can't figure it out. I think the answer is easy, and I'm making it hard. Hold on one second. Okay.
