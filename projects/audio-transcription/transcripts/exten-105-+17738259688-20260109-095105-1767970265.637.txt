This is Rick. Okay, Rick, my name's Alex. I'm getting a call from Honeycomb. How are you doing? I'm pretty good, Alex. Hope you're all right. Hey, pretty good. I'm pretty good. Hey, I really just wanted to take some time to introduce myself. I'm going to be your new deal champ. I'm taking over for Can. I'm not sure how much experience you had dealing with him, but he's been promoted. So I'll be your rep going forward on Justin's team. I got you, man. Well, I appreciate you calling, introducing yourself. You know, do me a favor, just drop me an email with your contact information. Would be good to have, and I'll add it to my to my system. Awesome, yeah, I'll shoot you an email right now. And of course, if you guys need anything at all, just don't hesitate to reach out. I'd be happy to help you in any way. Yeah, I appreciate it, man. We we I wish we were a bigger agent. We see we're trying, but you know it's a it's a specialty kind of niche. You know we're we don't have a ton of ton of stuff cooking, but it gets a little hotter every day. So you'll see some stuff on us. I feel pretty sure a little more frequently moving forward hopefully. Awesome, awesome, man. Well, that sounds like a plan. Hey, while I got here, I saw one for when we release here for the glade at West End. Yeah, do you guys need anything on that? Does that look good or? I think it's as good as it's going to get. It does look good. I think one of the what I'm sort of dealing with right now is that y'all's wind and hail deductible is what it is and it's not bad. It's not even that much higher than what Travelers has on it now. Y'all's prices are a lot better. That's just one of the terms that Insure doesn't quite like is that two and a half percent wind. You know when Travelers has got it at one and and other issue I think I'm having with that one. I don't think you can solve this either. Quite frankly, is the DNO liability limits. I think the max that your program offers is a million on that endorsement. And you know Travelers will let them have two million. So it's just those kind of things. You know I think they might be willing to pay a little more premium and have a little more coverage if that makes sense. Yeah, no, no, absolutely, yeah, totally makes sense. Gotcha, yeah, it's one of those things we've been trying to work on our endorsements in general. It's something that like you know it's part of our like reinsurance what we can and can offer. So when we go to renegotiate those things, we we try to we try to increase everything we can. There are some some gaps for us, like that being one of them, but our bigger ones crime actually. Yeah, but yeah, agree in order to crime. Yeah, I think yeah, and it is that's a we talked about that a little bit with this Insure. They weren't too concerned about crime. You know we you know even though we all know they need need to some of it. It's just hard to get the right form with these accounts, right? And they're trying to cover the board and and that's a that's a that's that's I mean Travelers form doesn't even do that frankly on the crime. So anyway, just just some feedback for your team. I think the DNO limit would be if I was going to ask for one one miracle, it might just be that you guys could be let that right at the same occurrence limit or whatever that GL does. That would that would be a big a big competitive improvement in my mind. Yeah, yeah, for sure. So the the one thing we are doing is so we're coming out with like an excess liability like endorsements that will become pretty soon like Q one for sure. Okay. And that will go over DNO. So you'll be able to add like if you want to add a you know a million bucks. Yeah. So you would get you would get additional million. So yeah, man, that was solved it for sure. And I think that would that would also you know make it a maybe a little easier sell on the GL side as well. You know, hey, look, you got you got three million here and two million on your DNO now with this or something. So yeah, man, that's great to hear. Hopefully, that'll be something you guys can get approved. Yeah, yeah, for sure. We're we're hopeful. Awesome man. Hey, well, it was a
