Oh. Hey Myrtle, this is Randy with the Lions Insurance. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good. Um, so I know that you had called back wondering why the um auto insurance. Thirteen dollars. Um, that was from updating your garageing address, um, because it depends on the certain zip code, um, and that's what had raised your thirteen dollars on your auto policy was updating that. Um, but I did look into the renter's policy as well, and of course you would get a discount on the auto once you get that. Um, it would currently right now only drop that thirteen dollars to ten dollars, um for updating the address. But the renter's policy, if it was paid in full, it would be one hundred and twenty-six dollars for the year for the twenty-five thousand dollars in coverage. To cover your belongings, and then of course the five hundred thousand liability to protect you if anybody was to sue you or if you were held liable for any damages. Okay, and that comes into effect when when I renew my policy. If you want to wait to renew your policy, um, then we would add the discount to the auto policy then. But yes, we can wait. We can put that in fact in February whenever your auto policy comes up for renewal. That would actually be February twenty fourth. Okay, let's do that. Okay. Until my address made it go up. Yes, the change of address did. Okay, but okay, sounds good. All right. I don't want to add that renter's until you renew my policy. Okay, no problem. Um. Let's see. So what I'll do is I'll send you um the quote for the renter's policy that way you can look it over um you know before we do anything with it and then if you have any questions just let me know. Okay. All right. Well, I hope you have a wonderful weekend. You as well. Thank you. Bye.
