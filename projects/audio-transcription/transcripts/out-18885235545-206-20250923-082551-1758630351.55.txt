Marisa Stratz. Hey good morning. I'm sorry I didn't get your name. What's your name? This is Marisa. Hey Marisa, is that right? Yeah. Hey Jeff Edmonds with Alliance Insurance in North Carolina. How are you today? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. I had left a voicemail for Eric Pearsall and sent an email regarding an account that is currently in force with you guys that is coming up on expiration. Had some change in occupancy and wanted to see what kind of options we might have. Do you need policy name? Yeah, why don't you give me the policy number and I'm going to bring you over to a renewal underwriter because if it's coming up for expiration, the renewal underwriter would be the best person to get in touch with. So if you want to start with the policy number, then I can get you over there. Let me give you that MCP zero two five G one one Q nine. An MCP is that the renewal quote number that they gave you? I think. Isn't that the policy number? No, the policy. Yeah. Hang on, let me get you a policy number. I'm sorry. C is in cap, P is in. Paul one eight eight three six three zero. Okay. Sorry. That's our story was. We had a change of exposure midterm here that I guess Eric wasn't crazy about staying on this and was going to cancel. However, the expiration is coming up in October and the exposure that changed midterm. Has changed again. Okay. I just need to see what our options are. Yeah, no worries. I'm going to get you into one of the renewal underwriters. If you get a voicemail and you hit the seven key, another team member will pick up and we could they could take it further for you because other ones are going to review it and decide if if it's something we could do or not. Okay. All right. I'm sorry. Your first name again is Jeff. Jeff. All right. Yeah. Give me one sec, Jeff. Thanks for your help. Appreciate. Yeah, no worries. USLI. This is Dr. Seabold on the Commercial Regional Renewal Team. Today is Friday, September 19th, and I've been. One moment, please. Hi, this is Teresa. How can I help you? Hey Teresa, good morning. Jeff Edmonds with Alliance Insurance in North Carolina. How are you this morning? Good. How are you? I'm doing fine. Thank you. I'm calling to talk about policy number C P as in Paul one eight eight three six three zero. Mayberry Junction. That is correct. Yep. How can I help you? A little history on this around the middle of this six month term. We sent an email that was received by Eric Pearsall about the insured having a tenant come in. It was going to be a metal manufacturer, carport manufacturer, and we requested some information on updating the exposure. Apparently, Eric was not crazy about the occupancy and said that with that exposure going on in the building that USLI would need to cancel. I wasn't sure if he was meaning cancel prior to the 1029 expiration or if he had set it to cancel before then. I never really saw any more documentation from him on that. So that's part of this. The next part of this is the tenant is. Basically, ceasing operations in our insured building and will no longer be occupying it. Why is that? The change. I'm sorry. Why is that? It wasn't convenient for them. They had an issue with having their materials picked up. It was just nothing happened. It just wasn't a good space for them. I'm sorry. Say it again. It just wasn't a good space for them. Exactly. Yep, it wasn't working out for them. There was no claims. There was no issue. And our insured is has worked out an agreement with them to let them out of their lease early. So the change in exposure that was mentioned midterm is changing back. So we're interested in two things. Number one is this policy good currently through the expiration date of 1029. And secondly, can we get a renewal offer or renewal quote with the building being vacant as it was. Previously.
