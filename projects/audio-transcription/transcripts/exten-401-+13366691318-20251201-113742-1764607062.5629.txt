Hello, this is Heather. Hey Heather, it's Bill McNair. How are you? Oh good, how's it going, Bill? Not too bad. Thanksgiving pretty good for you. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Just it's always busy, you know it goes by so fast. Just like Christmas, it'll be here and gone. And then it'll be it'll be the beginning of the year and then the first quarter will be halfway over. I know I live my life in quarters. Oh no, it's crazy. I wanted to follow up on our phone call last week prior to Thanksgiving and see what inform information you all need for me so I can get a quote over to the lender here and so we can get this thing wrapped up for closing. Okay, yeah, let's see. Let's pull your kale up, hon. All right, this is for um eleven oh two South Hawthorne. Yes. Okay. Yeah, the only thing they were waiting on were you able to confirm the roof age? I don't think you were. Did you get any? No. Okay. There was nothing like that indicated on the inspection. Okay, all right. I think that was the only thing they were asking. Let me make sure. Yeah, that's all I see. Um. So normally what they go with is like, let's see, when was the home built? What year? Is it twenty five, nineteen twenty five. Okay. It's got asphalt shingles on it at the moment. Okay, okay, all right. Yeah, so let me um let me just go back with that information then. Um, just unknown, but it is shingles. Um, we'll go with that for now and then I can get you over a quote, hon. I know we talked about the auto we would do later if possibly right we're just looking for the quote for for the home purchase to get you. Uh, closed. And the closing date is it nineteenth worth figuring on. Is that still? Yeah. December nineteenth. Okay. All right, yeah. Let me um let me wrap that up for you and I'll get that sent over. I'll email that over here shortly. Okay. Okay, thank you. All right, you're welcome. Have a good one, Bill. All right, thanks you too. See you. Thanks.
