Hold on, this is Holly. I'm gonna help you. Hey Holly, good morning. Hello, good afternoon. Hello, good afternoon. It's Robert Lumbres. I was calling to check when the premiums were due for two of our rental policies over there. Okay. Which one is it? 106 Ravenwood Court and other ones 357 Ridgecrest, and they're both in King. Okay, thank you. Do you have policy numbers for guys Robert? I don't. I don't have it on top. I'm driving on my head right now. Okay, fine. And you guys should still have our the house at Capella Ridge Road in King as well. You kind of see if we got an access policy for either of those. It looks like the Ravenwood the one I'm looking at the Ravenwood Court. Canceled. Oh. 12325 so it's almost been canceled a year. And then the Ridgecrest, it was non renewed in February. Oh, oh, and that's Capella Ridge Road. Let me see if I can find that one. Got a remodel road. That one's on AutoGraph, but Capella Ridge Road is under my bed. Oh, okay. What's that mean? Emetrio Lumbres, same last name Lumbres. L U M E T R I O, first name Emetrio E M E T R I O. Thank you. I better shop them around. I can get with Corbin to see if we have an option for either of those if you want me to. Yeah, please. I can't. Yeah, because we always have our problem with the one on Ridgecrest with all of their stuff. There, the house is livable and I'm actually getting a new tenant on it. And you know I'm always just gonna put all of that on AutoGraph. I'll check with him to double check that I'm not missing anything and if we have an option for those. Uh huh. Okay, yeah, 12 King Capella Ridge Road. Yeah, Capella Ridge Road that should still be active with you guys. Yes, that one is active. Yes. One, how much is that one for and when's the renewal? Renewal on that one is in April, April the 12. Current premium on it is 689. 689 that's good. Can you shop around for the other two? We need those to insure again. Yeah, we'll look and see if we got any options and I'll probably have Corbin reach out to you. Okay. Yeah, please. Are you on vacation? No, he's here. Okay. Yeah, I can't believe the the others just we got too many houses on our plate right now. I know it all it all gets mixed up and jumbled up and. Yeah, we'll see what we can do on those two, and I'll have him get back with you. Yeah, shop it for me because I'm getting a new tenant for one of them and I just I'm finishing up redoing one of them right now. Okay, all right, sounds good. Thank you. Thank you. Nice.
