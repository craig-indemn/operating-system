Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hey, this is Sherry Sandy. I apologize, I don't know who called me, but we're dealing with, we purchased a new vehicle and traded in our old vehicle. So, it was a gentleman. Is there a Gary? Yes, there is. Okay, that's it. Sorry. Okay, no, you're fine. Give me one moment, and I'll see if I can get it for you. Okay, thank you. You're welcome.
