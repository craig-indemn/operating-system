Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Yes, my name is Charlie Flannery. I am an insurance inspector with Mutual Inspection Bureau. I'm trying to reach a client of yours for a home owner's inspection today, and the number I have. I ended up talking to the people there at Rowan Maintenance. I was just wondering if I had the right number. This is going to be for Stephen Allen Killes Jr. Stephen Allen. Let me see. Killes Jr. And that's on 525 Tresler Road, Salisbury. Yes. Okay, so the phone number we have for him is the 704. 213. 5989. Alrighty, and we don't have any other number than that. Let me double check. Because I called that number and it went straight to the Rowan Maintenance and he said he didn't. Didn't know anybody of that name. There's a 336. 607. 4323. 4323. Yeah. Alrighty. Well, I will try that number. See if I can get a hold of him, and if not, I'll see if I can't just sweep by the location there and get the inspection done either way. Okay, sounds good. Alright, thank you so much. You're welcome. Have a good one. You too. Bye bye. Thank you. Bye.
