This is Jessica. Hey Jessica, John here with Try Prime. How are you, Sunshine? Good, how are you? I'm doing good. I just wanted to get back with you on this. See what's going on with the the insurance and all that. So I emailed the auditor Bill and I was like, "Hey Bill, um, which I know what he was going to say already. I was like, Hey, did this audit get completed? " He's like, "No. " I'm like, "Well, it's showing it's done online. " I'm a little confused. So then I reached out to the underwriter, so I'm waiting to hear back from them because technically they need to advise like where did they get those number from because they do have numbers generated as if you did the audit. Now I will say that if and I wouldn't know right until you would have to give me these numbers but if the numbers that are on the audit on the one that supposedly was completed if those are lower than the ones you actually had it probably wouldn't be beneficial to complete the audit now because you would get a bigger bill does that make sense? Yeah, so. But if numbers are lower, then obviously it will make sense for a dispute. You have the numbers that they plugged in there. Um, I can pull it up. Did you just email it to me, Jessica? Yeah. Okay, I'll just look out for the email. Um, so uh, see what else I have for you. So the the bill that came through the recent bills like 2000 and some change. I guess that was what they came up with for the deficiency or whatever for the audit period or something. Let me do the math. But yeah, it was 1, 898 from the audit and then your monthly amount of 32558. Yeah, that's about equal 2, 223. All right, cool. Well, so we're still covered. We got insurance all that. Yep, you're all good there. All right, good deal. All right, thank you, Jessica. Well, um, I'm probably I'm just going to be fine with that of 2000 dollars to save any time. Yeah, oh well, I have the numbers up right now. I'll put you a million to you, but I have a 715, 000 almost 716, 000 of a contractor sub payroll. Subdual payroll and then under carpentry, it has the owner payroll listed. Which how much is that these days? I want to say it's like 30, 000 for the owner, and then the rest goes um to like 12, 000 if if maybe there was a sub that didn't have insurance that would fall under there. Okay, all right. Well, uh, close enough to me. I'm fine to just let it ride. Okay, that's good. Well, that's done. Well, off my way. Thank you, Jessica. Appreciate it. Hey, how did um I've been thinking about it. How did the workers' comp audit go? Did you get them to speak up? I I don't know where it's at actually. I I went on a trip my son for his birthday and I had emailed her all the stuff like you said and. Um, I need to give her a call. She uh said she was going to the um she was going to put it up to I guess the dispute channels or whatever. And I haven't heard back yet, but uh, she's just not got on top of them. So I'm actually going to give her a call now. Okay, fine. Not what you know how it goes. I really do appreciate the advice. I went like you know so um I will let you know the outcome on that for sure. Of course, and hey, if you ever have any subs or anyone you know, contractor space, restaurant landlords, things of that nature that may need a new agent, let them know and send them my way. I definitely will. You are a very good agent, so I do have some subs that are looking for insurance. Okay, nice. So I will get them with you. Get them in touch with you directly. Okay. Okay, thanks, John. All right. Have a good day, Jessica. Thank you.
