Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hey, this is Bradley Davis. How are you doing? I'm good, and you? I'm doing good. I had a quick question about my auto insurance policy. Okay. Are you wanting to make a payment on it? No, no, I've I've uh, I've got a one of those letters from the liability North Carolina liability insurance, and it's kind of wild. It's it's saying that North Carolina Farm Bureau, has informed them that my policy, ended on six four of this year, June fourth, twenty five, but I've never had. This vehicle insured with them. It's always been insured with you guys, so that's kind of wild. Yes, so let me get you over to an agency if they can help you with it. Just one moment.
