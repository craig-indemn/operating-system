Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hey, this is Randy Howard. I'm with Mutual Reports. I had an appoint had an appointment at 3:15 to meet somebody out here at their property to do a homeowner's insurance inspection. This unfortunately this number came back to the policyholder, but I guess it's not the policyholder, huh? No, it's not. What's the? Do you have a policy number for the for them? Oh, probably. Let's see. Give me a second. Okay. Five seven two seven nine eight two. Okay, let's see. Is it for Axel? Yeah. I don't know how to say that. I don't either. Okay. Let's see what number I've got for them. Okay, so this shows the phone number I have for them is three three six. Seven eight two zero four seven six. Yeah, I have that one too. I don't know why this one shows. It actually says policyholder Axel Bernal Poland. Yeah. Um. In the last call, they left a message with the policyholder. I don't think so. Must not have. No, the agency, but that's the only other number we have. I was looking to make sure we didn't have any other numbers, but that looks like that's the only other one I have. Okay, well I'll try that one and see if they forgot or or whatever. Okay. All righty. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye.
