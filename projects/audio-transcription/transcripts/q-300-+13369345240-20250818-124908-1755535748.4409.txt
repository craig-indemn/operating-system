Thank you for holding. This is Holly. How can I help you? Hi, Holly. This is Brian Sims calling. I have a question about my home policy. Warning: If they cover self storage units, do you think you'd be able to help me look into that? Yeah, I can. What's your address? Two one six five Benwick Drive, Pough Town. Sure, thank you. That's with Northwest Farmers, right? Yes. A self storage unit, right? Yes. And then, if so, they are looking for a certificate to be able to waive their own insurance. Let me get with Northwest Farmers and ask because I'm not seeing it you know listed on the policy obviously but I have seen that before that there's an endorsement or it's written in the policy language where it could be covered so let me get with Northwest Farmers and see if that's something they have included. Okay. And I can let you know. Okay, I appreciate that. This is the best phone number for you. Actually, it's not. Can you give? Oh, yeah, yeah, three three six nine three four five two four zero. Okay, I will call them now and get right back with you. All right, thank you, Holly. Bye bye.
