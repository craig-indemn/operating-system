Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Yeah, I was calling for Tracy. Tracy. I mean, I mean, Jamie. I'm sorry. Jamie. Okay, don't worry. Let me see if he's available. Give me one second. So it does look like he's on another call at the moment. Are you? Um, only wanting to speak to him, or can I get you someone else? Well, I sent Chase an email and then he put me on to Jamie. So I guess anybody would work as far as I'm concerned. Okay. Um and then what is it regarding that way I kind of know who to send it to. Yeah, well, I have a car that was total loss and so I turned in the tag yesterday. So need to cancel insurance on that and then I bought a car and I need to add that. So cancel and add. Okay, all right. Well, let me get you an agent that can help. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome.
