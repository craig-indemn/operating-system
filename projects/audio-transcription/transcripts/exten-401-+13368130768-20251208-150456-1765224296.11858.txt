Thank you for holding, Missus Heather. Yes, you returned my caller earlier today about a call I made. I think it was like last week about wanting to quote homeowners insurance. Okay. Uh huh. Yes. Who are you currently insured with? I well, it's in my wife's name. I think it's with Farm Bureau, I believe. Okay. But I told her I'd just call and get some quotes on other places. I think they're kind of high, and I think I just wanted to get quotes. Okay. We can look at it. I was thinking of doing like I mean I know it's probably better if I just did home and auto. That's right. Yeah. So. Okay. I don't know what all information y'all need. Well, let me get your general information to start with. So both home and auto are with Farm Bureau. Yes. Okay. Have you filed any claims within the last three to five years on either policy? Yeah. Okay. So what is your first name? Edward. All right. What's your middle initial? P. P is in Paul.

Okay. What's her date of birth? It is June twenty eight, nineteen eighty four. June twenty eight eighty four. Yes. Okay. I don't know her license number off hand. Okay. That's going to be one of the questions. Yeah, that's right. Most people don't don't do, but they surprise me. But. All right. Yeah, we can get that. We can get all that later. As you said, you don't know when your policy is renewed. No, I don't. I quoted out like a couple weeks out. All right. I am going to do two twelve twenty. Okay. And do I have any other policies besides home and auto? We have a life insurance policy there, but if we switch, I'll probably just do away with it. Okay. No, we do write life insurances. We write we we actually write all lines of business. So if you need anything, would it I don't know if it would say it was helpful for us to get her policy there because she has a. Bipolar and a lot of insurance companies that are life insurance policies that want to buy or want to buy. Right. But I actually have. I was able to get one on her through my work. Oh, okay. So that's I don't know. I mean, if we change the life insurance policy over, I'd be great. But it doesn't. It's not really a concern for you right now. The home and auto is. Yeah. So what? So you so Farm Bureau, they have home, auto, and a life insurance policy. Is that right? Yes. Okay. All right. But like like you know like you said the home and auto is the private. Okay. Now do y'all have children that are driving? Who who was on your policy as far as drivers? It's just me and her. Her son was on our policy, but he's in the military now and he's not driving, so we we had him taken off. Okay. All right. See. All right. Let me see something here. We actually quoted you. I actually did last year around. Oh really. I might have. Because I was adding it to our system, it's like it's a duplicate. It looks like a duplicate. I am like, wait a minute. Let me see if we got your policies. I might have been trying to quote it then to try to switch again. I don't I can't remember. Yeah, I quoted your home and auto, March the tenth of twenty twenty four. Was your email? Was it mechanic? Yeah, my email
