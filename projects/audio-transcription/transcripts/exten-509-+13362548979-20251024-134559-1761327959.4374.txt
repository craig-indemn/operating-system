Good afternoon, excuse me, Alliance Insurance. Hey Dina, this is Wallace. I called you back. Sorry, Mister. Sorry, Mister Call. Did you get my message? Yeah, yeah, I just played it, and if you could, if you could sign us back up for that, it'd be great. Okay. So you do want to be on the paperless deal? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, so I can't, I can't go on there and sign up for it. That's one of those things that you have to log in. And I can tell you where to go once you do log in if you want to try to do it on the phone. Okay, I'm not that computer savvy, so let me let me pull up Progressive dot com. Is that it? Yeah, have you logged in there before? I doubt it. Okay, so you you'll have. So I got I got I got to deal that password and crap. Yes. Yeah, if you don't want to do that, Wallace, what I can do is I can call Progressive, and they can waive I think three dollars of that that you would have to pay a dollar and then you would be done with. If you don't care whether you're on the paperless or not, it's up to you. If you don't pay the dollar, what happened is it it will be the same thing that that you ran into this year. It's because the paperless discount you lost it on the past term. So there was a balance I guess left on the past term, and then when this term got paid, it paid that portion of the last term. You know what I'm saying? Like it keeps going back and then you still have a dollar due, or you know. But but but the bill that I got from Progressive was was for 1400 and some odd change. It it wasn't it wasn't for four dollars or three dollars. Yeah. I didn't see it either until when I was getting ready to log out. I just happened to go back to the past term. You know sometimes you go back to the past term and you you know you check just to be sure and that's what I did and then that's when I saw you know. The four dollars, so then I called them and then you know that's what she told me because I really wasn't for sure what what the four dollars for. Yeah. But it's up to you. What if you want to try to go on there and set it up on the paperless? We can get get rid of that altogether, or if you want to just pay the one dollar and be done with it, I can get the three dollars waived. Yeah. It's up to you. Come on, it's only three dollars. What am I supposed to do? Mail them a check for three dollars. No, if you want, because I and I I would have to call them and request for them to waive the three dollars and then if you wanted to give me your credit card information I could apply the payment for you. It's up to you. I don't mind doing it. Yeah, let's let's do that. Okay. Yeah, we'll do that. So you you want you want my credit card information for the dollar? Oh, sorry. No, sorry. Okay, you ready? Yes. Okay, Visa four four zero zero six six five one two four one two seven four seven one. Okay, and the expiration. Eleven twenty eight. All right, and the three digit code. One nine one. All right, so let me read it back to you. So have four four zero zero six six five one two four one two seven four seven one. Correct. Expiration is eleven twenty eight and the code is one nine one. Correct. Wallace, it's the card in your name. Yes. Okay, all right. It's it's it's it's W. Stanfield Lane is is the way it's written on my card because I don't I don't go by Wallace. My full name is Wallace Stanfield Lane. I got a W Stanfield Lane on the card. If that if that makes a difference. Okay, I don't think it does, but that that's good to know. Okay. Um. Very good. So what I can do? I'm going to call them, and then I'll see if they can forward that receipt over to you. If not, I'll see if they can forward it to me and then I can forward it over to you. But if I have any problems, I'll definitely call you back. Okay. You you got my email correct. Um. Is it the V O R T E? Yeah. Okay. That's it. Okay. All right. Well, I try to get this taken care of for you. Okay. I appreciate it. All right, you take care
