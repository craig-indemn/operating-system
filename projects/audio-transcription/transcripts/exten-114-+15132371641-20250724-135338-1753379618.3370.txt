Thank you for holding this. Is JC? How may I help you? Hi, JC. This is Tim White calling. How are you today? I'm doing well. How are you, Tim? Good. Thanks. Hey, I was wondering. Did you receive that copy of the receipt for my plates? Let me take a look at the system. Give me one second. Okay. Did you send it from the six one four one phone number? Yeah, one one six four one. One six four one. Okay. All right. Sorry about that. Yes, I've got it now. Okay. Process that. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. I've got a question. My wife and I just drove a Tesla today. We're thinking of leasing one. I was wondering if you could get me a quote for insurance on that. I guess the same place Progressive. Okay, and do you happen to have that VIN number handy? Well, I have a VIN number. What we're going to do is order it, but they they give me a VIN number for a vehicle that's very similar. Is that good enough or? I can give you an estimate on it. Yeah, yeah, that's all I need. We can go from there. Yeah, it won't be depending on the time frame. When you're going to decide to actually lease it and then time frame and then of course the model. If it's the the exact same, then it'll look similar. But we don't want to guarantee that that's going to be the exact price. Right. Yeah, I understand that. I'm going to get an idea. Okay. Yeah. Then of course I can help you out with that. And I'm ready for the VIN number whenever you're ready. As soon as I find it again. Okay. Yeah. No worries. Just let me know when you got it. Okay. Ready. It's seven. S is in Sam. A is in Albert. Y is in Yankee. G is in Golf. D is in Delta. E is in Echo. D is in Delta. Nine T is in Tango. A is in Alpha. Four one zero one three nine. Thank you. And then it's a rear wheel drive model by 2026. 2026. Okay. Yeah, that's what I've got. All right. Let me log that in the system one second. Oh, you can do it right away. Huh. Okay. Yeah. Let me see if I can pull it up here. In the estimate, I guess we take into account that we have our homeowner's and the other car. Or would that be something that we would be figured out later on? Hold on. Give me one second. I'm sorry. I'm trying to log into the system. I'm sorry. I'm in. All right. I'm sorry. You said you were you were saying something about the. Your home. Yeah, I was just curious whether the estimate that you're going to give me would would take into account that we have our homeowner's insurance and our other car with Progressive. Um. Let me see. Now, do you have those at different agencies or here with us? Because I only. I think they're all there. Yeah. I'm sorry. I thought they were all there with you, but maybe not. Okay. Let me see. I know if I get on my Progressive account, it shows all of it, but that doesn't mean they're in the same agency. I guess now that you mentioned it. Yeah, I've got. I can see the auto, but I don't see the other ones. And if we don't have access to them, then it won't reflect on our end. Okay. How would I get something like that changed? I wonder. You would have to wait until the renewal, and then you would reach out to us if you wanted to move your. Your home here with us, and it would be before the renewal. You would reach out to us, and then we'd sign a document to have your policy moved over to us. Okay, but but the Progressive would know that we have two other policies, right? Yes. Okay. Yes, all it is is us having access to it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so you just call one place to manage your policies. Right. Yeah, that makes it a lot simpler. Yeah, it does. All right. So I'm going to put that information that you gave me in the system and see what it. Or rating gives us. Okay. And now what is going to be the use of the vehicle? Are you going to be using it to commute to work or just pleasure use? Oh, just pleasure. My wife and I both retired. Okay. And I'm quoting it with that five hundred dollar deductible that you currently have on the other vehicle. Okay. Okay, so this price is only
