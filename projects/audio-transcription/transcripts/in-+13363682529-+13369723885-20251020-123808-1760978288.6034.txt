Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Yes, man. Y'all do the Medicare and Advantage plans and stuff like that. It's also. We do. Are you looking for a quote? Yeah. Okay, I don't have an agent available at the moment. I can get one to call you back if that's okay. Sure. Okay. Let's see. Can I get your name? Maybe I can maybe I can look up my existing plans, see what we got, and just see what y'all can come up with or. Or you know or whatever, we'll just look around. But anyhow, my name is William Efler E F F L E R. I actually go by Lawrence. That's my middle name. Okay, and you said how you are laughing. You said the E F F L E R. Yep. Okay, and what's a good phone number? Three three six nine seven two three eight eight five. Okay, so I'll give it to Steve. His name is Steve Edmonds. So I'll get him to call you back. And then he can set up an appointment. Okay, because y'all, y'all do different company plans and stuff like that. Sort of go by what's best to suit our needs. Is that correct? Yes, that that is correct. Okay. Yes, and then he can go over all that. He can answer all those questions. Well, I might want to get another quote this year. I've been working with this company for a few years, which they've done good, but they're getting really. Very slow on responding, so that gets under my skin sometimes. But anyhow, okay, just have Steve call me and we'll just thank you for that. Okay, well I will do it. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good day. You too. Bye bye. Thank you. Bye.
