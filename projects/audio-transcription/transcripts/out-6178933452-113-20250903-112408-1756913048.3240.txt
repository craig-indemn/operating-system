What is it, Phil? Hey, Phil, this is Gary at Alliance Insurance. Hey, how's it going, man? It's going good. I wanted to call. We're trying to get some re quotes for you guys because you you did receive a letter that MSA is not going to renew that policy. Yeah. Um, I need to find out when's the last time that you put a roof on the house. I haven't done it since I bought it in 2016. I have to think about how old it is. I probably could go back and find it from when we bought it, but I don't know if it's got in my head. Just want to get some updates on this, so we can find the best quote that we can to get you going here. Um. Now, has anything changed in your household? You have any you have any animals? No, animals, swimming pools, trampolines, anything like that at the house. No, we have a we have a cat, but that that shouldn't have changed from when we had one. Okay. And then what about any other updates that you've done at your house? As far as electric plumbing, anything like that? No, nothing like that. Okay. We had a new AC unit put in, but it's the exact same as the AC unit we had before. Right. Okay. When did you have that put in? Just the other day, like last month. So it is it is new. The AC is. Yeah, we have a new AC unit on the first floor. Okay, yeah, but we always have had it. It's the exact same configuration as what we had before. Okay, new unit. Have any security systems or anything like that at the house? We have an ADT security system. Okay. Oh yeah, we use it pretty religiously. I'm going to go through these quotes and try to get some numbers together for you. Um. Sure. And I will be back in touch with you if it's okay no later than tomorrow. Great. We love that. And then come up with something. Oh yeah, let me know what let me know what other information you might need that could help with any of the quotes, and I'll see if I can find out when that roof was put on. Very good. Thank you so much, and I will be in touch with you. Okay. Appreciate it, sir. Take it easy. Thank you. Uh, I know.
