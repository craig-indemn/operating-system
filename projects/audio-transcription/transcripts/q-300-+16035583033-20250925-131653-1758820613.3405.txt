It's a great afternoon, Lawrence Insurance. This is Jamie. Hi, I have a question about my policy. Yeah, I can. Hopefully, help you. My phone system pulled me into Daniel Gricker. Is that what's sticking with? Hi there, Daniel. Hi. I've got you at nine five five C Shell Court, Apartment Two Hundred One in Royal Hall. That's right. And I've got an auto policy with Progressive. Give me one second. Let me get this thing open. Okay. And while it's loading, go ahead, Firewood. How can I help you? So my policy was, I was paying about two hundred dollars roughly every month, and now it's four hundred and fifty. And I wanted to know why that was. That's a good question. A very good question. Okay, I do see. All right, so just reviewing what I've got. Policy is active. It does reflect nine five five C Shell Court in Royal Hall. I've got. You as the only driver of a twenty nineteen Hyundai Elantra. The vehicle has comp collision rental and towing. Got a thousand dollar deductible for your comp and your collision. All that still sounds up to date, right? Hope. All right, and then let's check what's going on here. Okay. So the policy renewed on July twenty eighth of twenty five. It's a six month term. It's going to run until January twenty eighth of next year. So looking at the couple things that happened here that I can see. The easiest one to explain to you is that North Carolina bumped up the base rate for insurance on July first of this year. And when they and when I say the base rate, I am talking about all auto and all homeowners policies. Got increased by North Carolina at least seven and a half percent. That happened. On July first, this policy renewed on July twenty eighth. So this new term that you are in right now picked up that new rate increase. That affected some of the money. Okay, that's every auto policy in the state wouldn't make a difference if it was State Farm or Geico or Progressive or whoever. They all got adjusted. So that happened. The other thing that this renewal picked up, which is harder to explain because I can't. See what type of in like percentage increase it picked up, but. On March twenty first of twenty twenty five, it shows a major at fault accident. In your information and they've assigned three points to that. When I click back into the previous term, that doesn't show up. So easiest way I could explain that to you is that when this thing renewed on July twenty eighth, the system went out looking for your information. It found that accident. They assigned three points to the insurance policy, and those points caused an up rate in the premium. So between the rate increase in the state and then the accident that happened, it has bumped his money up. Good side, bad side. You had this accident on March twenty first, and North Carolina didn't change the auto laws until July first of this year. Which means that in three years' time, this accident and all this information is going to fall off your information. And then Daniel will come back down to having a neutral rating in the eyes of the insurance carriers. Now I point that I point that out to you because North Carolina changed a lot of stuff with auto laws this year. One of the things they changed Daniel on effective July first is that they opened that window from three years of surcharges. To five years, so this exact same this exact same accident. If you were to have it again today, and I think knock on wood, I hope you don't hear. But you know. People who are getting an accident today who have a major at fault accident, that information is going to stick on the insurance policy for five years. So it's going to hurt even longer now. None of that is woman fuzzy. All of it stinks. I firmly grasp that. The tough part about it is that the insurance industry itself, and I am talking all the carriers in all the states. It's not as healthy as it has been historically. Between the inflation that's going on that mean you live in and high value losses, the insurance carriers are essentially eating more money. When the claims pay, and so the future forecasting shows unfortunately Daniel higher rates because all that is money that comes out of the PD bank that they eventually kind of put back. So. Looking at options for you, I don't have another carrier. Let me just see. Yeah, this is Monoline Auto. This is the only thing I've ever seen. So I don't have another carrier that would be Progressive off this pricing. And your deductible is already maxed out at a thousand dollars each. What you could do have a bank loan on the vehicle. Let me check and see. Yeah, I mean, okay. So I don't want to talk you into this
