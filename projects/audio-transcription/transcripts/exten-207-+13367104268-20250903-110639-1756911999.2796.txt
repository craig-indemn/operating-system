Sorry for holding. This is Cody to help you. Hey Cody, it's Jennifer. Hey, how are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing pretty good. Good. Hey, um, it's that guy from FG Insulation. He wants to hold on on it. He said because he needs to purchase his truck. I thought he had already purchased it, but he hasn't purchased it. He's going to go purchase it sometime next week. Okay. So he said he wants to get that done first before. Before he starts. Yeah. Um. Let me just. But the total might could change, or I don't. I don't know if it could change, but I feel like it could change. That's what I was going to pull up here. Give me a second. I just want to see how long these quotes are good for. Not sure if it tells me on here though. I'm just trying to see because we did these. It's been. Few weeks now. Yeah, it's been like two weeks. I think he's going to be fine. Okay. And then did you get my email for adding those two trucks for Oscar? I did. Yeah, I emailed you back on that. I saw went into auto owners to add them, and neither one of those VIN numbers are pulling those trucks. Now they're brand new 2025s, right? So. Yeah. Sometimes brand new VINS won't pull correctly. So I don't know. Um. Yeah, those those quotes are fine. If he waits till next week or whatever for FG. Um. So can you just verify? So that was like from the dealership. Those. Yeah, that's what the dealer. That's what the dealership gave us. I don't have a registration. I don't know if Oscar already has one. Um. Yeah, because I put in both of those VINS and neither one of them would pull. So they're 2025s. What are they? F350s. Oh yeah. Okay. What you know the sub model of them? Do you have like do you have that more documentation like whatever is in the folders? Can you send me more information on the trucks? Yeah, I just want to. You broke up on me a little bit. What'd you say? Oh, I'm going to call Oscar and get that for you. Yeah, just send me if you can send me like the I don't know the bill of sale or whatever it is that actually lists like the full information on the vehicle since the VINS aren't pulling sometimes that just happens on brand new vehicles so. That way, whenever I just have to submit the request to the company directly instead of just adding them myself, and then they're going to want obviously know the sub model. You know it's an F350, but you know there's. Five different sub models like levels, trim levels, and stuff. Um. Okay. Yeah. So yeah, if you can just send me like the actual paperwork on each of the vehicles, that way I can submit those with the request to add those. Okay. And you need them added effective the day you send that on the 30th. Well, Oscar has sent them to the wrong insurance. He sent them to the one we had before. Oh okay. And she didn't respond back until that day and said, "Hey, we don't have a policy for those." Yeah. Yeah. Um. So just I mean I can add that's the day you requested so that was the day I was going to request that they be added because I assumed that was the day that he took. Ownership of them. Yeah, because because the guys are working and we didn't know until literally that day. So we need them affected. Did he get them before the 30th? He got them the 27th. I believe. Okay, so that's the day that we technically need to add them to the policy. Um. Just shoot me an email with those bill of sales or whatever it is that is in the folders that just lists all the information on each of the trucks and then that way I can send that in with. The um. With the request to add those on the 27th. Okay. I'll do that. And then I can once. What I'll have to wait until they actually that actually gets processed, but they'll probably. Before I could like send you an ID card or anything like that, so. You'll probably receive something in the mail about as soon as I can send you something too. To be honest. Okay. Okay. Yep, just send me that whenever you can. Excuse me, and then just let me know in FG. I guess whenever they get their truck and they're ready to get those started, and we'll we'll get that taken care of. Okay
