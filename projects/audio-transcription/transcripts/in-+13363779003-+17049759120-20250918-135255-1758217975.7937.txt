Again. Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Tell me, I hope you. Hello. How are you? I'm good. How about you? I am well. Quick question. I haven't talked to y'all in some time, and I have an old phone number. So I want to verify. Do you are y'all handling auto insurance? Auto owners insurance. Yes, we are. Terrific. All right. Well, my name is Michael Terry, and I need a little bit of information. I wonder if you could put somebody on the phone to help me, or would you be glad to help me? What's the situation you're looking in? I need. I might be. Okay. Good. What I'm looking for is what my homeowners insurance is scheduled to be for the 2025-26. I think y'all renew it in like November, so I guess it would be 26. Okay. So I am seeing that there are no active policies at the moment. Are you looking to reopen? A policy. Well, I thought I thought that y'all were handling our insurance on my home. Because it has you listed as being paid by my mortgage company. In November of 2024, I didn't know that I had changed. Yeah, it's not looking like we have any active policies with you at the moment, but I can definitely connect you over to an agent to see what's going on with that situation. Then who's handling our insurance? Good question. Okay. So if I transfer you over, an agent will be able to look further into this and maybe see why nothing's active on our end, or maybe see who does carry that insurance if anything did change. Okay. All right. Let me go ahead and transfer you over. Uh huh.
