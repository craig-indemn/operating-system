Thank you so much for calling my Lions Insurance. Hello, this is Ruth Mark, and I have been talking with Chase there, and he told me that he could not cover me for the next year because of the prices and of the two buildings that I have, and I was wondering if I could speak to someone about I've read through what I would be getting and I wanted to ask if I am a owner of the buildings, but I do not own anything inside the walls or the ceiling. Do I still have to pay for all of the other things that is listed? I understand completely what you mean. Give me one second. Let me try to locate them for you. Just a moment. Okay, just stay on the line with me. Thank you. Could I have? Do you have your policy number by chance? Yes, I do. May I have it, please? It's a long one. It's okay. Okay, it's two six four six fifteen dash thirty five fifty six twenty eight seventy two dash twenty six. Okay, thank you. One second, Miss Mark. We're almost done. Okay. Okay, I've got plenty of time except for you. Thank you. Thank you so much for your patience. So the policy number is three five five six two eight seven two. Okay, and that gives you the commercial and general liability on your policy. Okay. I got the policy already. You see who else could help me. The main things that I'm questioning are all of these things that is going with a building, the three buildings such as valuable papers and records and all of that. These are renters that is in that building, and am I responsible for what they have as far as their own electrical pro things or whatever. I have no other insurance with them. Yeah, I need to have the the agent review the policy to see if we can either offer a coverage or do away with with the coverage so you don't have to be able to cover that so you're not responsible for that. So but I need to help the agent. I'm still working on it. Okay, I'm trying to get Benjamin for you so he can he knows the process and he knows a policy already. Okay. Did you had a good holiday? I did very much too much eating I think that's one thing. It's hard to stop after you start. Oh my goodness, yeah. Okay, so Chase is out of the office already, so I'm going to get Anna Joyce, which is one of the commercial agents that helps Chase with the process of getting the policies updated and everything else. So. Okay, that sounds wonderful. You're welcome. Thank you, Miss Mark, for being so patient with me. No, no, no. We close at five, so we have an hour or forty-five minutes to meet. So don't worry about it. And anyways, you're the most important thing. Anyways, if if we go beyond the hour, it doesn't matter. We have to work with you to keep you happy and keep you within the company. You know because we want to. I've been with your company for a long time, but Chase said that he didn't have anything for me, but he would try to find somebody, and I have had auto owners insurance. But what I'm reading is it seems like wow I've paid right much money for something I don't really use, but we'll see what she says. Okay, thank you so much for your patience. I'm transferring you to her right now. All right.
