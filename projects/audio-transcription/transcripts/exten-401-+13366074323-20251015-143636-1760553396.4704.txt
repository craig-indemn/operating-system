Thank you, the whole. This is Heather. Hey Heather, this is Stephen Killes. Hey Stephen, how are you? Fine, I'm sorry to bother you. I know you're busy. Just want to know if there was. No, I got your voicemail and we were in a meeting this morning. Yeah, we've been in a meeting. You know it was auto owners. I said state auto, but it was actually auto owners. I know that's a good price. I I think that was a great price. I just wanted to know if there was one. They're one of our top carriers, Stephen. Yeah. Well. Do we have your home with right? Do we have your. Right. Yeah, they are like them in Cincinnati. We we write a ton of business with them. Like I said, everybody else. There there is let's see. I have. Yeah, somewhere in that same price range. Well, that was the thing. It shouldn't have to be exactly the same, but you know. Let me hold on one second. Let me see what it came back at. It was with Utica. Because that's the only other carrier that's going to do it now. If we could, who insures his vehicle? If we can bundle. No, no, no. We're not. I don't want to get into that. That's more complication. That's just too too much complication. If you can send me one from them, and there are other ones. You know that that that quote that you sent me. I have that email, but it's not attached anymore. I can't bring it up. I've looked at it before and I was going to print it out. But you talked about the one with auto owners. Yeah, I didn't. It just disappeared, and so I just want to make sure that that this one doesn't disappear. If you send me a, we'll probably go with that one. Again. You just don't you don't care for auto owners. What in the world? What happened? Well, I hate to go into it. So. That's just because we do business with them. Yeah, yeah, I know and and I may go with them, but I just wanted to see an alternate. If it's possible, sure. No, absolutely yes, absolutely. I will. I'll go back. I'm sorry to be so much trouble. You're not, you're not, you're not. I'm just shocked to hear that because I don't. Like I said, we we raise more business with them in Cincinnati than we do any other carriers. So that just surprises me a little bit. But no, I mean you know. It is what it is. If you are telling yes, auto owners, I don't you know. No problem. I got another quote. I'm going to send you. Okay. That sounds great. I just have to go. I just have to go in and revise it and make sure that it's it's correct. All right. Okay. And I'll get that sent over to you. Okay. All right. Thanks, Stephen. You're welcome. Bye bye. Hey, you see him.
