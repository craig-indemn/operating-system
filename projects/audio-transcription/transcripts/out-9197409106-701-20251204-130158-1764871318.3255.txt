Stephen, hi there, Stephen. This is just Jeremy. I'm calling from Alliance Insurance Services, sir. How are you doing, sir? Doing good. How about you are? I am. Thank you very much. Looks like you're in need of getting some insurance. I believe having your property management listed as. Yeah, I'll I'll give you the rundown of kind of what's going on. I have insurance right now. My insurance company won't put them as. Was it additional insured or something like that? I put it on that little note and I can send you some info on my lease. But I just need to make sure I can get something that actually works for these guys. Okay, your first name's it's spelled with the PHR of D. Ph. S. T. E. P. H. E. N. All right, excellent. Arnold last name. Yep. All right, and you just go by Stephen. Is that your preferred? Okay. What's your date of birth, sir? Three thirteen ninety six. All right, and let's see. Good phone number. Is it this number that I called you on the cell phone nine one nine seven four zero nine one zero six? Okay, good deal. Seven four zero nine. All right, and who has your? Oh, excuse me, sorry. You're looking down further down my list here. I've got your email address, I believe, where you would send in that case. I'm confirming it is Arnold Stephen twelve at Yahoo. Yep, that's correct. All right, excellent. And what's your driver's license number, sir? Shoot, I can get it for you. Okay, I don't need the leading zeros on it. Yeah. Let me find my wallet. No problem. All right, so without the zeros, it's three three four six six four two seven. Okay, perfect. And what is your current address, sir? Three o five West. Oh no, let me get it pulled up. I just moved here. Fourth Street. You're not the first one. Yeah. Three o five West Fourth Street and what's your unit number, friend? Look at my door. Three o five. All right, so three o five West Fourth Street Unit three o five. Salem two seven one zero one. All right, I got you there. Who handles your auto insurance currently, sir? Currently, I have both of them with Erie Insurance. I'm not sure who they use. They use some kind of sub for the apartment rental insurance, but it should be through. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, sometimes we have opportunities with bundling. Yep. Even renters. Give me that option because that's that's what I did. I had the car insurance and I put this on the rental insurance on top of it to get a discount. So let let me know if there's any deals. Um, because I'm definitely open to switching. I'm not too you know loyal to them. All right. Well, here's what I'm going to do, friend. I'm going to send you an email. This is strictly for the auto portion. This is all you need to worry about on it. Um, and in this email, there's a link. So if it goes to your junk folder, it could it could go to spam. It's coming from Jeremy at myallianceinsurance.com. May have some verbiage of canopy connect in there. Canopy is just a service that's used. To where you click on the link in the body of the email, you select Erie, you log in like you normally would to Erie. It sends me a copy of your coverages over and any VIN numbers corresponding with that. Okay. And then I'm able to run the full gambit that way. Um. So I'll just click send on that email to you, sir. And the other question I will have for you is when do you want to see this go into effect? As soon as possible. So I have a hard deadline for December 15th to get this done. Um, so hopefully we can get something done. You know by the end of next week by the latest. Oh yeah, that that won't be an issue at all. Okay, perfect. And so yeah, definitely if you'll check out that email for that portion with the auto that allows me to plug and play into some of our carriers that do the renters and auto. Bundling credits and present you with the best option. Good Lord willing the creek don't rise. I may have you something by close of business today. Truthfully. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I won't. I won't be able to get this over to you until later today. I will be in and out of meetings for the next four or five hours. So I will get that done tonight at some point. We'll go from there. That sounds great
