Hello Amy. Hey there. Okay, are you sitting down because you're not going to believe what I'm going to tell you. Oh god, what. Well, when I change the VIN number, that that was not for a 2001 Nissan that like it was showing on the policy. It's a 2000 Nissan, okay. Right. It's a totally different year model. So I call back in to request that FS one, and they want a copy of the registration card. And I have to get a signature on a statement of no losses since October 10th. Okay. And if you can do that for me, we we will be able to get this done. Now it gets better, okay. Okay. When the year model changed, it changed the premium, and you're going to get a bill for 22 dollars. Okay. I just thought this was all encompassing here. You know we didn't know we were going to open up a can of worms on everything. But oh good lord, yeah the the truck is actually a 2000. 2000 is correct. It's been on your policy as a 2001 with that VIN number, other than the changes we made, and that's been on there since the inception of this policy. So that's just that's just thank goodness that nothing happened. Um. Because it could have been a mess really. Oh wow. Um. Now is the registration is in Alex's name. Yes. Okay. Now this email I have for you a petros one two four. Does that come to you? It does. Okay, I'm going to send that form here in just a little bit to that email. It's going to be it's going to be an electronic signature. So we we need Alex's name on that thing. And send it back to me, and once I get that and the registration card, then I can call them back and and get this done. Okay, on that statement, can I sign it or does Alex have to sign it? It's going to be it's going to be to your email address, but if the registration card is in his name, he needs his name needs to be there. And that's the what that's the way it should come. Right. Okay. Either way, just just sign it. Okay. Okay. And um and we'll when when I get that back and do you want me to um. Let's see the best way for you to send the registration card to me. Hopefully because you know the he has the truck and he's in Charlotte, could he take a picture of it? He could take a picture of it and send it to me. He can. He can, but make sure it's very legible. Okay. Right. And um, I'm trying to see if we have got you guys. Now is this number that we're speaking on now the 287 number? Is that your your regular number? Yeah, that's my cell. Okay, I've got I've got Mike's number listed for you on here as well. So I'm going to go ahead and change that too. Yeah. Then I'm going to um. Send you an email that's coming from me. Uh huh. To send the registration card back to. Okay. So you're going to get two emails. You're going to get one that's an electronic signature, and then you're going to get one regular email. Unless you would rather me text text it to you. I mean, if you can, it's usually faster. That's fine. Very good. In any event, we'll get it taken care of here shortly. Okay. Okay, and you said the statement of losses. It would be better. He needs to sign it because I'll see him tomorrow. Yeah, I mean if if you can do that, I can send it to your your email and and when you see him tomorrow, just get him to sign it for me. Okay, I can do that. And we'll go from there. All right. Okay. Okay. This is crazy. I'm going to tell you it's crazy. It's crazy. I haven't dealt with something like this in a long time. So this is weird. Wow. Okay, all right. We're going to get straightened out now. There we go. Thank you so much. All right. Thanks. All right. Bye bye.
