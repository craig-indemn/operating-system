Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hey, um, called yesterday and asked for someone to call me back for a commercial request, and I'm still waiting 24 hours later. Um, okay, um, let me get you an agent that can help. Is this is this for C and C custom LLC? Yes. Okay, gotcha. Are you a commercial agent? I am not. I'm just the reception. Um, I'm trying to see who manages your account. Though, give me one second. What kind of questions did you have? I just need a certificate of insurance and worker's comp from the builders. Okay. Uh, all right, bear with me just one second.
