Right, right. Are you doing anything special? No, I'm buying a home. I'm closing on my home. My closing date is my birthday. Yeah, like happy birthday to me. Yeah, that's good. That's a good thing. It is. It is, but yeah, it's been crazy. Okay, so are you married? Oh no. You're single. All right. So it's are you the only one listed on the deed? Or do you do you have several rental properties or do you have like an LLC? This one might have been that one in Durham. It's under an LLC. It is. Yes. What's the name of your LLC? PiSoft Group LLC.

The Cadillac is for me to run around neighborhood. Tesla is for me to go to work. What year is the Cadillac? Oh, twenty fifteen. I think I want to do the the the Tesla is twenty twenty two. I think I want to do the auto right now. My focus is on is on homes. Okay, all right. Well, like I said, you know you're going to get a couple hundred shaved off if you bundle. Um, like with the auto, but I mean I still quote them. I'll do the homes, but just keep in mind. You know it's like you said currently you have your home and auto with Utica. So if you if you move the home away from Utica and leave the auto, then your auto will go up. But um, but yeah, I mean let me just start. I can this can be a starting point, and then we can all just come back and quote the auto with it. Okay, but it is better to go ahead and quote them all. But if you don't want to, you don't want to do that. That's understandable. Um. Like I said, we can once I get the quotes for you, and if we're even in the ballpark, or can save you a couple hundred, then you know we can definitely look at the auto too. All right, fair enough. Okay, yes. Um. So I am going to all these homes are fairly new. The oldest one is Longview, right? Yes. Okay. All right. So and then the you have a mortgage on all three. Yes. Okay. Freedom. That kind of money. Well, I'm sure you're getting some good revenue generating that from the rental properties, so you should be able to get that paid off before long. Um. So Freedom Mortgage insures which property? The the Longview. No, uh, Freedom is the. Mortgage company for Long for Sutherland and. And Longview. And Longview. Who insures Flat Road? Movement mortgage. That's what I confuse that. Okay. Yep. Yeah. And so now is all three S roads the the movement and freedom. Take care of the insurance and taxes. Okay. All right. Do you know when your policies renew? Ah, whoa. I think for. Ah gosh, Longview. I think it was the fourth, which was yesterday. Oh gosh. I mean, we can I can't always cancel that. You can. It's not a big deal. Yeah, yeah. And then the one in Charlotte. Uh. I can I can't remember. Okay. I know the one in. I don't know about the one in Sanford since it was sometime in August. That's when I took in the house. I'm pretty sure. Okay, all right, gotcha, gotcha. Um. So this one Longview is the primary one that you're focused on right now because it just renewed yesterday. Right. Okay. All right, and then um. There's no swimming pool. Is any pet allowed on the property? Are there any pets, dogs, trampling? Nope. Sorry, and no pool. Okay. Nope. All right. So let me get to work on this for you, and you said that is. Utica insures this one. Yes. Okay. What what did they just pay Utica? What was your new premium on your renewal? What did Freedom pay Utica on Longview? Ah, guys, to be to be honest, I don't remember the numbers. On top of my head, I know it was somewhat high. Okay. All right. Let me see what I can do for you, Gene. Um, what is your email address? W. E. S. T. I. N. One zero three six at yahoo dot com. Is that Weston like W E S T I N? Uh huh. Weston one zero three six at yahoo. Yes. Okay, and this is the best phone number to reach you back on. Is this your cell? Okay. Yes, that's my cell. All right. Um. If you I know you say you're leaving at five, I just took a break so I can make this phone call. Okay. If you don't get to finish by today, we can always resume tomorrow. Okay, perfect.
