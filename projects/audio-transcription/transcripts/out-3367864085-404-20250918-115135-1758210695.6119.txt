Hello. Hey Albert, this is Heather with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Okay. Good. I was calling in reference to your upcoming renewal, and wanted to see if you had thought any more about updating the deductible. Yes. We want to. Do that. What were we talked about three thousand. Um. It looks like we had quoted it at twenty five hundred, which I think was going to lower the total premium to like eleven sixty eight. Do it. Let me go ahead and put that change in effective the renewal date. Yeah, let's do that. Okay. All right. I'll go ahead and. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Sorry Albert, did you say something? No, uh, that's some great people. Okay. I got you. All right. Well, I'll go ahead and get this processed, Albert, and then if you do have any follow up questions, just let us know. Okay. Okay, you're going to send me another. Another bill, yes. The bill, yeah, okay. All right. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
