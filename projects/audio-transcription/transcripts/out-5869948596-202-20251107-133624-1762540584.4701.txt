Hello. Hey Karen, this is Heather. What's the lawn insurance? How are you? I'm good. How are you? Doing good. I'm sorry, I missed you earlier. So I do have a quote from National General, and it the only difference is your liability is less because they don't offer a million like progressive. But I did put the the rental on there, so you can compare. But it is not apples to apples. So I don't know if this is something that you necessarily want want to move. With the it's 500, 000 per person, 500, 000 per accident, versus the 500, 000 per person, a million per accident that you currently have. And if we this is for the year, so for the year, if you pay monthly and we have it on auto pay with routing and account number, it would be 129983 for the year, which is like roughly 114 a month. Now with what you're currently paying, we can always add rental on there and see where we're at. To compare with that, but your renewal with Progressive is 136 and that's without the rental. Right, so it it would be more with the rental then, and that's only a six month that's only a six month policy. The other one is a year policy, correct? Correct, correct. Okay, what's the deductible on the year policy? So I left them at a thousand because I was going to call and go over this if we wanted to see what it would be with a lesser deductible. Well, yeah, if it's not too much trouble to see, yeah. So the option. Go ahead. I'm sorry. No, I I'm thinking that I want to go with the the 114. Okay. Um, but I I would be interested in knowing what it what the cost is, with the 500 a lower deductible. Let's say 500 or whatever. Okay, so our what we normally quote at is 100 for comprehensive, which is going to be your glass break, hail damage, anything basically out of your control. Is we usually quote at 100 and then 500 for collision. So if we looked at that. And changed those, this is going to put you at 1455 for the year and monthly you would be at 127. Um and some change. And then if we did 500 500 just to kind of put it in perspective. It would be 12231 a month, so still less than what you're paying, but there is a difference in the liability coverage. Right. Right. So I can email this over to you if you want to look it over. I mean I'm going to be here till five, so I'll make sure that we touch base before I leave. Um, if you want to look this over. Yes, if you could you have my email. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Okay, love to dance 36 at Yahoo right. Actually, no, that's not the one I have. I have the at att dot net. That's an outdated one. So it's love. Hold on, let me get in here so I can change it all together. Okay. All right, L O V E. T O dance. 36 at yahoo dot com. Okay, I'll send this right over. I'm going to send the 500 and then the 100 500 deductibles. Um, just I mean we're going to be on the higher end. Just know it's going to be less if we stick with the thousand. Um and it was roughly what do we say 114 if we did the the thousand dollar deductibles. But I'll send these to to you now so you can look them over. Okay, and this you said has to be um auto pay. Yes, we prefer it to be auto pay, but it is this is because they offer a discount when it's on auto pay. I understand, but I I mean I always pay on time, but I have different accounts that I pull from, and since we're on a fixed income, that works best for me. Okay, let me take this off of the auto pay then. And. Okay. And then I'll send those rates to you without the auto pay. Okay, send it both ways. That would be good. Okay, sounds good, Karen. Thank you. We'll we'll touch base in a little while. Yes. Thanks. Thanks. Nice. Bye.
