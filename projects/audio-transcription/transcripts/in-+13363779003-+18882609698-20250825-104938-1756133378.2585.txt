Good morning, Alliance Insurance. Good morning, my name is Karen and I'm calling you on a recorded line from Lakeview Loan Servicing. How are you today? I'm doing good, doing good. How are you? I'm great. Thanks for asking. I was calling to verify homeowner's insurance for mutual customer. Okay, all right. Let me get you over to an agent and they can help you out with that. Now if something happens when I put you on hold for an agent, if they're not available, you can always send a request to us our support email. Do you want that email address? Yes. Okay, so it's support at myallianceinsurance dot com. Okay. Okay. And I can put you on hold if you like. Okay.
