This is Tim. Hey Tim, good morning Jeff Edmonds with Alliance Insurance. How are you today? Doing well, Jeff. How he does? I'm doing great. Thank you. Did the account number come through to you? I do have an account number. Let me get this pulled up for you. Okay, thank you. Yeah, no problem. Sorry, just had to log me out, so I'm logging back in real fast. No problem. There we go. Let me pull up this account number now. All right, I do have it pulled up here. If you would confirm the business name and the billing address, please. Yes, Northside Lanes Incorporated, 3550 North Patterson Avenue, Winston Salem, North Carolina. Thank you, and yes, I do have it pulled up here. What did you want to look at on this one? Just trying to, I guess, figure out. It's showing now in canceled mode, and I'm not seeing. And I might be missing it where they had anything billed. The last payment was made to you guys. It looks like in November of last year, which I'm assuming was renewal. It looks like too that there might have been an audit premium as well as a current term premium due, but I'm not able to pull the invoices for either one of those. So what what I'm ultimately trying to do is reach out to the insurer and let them know what is needed to be paid, and just make sure it's not something they've already. Or at least they already feel like they dealt with. Gotcha. So it does show this policy. It does show a canceled for nonpay on nine three twenty five. And it shows the amount was that that it was that was past due. A total amount showed fourteen forty five, so one thousand four hundred and forty five. It canceled for three hundred six nineteen, and that was an invoice sent out on seven eight due seven twenty eight. Okay. So that is that is the current the update or the policy status. Okay, can you repeat that please? I got some of that as you were going. I got fourteen forty five, and I believe that might be the amount of. One of the audit premiums, I guess. First of all, let's verify. Have they paid anything other than the nine thousand nine hundred thirteen dollars and thirty cents that was paid? November twenty first of twenty four. I'll double check here for you. Okay, thank you. Because it looks like there were two adjustments. There was the audit adjustment for the prior term. November twenty three to November twenty four. Was that satisfied? You check that for you here. And to answer your first question, I do not see a payment after that November payment. So. All right. There is an invoice here. This is for the audit. The fourteen one thousand four hundred thirty five. So it does show there was a payment made on three five. Okay, so three five. Five so the audit was separate. It shows fourteen thirty five was made. I'm just going to check the policy or the payment status. And that was for the prior term. Is that correct? Let me see. Yeah, it shows twenty the effective date nine twenty nine. Nine twenty nine twenty three. So looks like the twenty three to twenty four term I believe. Okay, perfect. And then it looks like an additional transaction of the current term adjustment. Also due to that prior term audit, and is that what generated? What did that generate? So the the invoice that it shows it canceled for was three hundred six sixteen. That's where it shows it canceled for nonpay. There is an invoice for fourteen forty five. I'm just going to make sure that's not audit because I do see they paid the audit. It's usually separated here. And the amount of the audit, which again was for the prior term, was fourteen thirty five. Is that correct? Yes. Okay, and that was paid. March of twenty five. Okay. I'm just going to check the invoice here to see what if that mentions the it's an audit that one thousand. Fourteen actually, what is the Cancellation. Did he get a pending cancel? Did he get any sort of late notice, or was he, should he have? Because it looks like. Yeah. It's fourteen forty-five. It was due eight twenty-eight. Did he get anything after that? Yeah, there should have been a cancel notice here. Looks like. Pending cancel nine eight. Let me see if I can pull that document up here for you real quick. Those I'm not able to pull. I don't think. I mean I I can link the two invoices that you reference. But anything he got other than that, I don't think it's let me pull it up when I click on. There's no hyper link under the transaction column. It's only in the breakdown column, and. They're not really showing me anything. They're taking me to another screen. Sure, let me check to see he should have. It does on the system say there was a pending cancel, so I'm going to see if I can pull that document here for you. Yeah, that would be. Anything he might have gotten in between these. Yeah, it looks like the fourteen forty-five may have transitioned into three hundred six sixteen. It does. It does show that three hundred six sixteen was the initial pending cancel, and that's that's one that I was able to pull up here. Let me save it. And I don't have that invoice either. Now that I see it, the only invoice that I am seeing. Let me go back. Yeah, if I go back far enough, I see three hundred six sixteen. And looks like there there's another invoice of one thousand eighty three seventy seven. In May. Oh yeah, I do see that one. Yeah, because there was a large payment in November that wiped out a few of the monthly installments, and then. It then. Then reversed. Does look. So once they overpay, it just kind of takes out the next one and up until the money is all used up, and then it'll send an invoice out. So. So the first one of those was. In May, but there was no payment made. Is that right? Right. And there was also an endorsement right before that. Which is why it's likely why it didn't mail that right away. So there was an endorsement. And that endorsement was the the current term adjustment from the prior term audit. So I see that. Alright, trying to figure out what makes up what. Alright, so fourteen forty-five. Was the amount of. That current term adjustment. And it looks like he was only billed one thousand. And now it's saying that, but that invoice is not available online. This is the direct notice of cancel. I'm sending to you. Okay, I I emailed you the the first direct notice of cancellation, and then I do have a second a second one for the three hundred six sixteen. Did you want that one as well? Yes, I'll take anything that he was sent. Okay. That will help us explain, and then I've got one final. That's the DNOC that I just received. Okay. And I didn't attach the first one, so I'll I'll just send the other one here real quick. This is the second one that I was able to pull up. It looks fairly similar, but it looks like the dates may be. Altered because it's the second notice here. Yeah, I have that, but now that has. A different effective date that shows for policy effective date nine twenty nine of twenty twenty five. The first one you sent. Had the effective date of nine twenty nine twenty twenty four, which is the current term. Yes, this one is showing. Just clarify. Twenty nine. So they both show the same amount. They show different policy effective dates, however. Okay, from what I see, that the first one I sent you was the correct one because it has the nine. Nine three cancellation date, and that is the day that it showed that it canceled. Alright, so. Where do you see the nine three cancellation date? It's in the middle paragraph there. Okay, got it. All right, so this was what what he received that he needed to act on. All right, hang on one second. So the second one you sent me is is only relevant to the renewal term. Which one? Yeah, that is. Yeah, they once once the previous term gets a denox, so does the the current renewal even if it's not active yet. So that is for the renewal term. So the three hundred six sixteen that was late was actually an installment of a total amount due of fourteen forty five is that correct? From what I can tell, let me see here. After after the large payment applied in the endorsement, it showed it showed that three hundred six sixteen is what was due. Was that the total due or was that an installment of what was? That would have been the um July installment after all those changes. So there was a large payment that paid most of it. As well. Yeah. Or was he? Yeah, it it shows this one set up on monthly, which is where that next fourteen forty five came from. That was the that was the three hundred six plus the next monthly installment which was fourteen forty five. And that three hundred six I can't figure what that was for, where that originally came from. That was after after all the changes and the payments that were made, the July installment became. It would have been around a thousand, but with the payment that applied, it was there was only three hundred six sixteen left. So essentially, from the changes and the overpayment of the previous month. That is what was left. That was due for seven twenty eight the three hundred six sixteen. All right, so then, are you saying that to pay? If he had paid this term in full, it would have been three hundred six sixteen plus an additional fourteen forty five for a total of. Seventeen fifty one sixteen. Is that what was owed? Full. I don't see that anywhere. Let me confirm that for you. Because I feel like. I think the fourteen forty five might be the total. Yeah, the three hundred six sixteen would have been an installment. Correct. So let me let me pull up that invoice here real quick. The fourteen forty five. Because I the the fourteen forty five itself, let's see. That's for the audit. Just confirming this here for you. No, it's fine. Okay, from what I can tell, the fourteen forty five was the remaining balance on the the current term. The night that ends on nine twenty nine twenty five and then there is the the next. Monthly installment of twelve thirty two sixty two is what was due. What would be due if the policy remains active? So that was the remaining balance and the last monthly installment. On this term, on that term. All right, twelve thirty two sixty two. That yeah that was the next monthly installment so doesn't really factor into that fourteen forty five. That was the remaining amount due after the endorsement and um the payment that was made. All right, so two final questions. Assuming that the policy were not in cancellation mode, what is the total amount that he would owe to have paid this up. To the end of this term, which ends nine twenty nine twenty five. Yes, that should be the fourteen forty five. I am just double checking the numbers here real quick. Yeah, let's make sure of that. Number one. Four. Yep. Then that is exactly what it is. So that that remaining invoice of three hundred six plus the the final installment. For August twenty eighth was eleven thirty eight eighty four plus the three hundred six sixteen comes out to one forty five even. Or fourteen fourteen forty five even. All right. Yeah, I am sorry. No problem. Yeah, I understand. And I am assuming that's what he would need to reinstate. Is he in canceled mode or? What's his next step to continue this policy? Yes, it shows the policy canceled on nine three. So the next step is to get underwriter approval and then they would have they would they would definitely need the remaining balance the fourteen forty five and they may ask for it to be set up on auto pay or something along those lines. Okay. All right, and that's underwriter approval. Okay, I think I understand all this now. Thank you so much for your time and your help. I appreciate it. You are very welcome if you'd like. I can check to see who the underwriter is on this one and provide their info if needed. Yep, it's Lake Cobbs. I think I have that. So. Okay. I am good with that. But thanks for your help again. I appreciate it. No problem, Jeff. I hope you have a good rest of your day. Bye bye.
