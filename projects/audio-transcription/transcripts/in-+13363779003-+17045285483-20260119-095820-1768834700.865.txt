Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hey, good morning. This is Amy Milsap. I'm calling about our policy on Milsap Farm LLC. We did not get our well. We've looked everywhere. We didn't get a bill. And as we were gathering tax stuff, noticed that we should be getting a bill about now or it should be actually due before the end of the month. Do you need a policy number? We did. Um, what was the business name again? I'm sorry. It's Milsap's M I L L two L S A P S Farm LLC. Got it. Oh, all right. So yeah, it looks like it is due at the end of the month. Um. Now I don't have access to First Mutual. I don't think. Let me let me see. No, I don't have access to that. Um. Let's see. So Addison would be the best point of contact for that. Um. Let me go see if she can take your call real quick. Um. Okay. And I'm just going to let her know she's like a general question. Um. But I would assume that the bill should already be out because it is already. Pretty much the twentieth of the month. Right. Right. Yes. Yeah. Last year it was um we paid it on the seventh. Of January. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it should already been out since last month. But yeah, let me let me see if you can take your call. I will be. Okay. Uh, right back. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome.
