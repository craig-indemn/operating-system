Thank you for holding this, Gary. Hello, Gary. This is Jimmy Linbury. Hey, Jimmy, how are you? I'm good. I hope you are. I am. I was looking at your quote you sent me yesterday. You have me down as having a 07 Chevrolet Silverado. I don't have that truck anymore. Okay, 07 is gone. Yes, and I now I have a 2019 250 Super Duty truck. It's a Chevy as well. No, it's Ford. Ford 250, you said. Yes. Super Duty. Do you have any numbers on that, Jimmy? A VIN number or anything. Well, I was just going to tell you, Gary. I believe since I since that right there, I'm going to just stick with the insurance I got because I believe it's going to be too close to even. I got you. Changes. I got you. Because I know it's going to be more than the Chevrolet. I know the insurance is going to be more. Yeah, it's going to be higher because I think we had liability only on that other Chevy, didn't we? Gary, I can't remember now. Okay. I believe that with that that being the newer truck and all that. Well, it will be more expensive. You're right. You're right. So I believe I'm going to just stick with what I got because I don't believe it's going to be enough to. To change, just keep just keep an eye on it and if we need to revisit it, you know down the road we can do that. Well, I sure will, and I sure do appreciate you giving me a quote and everything, and thank you so much. No worries, and just let us know if we can help in the future. Okay. Okay, I'll do that. Thanks so much. Thank you. Bye.
