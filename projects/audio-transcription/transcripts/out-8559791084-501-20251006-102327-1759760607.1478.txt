Thank you for calling. Movement. My name is Virgil. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today? Hi there, Virgil. My name is Jamie Flippin. I am an agent here with Alliance Insurance. And I'm calling in to actually chat through some changes that have happened to insurance for a Jonah Lastly loan number to look at is three zero one zero one three nine six nine seven. Thank you. Give me one second. Let me get that pulled up here. Uh oh. My server just went down. But you did say you needed to speak about the insurance policy. Is that correct? Yes, yes, yeah. Look, from what I can tell, I just got off the phone with Jonah. And from what I can tell, it looks like you guys paid an existing policy that that was there with auto owners insurance. But this policy actually got rewritten to Utica National on July 18th of 2025. Okay. And that policy has not been paid. Jonah herself called in to Utica to try to pay it, and because it's a mortgagey build, they would not let her make the payment. The thing's going to cancel in three days for non payment of premium. Okay. I need to get all this cleaned up for. So. Gotcha, gotcha. Okay, so let me get you over to my insurance team, and they'll be able to update that and get a get a check sent out. Do you mind if I place you on a brief hold? That's on. Thank you. All right, one moment. Thank you for calling the insurance service center.

The. The. The. The Yep, you let me know when I need to stop talking here so you can know. But it looks from what I can tell, I just got off the phone with Jonah a few minutes ago. From what I can tell, you guys paid the old policy with AutoOwners Insurance two thousand five hundred ninety three dollars. That policy was canceled on July eighteenth. That money has been mailed back to Jonah. They did issue a check on July twenty third of twenty twenty five. So the new current policy with Utica National has a balance that is due in the amount of one thousand nine hundred sixty five dollars. And they have not received payment yet. Jonah thought that this was already getting paid, so she ignored the first letter or two that she got when she finally called into Utica on Friday. Utica told her that she could not pay the payment because it was mortgage you build to mortgage to movement mortgage services. So they wouldn't take the payment from her. What I think needs to happen here is for you guys to issue a check overnight to Utica National and then she can put the money back in her escrow account. And I think life's going to move on past that, but I don't I don't know how to get you information as far as the bill and where the check needs to go. Understand. No worries. We didn't pay it because we never received a bill, so they probably have the wrong mortgage clause and that may have been a domino effect. But I do want to start by asking the question: Is were you the agent that wrote the previous policy? No, I didn't write either one of these policies. Yeah, I am a service agent. Now that that policy with AutoOwners was written through my office. I personally did not write it. I am a service agent who is just answering phone calls and moving this along. But yes, man, that policy with AutoOwners was written through my office. And the new policy with Utica National is written through my office. Understand. No worries. So what I'm going to have to do is reach out to her just to get her. Well, you saying it was written through your office though, so both policies were through the office. So therefore, I may not need her authorization. There was me. Alliance Insurance Services is the office that I work for. We are her agent. And both of these homeowners policies were written through my office. Do you have current policy? Were written through this agency. Turn turn turn words understand. Yes, I've already used both the previous and current policies. Was written through this agency. So I got I wrote it right. And I do want to start. I can do a verbal update and just confirm so we can get our information verified. So going forward, we can review it. I do want to try to get the policy details. Now please have the term date for the Utica policy again. Yes, man. So I'm looking directly at the Utica National deck page. It shows me July eighteenth of twenty twenty five until July eighteen of twenty twenty six. Perfect. Now please have the premium amount. Premium amount is one thousand nine hundred sixty five dollars. And is that also the balance or is there a different balance? No man, that is the balance that's currently due. Perfect. Now please have the coverage amount. Coverage amount is three hundred twenty four thousand eight hundred dollars. Let me have please have a deductible. Two thousand dollars. Is one storm in hell included? Yes, man, it is. Perfect. There was me. Let's see. And I do want to just um ask you all have the mortgage clause for us listed as movement mortgage LLC. I is a. I think it might need to be fixed here. It does read different. Go ahead, movement mortgage LLC. I is a. O a. A t i m a. P o box two nine four one one Phoenix Arizona eight five zero three eight dash nine four one one. Okay, I'm going to get back to it. Movement mortgage LLC is a O A slash Tima P o box two nine four one one Phoenix Arizona eight five zero three eight dash nine four one one. Perfect, yes sir. Okay, I will need to get that fixed. This shows up as movement mortgage under Luke Georgia. That's currently on here, so I will get that fixed for you. Perfect. And I do want to ask you this: When is the policy? Hold on, the effective date for this policy was July eighteen twenty five to July eighteen twenty six. Yes, man. Perfect. Just wanted to make sure. And let's see when is the policy set to cancel. He unfortunately is going to cancel on October tenth. Okay, there was me. Policy will cancel ten ten twenty five if payment is not received. Okay, and that's including the grace period. Yes, man. Yeah, yeah. Unfortunately, I what I think happened here is if this thing wasn't,
