Sorry, LaFalle Nicole, is not available. Record your message at the tone. When you are finished, hang up or press pound for more options. Hello Nicole, my name is Jamie Flippin. I'm an agent here with Alliance Insurance. Returning a voicemail in reference to Tracy Estep's homeowner's policy that is with Main Street America. Loan number is zero one three three eight four zero eight nine nine. This policy is currently active with Main Street America. It has an expiration date of February nineteenth. And the policy is currently paid in full. There is a zero balance on it. The renewal information is not yet available because this particular carrier is going to non renew the client. They are retiring this homeowner's product and pulling out of the state. So we are going to have to rewrite the homeowner's policy effective February nineteenth. Has nothing to do with this is Estep. That is a carrier decision regarding state guidelines that they are no longer moving forward with. So I did just get off the phone with Miss Estep to verify current information. I'm going to reshop this for her and present a quote to her here the next few days once all that is set in stone. If she agrees to it, can certainly pay you with twenty six to twenty seven renewal information. But outside of that, that's all I have so far. My name is Jamie. If you'd like to call me back in my office all week until five p.m. Every day three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Again, this is regarding Tracy Duffy Estep. Thank you so much.
