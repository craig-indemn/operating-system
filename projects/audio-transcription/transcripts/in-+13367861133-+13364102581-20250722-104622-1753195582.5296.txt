Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? This is Diane Johnson, and we have a boat insurance policy with you guys for a Carolina skiff and jet ski. It's under I believe Samuel or Jane Johnson. Samuel or Jane? Gene G E N E. I'm not sure what name he put it under. If it's under Samuel or if it's under Gene, he goes by Gene. Okay, the last name. Johnson. Okay, I found it. Samuel Eugene and Diane. Yes. Perfect. So um, I have a question. I have two more jet skis that I'm. I'm not sure yet if he's wanting to add these to that policy or if he's wanting to put these on a separate one. How can I get an estimate as to what the insurance would be on these two? Or if I separated them out like one in my name, you know, one on our policy, and then one on another policy. Yeah, um, let me go ahead and get you an agent that can help you with that. Okay. Okay.
