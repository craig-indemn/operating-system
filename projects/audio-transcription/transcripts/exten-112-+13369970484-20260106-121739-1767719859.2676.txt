Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Yes, Brandi. This is an ups the petticoat. How are you doing today? Good. How are you? Okay, I heard got some rental insurance with you, while that. Okay, okay. I went to my landlord, which is my management yesterday. In this situation been going on ever since, last year about who is going to be running the property over here. From my understanding at this time, the rental insurance that I have had with them since I lived over here going on a year now. It the new the company that they they were under Wellington, it no longer exists at this complex apartment. And for some odd reason, she's stating to me that they're going by now some other type of insurance for their property. And it only covers just what happens to the apartment instead of what happens to the client's material inside of the apartment. So I was going to counsel that for this apartment complex. Okay, so the the policy that they have. It's not going to cover your personal belongings. Correct. So the policy that you have with us covers your personal belongings. Oh, okay, so it works. You want to keep this? Yes, this policy covers your personal belongings which you want to keep. Okay, then see. I didn't know that. See because I know when I had took the um. The um, what's that paper that I took around that they needed. I can't think right off hand, but at that particular time last year I took it to them. Yeah, so the so they're just not. They're probably saying that they don't require you to have it, but you do need renters insurance because if you don't have renters insurance, you have. Nothing to cover you if you do something to the place. So like if you catch the place on fire, they're going to ask you to you're liable for those damages. Right. So that's what the five hundred thousand covers you for. So and then on top of that, you have twenty five thousand that covers your personal belongings in the place. So whatever you own inside the unit or your personal belongings, if it was to catch fire and you needed to start all over again with your stuff. You have twenty five thousand to replace those items. Okay, because because when I when I was listening to her yesterday, I said, "Ain't no way it's not fair for the tenant if he's living in your on your your properties. " His stuff can't be covered and y'all only cover y'all apartment. I said that's ridiculous to me. So I say let me get in touch with my insurance agency and talk with them about this situation. So that's what I was actually worried about because I said well if Wellington no longer exists. And you don't even know what company is going to be taking over this complex. I mean, it it don't even make sense to me. So I said once I get a better understanding from Brandi. I know what where I need to be and what I need to do. So I'm so glad that I was able to talk to you because I called earlier but I think you was tied up. But I'm glad we you were able to explain this to me because I said we got too much invested in this apartment. That's our personal items and I would hate to see something happen and we not covered for it. Yeah, no. I've made sure that your policy. I mean, the minimum is twenty five thousand for personal belongings. You can always go up from that and increase it. That's just the minimum. But I've made sure that your renters policy is going to protect you with your needs. Now if that number ever needs to increase and because you buy new stuff every year or you bought a new TV. That might be more than you know other TV. Then we might want to look to increase in. But I would say let's do that from year to year. And typically we're going to give you a call once a year to review your policy to make sure that hey do we need to increase coverage for you? Has anything changed? Things like that. So we'll reach out about that. But I mean, if there's any time that you have any questions on your policies, please feel free to reach out. If I'm not available, any agent here will be able to help answer those questions for you. Especially if it's like you know on your mind and you want an answer now, definitely see if one of the other agents can help if I'm not available. Okay, and another. I have one more question about the car insurance. Okay, with the car insurance coverage. Is it a way that maybe one day we can set out and talk about? Oh, the kind of coverage I was looking at was something like. Okay, if I had a breakdown, I can call someone on their
