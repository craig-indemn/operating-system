Hey Jennifer, how are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm good. Oh, I have a question for you. I sent you an email about Wilmer, but I'm not calling about that. Okay, what did you did you just send it or when you send it? I think yeah I just sent it not so long ago. He's not going to pay anything extra because we're not increasing the payroll. Okay, okay, okay. Because the pay is the same, right? I mean, we're just scheduling him as included instead of excluded. Yes. So the premium itself isn't going to change. Okay, then I'll call him back. Because the payroll's not changing or whatever. Did you already sign that document? I see. No, he's he he asked me about it last week and I forgot to message you, but. You go in and print that for me so I can send it in the travelers. Yeah, I'm doing that right now. But he asked me that before I did anything, but. Yeah, we're not changing the payroll or anything because I think what was 120, 000 or something, whatever it was. Yeah. Was supposed to be with him included. So we're not changing that figure. We just have to actually fill out this form and send it them so they can actually schedule that on the policy. Okay. Got you. Okay, I just signed it. Okay, so do you remember that accident I told you about for Oscar? Yep. Okay. Are you able to see if they have filed a claim? Filed a claim against him. Yeah. Because I thought they were the party that was at fault. Why would they be filing a claim on your policy on his policy? Because remember how I told you that that officer didn't want to do a police report. And I had called him last week and I said, you know, I sent him an email and I was like, hey, you know, like I really, you went out there, you didn't do with a. A police report and you were obligated to do that. I don't know why you didn't. I said we have videos and photos of where you just walked out the vehicle, spoke with the towing company and then left. I said you never had any conversation with us about it. And I said I really need that police report or that incident report because I need to file this on my insurance. And he said that I needed to send him our insurance and I send him our insurance. And I haven't heard back from him, so I called him today and I was put on hold. And nobody answered, so I wanted to see if maybe he gave them our information and they filed a claim. No, there's no claim that's been filed against this. I mean, there's nothing for them to file. Because yeah, that's not like the tow truck had damages or anything, right? I mean, they damaged. No, but you know people will like do anything just to. You know. Yeah. Oh look, he gave it to me. What you just? But he covered. Yes, but he ripped out. You know the part from the bottom where it says how much coverage it has. Okay, so let me send it to you. How much coverage the other person has? Pete. Like you know how they send you the insurance and stuff and they're like, "This is your it's just it said certificate of liability insurance, is that what you need? " Certificate of liability insurance. What for the tow truck company? Yeah, that's what he gave us. Send it to me. Let me look at it so I don't sit here and ask any questions. Why did he send you a certificate instead of just sending you the actual police report? That's what I'm going to ask him right now. I mean, that's still. I mean, the certificate should show you know the policy number and the company that it's with or whatever, and you can call them and file a claim with that insurance company. But you, the whole thing is he's the person that he's the police officer or whatever that showed up on the scene and should send you a police report about what happened. Oh, I need to email him back and say, "Hey, I really would like a police report, right or incident report." Yeah, and you need an incident report. That explains everything that happened with the incident. Exactly. Oh man, I'll tell you. So I just said I sent him a waiting for. What the hell? Why did they send you the top third of it? That's what he sent me. That's the chief sent me. I mean, it's got a policy number and shows the company, I guess, but. Why does it say that cola's ink instead of the cola's towing? Because that's the actual company name. The cola
