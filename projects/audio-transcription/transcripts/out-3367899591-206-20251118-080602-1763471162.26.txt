It is Tuesday morning about 8:07 a.m. I hope you are doing well today. I need, if you can get this for me, the policy number information for the Utica package policy. That last time we saw you over there when Christopher and I were in there to talk with Justin, he mentioned that he was open to us doing an agent of record on that policy and we need the policy number in order to fill out our paperwork on that. If you could please just give me a call back three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. I'm going to shoot you an email as well asking for what I need. But in any event, if you could just get this to us, we greatly appreciate it. And as I said, I'm going to shoot you over an email right now to follow up. Thanks, Ronda. Talk to you soon. Bye bye.
