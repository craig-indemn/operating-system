Hello. Hi Cody, this is Yas from Mission One Commercial Service Center. Before I start this call, maybe recorded for business purposes. So I'm sorry to call guy disconnected. But while I was reviewing our guidelines, I did see here that actually there's a way for us to refund the amount that was charged on this checking account. So basically what will happen is we can request for a manual or I mean for a ACH refund on this checking account. However, just to give you a heads up, once we refund the funds that was charged from the original date when this checking account was registered. On the new checking account that we will register, it will be charged for a huge amount of funds because we need to backtrack the original payment that was charged. But it will depend on if ever they just wanted to be charged for the current term. Or if they wanted also to get refunded from the previous term when it was originally registered. So you can go all the way back to October of 2024. Yes, that is correct. As for our support team, they did confirm we can go back to original date which is October to 2024. But whatever we refund that exact amount will have to be repaid at the exact same time. I'm assuming. Exactly that is correct. What is the total amount to go all the way back to October of 2024? Okay, let me just go ahead and try to calculate on this one. Just bear with me, okay. As I did see here, the history of the payment. Let me just verify. Just give me a moment. So basically we're talking about 15 months. Yes, yes, we're up sending you something like that. And then the payment that was made in October of 2024. Might have even gone before that. Um. Yeah, let me go ahead and confirm it here. Yeah, I just I need a total for every payment that's been made from this incorrect checking account, please. Yes, yes, definitely. Let me just make sure everything is properly aligned here. Yes, bear with me. And that might have even gone back into the 23 to 24 term as well. For that, based on what our system, the notes in our system, and the conversation that happened in our system, I think a payment was made. October 2nd that also encompassed. The 23 to 24 term even from this checking account. If you can just double check that too. Um. Yeah, actually upon checking and verifying on the previous months, I did see here that there was a different checking account. Well, that was registered on the policy. So I can confirm like. Right before the October 2nd of 2024, there was a different checking account which was up being processed for the payment on this policy. So the only payment that this checking account that ends with 8496 started processing the payment back in October 2nd of 2024. Was the account before this 2429 was the last one? Um. Let me verify that one. Okay. Um. Just give me a moment. Yes, the previous account was 24. I mean, I mean it's actually 2429. Okay. Yeah, if you can just let me know what the total is. Once it was changed. Okay. Right now I'm just trying to get the full Easter of the payment. Just bear with me because my system is just loading at this moment. I do apologize. You're fine. I had to backtrack from the start. Okay. So upon calculating all of the payments starting on October 2nd of 2024, which is registered on its checking account, the total amount that was processed is 21, 244. Dollars and 69 cents. 21, 244. 69. Yes, that is correct. And this is from October of 24. To. October 2nd, 2024. Yes, that is right. Okay. Um. Can you go ahead and get this account changed over to the correct checking account for me, please, and then we can deal with the rest of this issue whenever I can figure that out with them. Okay. All right. Let me go ahead and verify it here first. Just give me a moment. Okay. I see. All right. So upon verifying for our guidelines, Cody, it looks like in order for me to proceed with updating the checking account registered on its policy, we'll need to receive first a sign authorization form. To get this automated. That's okay. I'll get that sign. All right. Okay. Thank you for confirming. So. Once I figure out how we're going to handle this, if we even can because this is such a large amount of money. I just
