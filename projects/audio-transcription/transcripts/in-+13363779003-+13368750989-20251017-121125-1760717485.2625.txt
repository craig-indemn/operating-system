Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Tell me, I hope you. Hey, this is Kumar Abbas. I'm actually trying to reach out to Mister Corbin. I just called and somebody answered like sound like on a speaker. And he says he's gonna you know give me one second, put me on hold and nothing and then hung up on me. So he's currently not available. He'll be back in office like on an hour or so. Okay. Uh, can you help me out? Because this is uh I've been I'm trying to find the policy number but. Uh, have an address. You can look up that way if you could. What is it regarding? I received a letter from my mortgage insurance a mortgage place that talking about hazard insurance requirement that is not put on my. Like I've been renewing with you guys from last few years and this one he changed something. Now I received a letter from the mortgage place talking about there's no hazard insurance on it. But if you don't. Uh, buy it. We end up doing it for you without even asking, and then because it's required. So I don't know why something he done that I'm not aware of. You know I'm just receiving a letter now. I don't know how long it's been. I think it's been it came October the sixth. They sent it out and I just received it today, and I just got back home actually so. And it says because the hazard insurance is required on your property, we plan to buy insurance for your property unless you don't do it. You know so that so I'm trying to find out what he did something that is uh it's not meeting meeting the requirement. Okay, so in this case, um, would it be okay if Corbin hope if another agent other than Corbin helped you today? Yeah, that's fine. I just want to take care of this thing because I mean I'll be on the you know honestly I'll be on the road and I don't come home for like a once a week now. So I just I'm mailed behind like I said this was sent out in on the six and today is the I don't know almost fifteen or something. Okay, give me one second. I can transfer it to another agent. I can look into that for you. Yep.
