Thank you for patiently holding. This is Amanda Speaker. Hi, it's Aaron Hunter. How are you? Doing good. I can help you. I'm glad you sent me a reminder because I forgot about it. It's an express loop. Yes, yes. Now on this policy right here, what what all does that policy cover? Me and DC was talking. I said, okay, we got so many things going on. We're trying to figure out which one is this covered. So that's the one that's covering everything as far as your general liability and property. Okay. What about if say that say we're blowing it? Change oil on the engine and blows the engine. Is that covered under this policy? Is on that liability policy. No, that's actually covered under your auto policy. That's your garage and auto coverage right there. Okay. So this is just like if it burns down or whatever and it this is just replacing items like that. Yeah, replacing you know the building, replacing items in the building and anything that you may be held liable for on your general liability side. Okay. So I'm trying to think what else. What what other things like we might be held liability side. Somebody trip and fall, get hurt, try to see you, something like that. Right, something like that. You know something that they you know feel you're held liable for that caused them injury or bodily harm. Got you. Okay. Let me check what they say and I'll send you email right back. What side what we want to. Okay. All right. Thank you. Bye bye.
