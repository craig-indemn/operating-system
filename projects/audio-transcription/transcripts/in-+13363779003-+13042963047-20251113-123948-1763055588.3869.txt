Good afternoon, thank you for calling Horizon Insurance. I'm going to help you. Oh yes, this is Donnie with MPE Rentals in Morgantown, West Virginia. And I have a certificate of liability insurance here from Fraline Marian. What is that name? Sam Moudio. Sam Moudio. And he listed MPE Rentals as a certificate holder, but didn't list the rented or leased equipment valued up to eighty thousand. On this certificate, and I don't know if that's something that I need to talk to you about or on the top of this contract name. A contact name is Cody Jackson. I don't know if I need to talk to him or. I could definitely transfer over to him since that's who was working on it just because I'm also not a licensed agent to fix anything on that. Okay. Yeah, if if I need to talk to him, that'll be fine. Okay, one second. I'll transfer you over. Okay.
