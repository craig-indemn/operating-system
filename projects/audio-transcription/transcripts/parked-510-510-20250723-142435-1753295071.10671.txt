Hi, this is Tracy. How can I help you? Tracy, this is Debbie with First Community Bank. I'm calling about Blue Water Air LLC. I'm checking to see if they renewed their flood insurance. Let me just check that. Yes, I do have a copy of the new policy, so they have renewed it. Um, is there any way you could send me the deck page for that? Sure, what's your email address? E is in Debbie, A, Andrews. At F is in First, C is in Community, B is in Bank. Inc. Dot com. Okay, I will send this over to you in just one moment. Okay, thank you so much. You're welcome. You have a great day. Bye bye. Thanks. Good.
