It's a great data life insurance. This is Jamie. Hi, my name is Sarah. I'm calling from the insurance service center for Valen Mortgage. This call will be monitored and recorded. I'm calling to verify. Renewal information on homeowners policy. Shall I please read the policy number? Yeah, sure. Yes, the policy number is five six two eight two five zero eight zero zero. Okay. All right, so that policy number pulls me into an account for William, Renee Wilson and Lori Ann Calaway, one zero three seven old Highway sixteen in Jefferson, North Carolina. And I do have a active policy that renews tomorrow, November fifteenth of twenty twenty five and runs until November fifteenth of twenty twenty six. Let me just verify coverage for you. Okay. Coverage on the home on this renewal is two hundred eighty seven thousand dollars. There is a five thousand dollars deductible on the policy. And then looking for mortgage information, I've got. I do not have any mortgage information on this policy. I'm guessing you're calling from the bank, so there probably doesn't need to be a mortgage on this. I would need a written request in order to update that information. Okay, I just wanted to know the premium amount for this policy. Yeah, okay, so premium do let's see here. Well, oh, it's already paid. This homeowner's policy. Let's see. Actually, let's see. Okay, so yes, this homeowner's premium has been paid. It looks like being insured.
