Hello. Hey, Miss Tribbett, it's Gary Alliance. Uh huh. Uh huh. I was I was calling you. I know they told me that you came in and paid the progressive premium. But we wanted we wanted to put the auto with the same company that you got the homeowners with so you could get that discount. Um. I thought they would since I signed those papers and sent them back. Well, that was to get the homeowners transferred to us, but the auto quote that I had for you was with the same company that that homeowners was written with. So here's what we can do: you don't renew until the 19th on the auto. So we are going to process a return for you on that progressive premium. Okay. And if you are down this way next week, stop in to sign the request to do all that. Oh, okay. And we will have it out front. Of course, you know I'm I'm here in the office where you just paid, so you you can ask for me if you like. Okay. And and we'll get this this one started so and and the premium is actually just a little bit less than than what you pay progressive. So you're going to get that you're going to get that plus you're going to get the discount on the home side as well. Uh huh. Uh huh. And maybe next week Tuesday Wednesday or whatever, just anytime next week would be fine. Well, I'm still in Winston. I mean, I could run that by there. You can, you can if you'd like. What time do you go to lunch? Well, we close the office at 3:30 today, and I've already had my lunch. So. Oh, okay. Yeah, so if you want to come back by here, we can get that taken care of. Okay, I'm eating lunch right now. That's fine. That's fine. But let's see. I'll just come back by there. Okay, very good. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you. Uh huh. Bye bye. Bye bye.
