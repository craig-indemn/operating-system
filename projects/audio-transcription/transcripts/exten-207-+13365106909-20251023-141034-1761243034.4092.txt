Sorry for your hold. This is Cody Mihelpy. Hey Cody, it's Mickey. How are you? I am good. How are you? Doing good, doing good. Listen, I got a question. I think I know the answer to, but one of our truck drivers got hurt. Okay. And Giovanni wants to use this guy just for some local runs, but he does not have a. A regular license. He has. I don't know what it's even called. So one of the drivers had an an accident or what happened. Yeah, he fell off the back of the trailer. Oh, he got hurt. Yeah. While he was parked somewhere. Yeah, yeah. Well, well, he was at the New York. Okay. But this guy he doesn't have a regular license, but it is a C D L. What do you mean exactly? I guess. Well, it's not like a United States license from North Carolina somewhere in the United States. It's from another country, but I don't know why. And those normally are not. You can't use them. No, you only have a U.S. state license. Okay, that's what I thought, but this guy's telling Giovanni he drives for other people, and he signs. So he was driving for you guys, but he's not. No, no, no, no, no. He says he told Giovanni he drives for other people. Okay. With this license, and I'm like, it's got to be a regular license. Yeah. Um, it has to be a. Well, with almost any company, and I can't speak for every company out there, I guess, but with almost any company you have to have a U.S. based license, like the the Mexico C D Ls and all that sort of stuff. Like typically, those aren't going to apply to most most. Yeah, yeah. Well, I from my back of the day, you know when I was native, I knew you couldn't you couldn't have any other kind of license. No, we we've tried to to quote some drivers that had like Mexico C D Ls and stuff, and it it never worked out well for us. All right, all right. So I needed to know. All righty. Thank you, darling. Yes, ma'am. Have a good one. You too. Bye bye.
