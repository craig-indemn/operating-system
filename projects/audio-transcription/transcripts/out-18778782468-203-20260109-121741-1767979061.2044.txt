Thank you for calling Travelers Consumerwide Service Support. My name is Mark. What's your name? I'm sorry, you said your name is Mark. Yes, that is correct. Hi, my name is Maria. My name, insurance agent with Alliance Insurance. I'm calling in regards to one of our clients. Homeowner's policy. Do you need that policy number? Yes, please. Yes, six zero eight seven one eight two eight five dash six three three dash one. Thank you. For Antonio Piazza. Correct. He said his mortgage company reached out to him, told him he was getting non renewed. I see that, but I don't see the reason why he's being non renewed on March ninth. I see. Based on the non renewal notice here, it appears that the policy cancellation was set because the dwelling roof has missing shingles on it. Okay. Let me pull up the notice here. You didn't receive the notice, the copy of the notice. I don't think that we have yet. So it's missing some shingles. Let me go check. Hold on. Oh, I see. So the the documents will be available actually, or it will be sent out on February second, twenty twenty six, and the effective date of the non renewal is March ninth of twenty twenty six. Okay. Now does he have any options of maybe we're getting it repaired? Those few pieces that are missing, getting it repaired, sent with photos. Yeah, so the customer will be able to address the missing shingles and can send pictures identifying that the shingles are no longer missing. They can also send invoice of the completed work. So we can review it once reviewed and everything is addressed, then we will consider on removing the cancellation of the policy. Okay. I will let him know. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you so much for reaching out as well. Have a wonderful day. Take care. Bye.
