It's a great day. You reached Jennifer. Please leave a detailed message. Thank you. Hi there Jennifer. Good afternoon. This is Jamie Flippin here with Alliance Insurance. Your homeowner's policy is written through my office. The carrier, Auto Workers Insurance, emailed in a request. They'd like to know if you were able to make repairs on the hot water heater that popped a few months back. I did email. I forwarded the email to you. You can call me back or you can just give me a quick little note reply there because I do need to get the carrier some type of answer. But you can just let me know. You know if you've had time to make repairs and if it's all fixed. Three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three the direct office number. I sincerely hope you're doing well. Thanks so much.
