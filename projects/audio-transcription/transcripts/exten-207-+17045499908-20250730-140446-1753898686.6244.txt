Sorry for your hold. This is Cody to help you. Hello, Cody. This is Jackie from Auto Owners Insurance calling you about Amando. Hey Jackie, how are you? That's named Ruiz. I'm good. How are you, Amando? Okay, I'm Amando. So sorry about the delay in calling you back. That's a good one. Was a this one was a little bit weird. Weird in what way? Weird in like just I'm new so I had not seen that sort of sort of debit. Okay. Before, and I was like, help. So. Right. Look at it straight. So what we can do is go ahead and reduce that 40. To a 20 debit. Okay. So we can go in and fix that. Just going in, yeah, you know because are you the one that I was emailing with a little bit? Oh yeah, you and I. I was one who picked that up. Yeah. I got you. Okay. Give me just a second. I'm just getting it pulled up here. Well, I picked up the original one. I don't know. Yeah, I spoke with Angela this morning about this because I just you know I needed to get some clarification because. You know I was putting these debits on these policies because the premiums were coming in very low versus you know what I'm. Typically charged for those and just to help with the. You know potential loss ratio for a claim to occur and just the you know a little bit higher risk or something of these accounts I guess. And then when that got hit with a 32.4% increase for the renewal, which I know you guys are taking rate on everything or whatever, but like. He didn't have any claims or anything with you in his first year, and I just couldn't understand that large of an increase. But then you were also telling me, well we we can't do anything that debit has to stay, and that just really kind of threw me for a loop. Because basically I was told not to put debits on the account unless there is. I guess significant justification to do so, which. I'm correct. Correct. I understand, but I don't. I know I get what you're saying, but to to be honest, like first of all, this is Virginia. That was correct. Yeah, so it states different. Yeah, and from my experience with Virginia, is one Virginia takes forever to to modify rate when carriers go to them. So it takes them forever to do it, but when they do it, it is significant. So like the state rate increases, is that what you're talking about? Yes, yeah, they can be significant, especially if a if carriers have not asked for a rate increase for a number of years. And that's kind of my experience with working with other carriers and the state of Virginia. So that's one thing. So really with them, and when you do submit something, you don't really want to put that kind of a debit on an account. So that was really you know when I started writing some of these VA policies to you guys. I was unaware that I didn't that there were restrictions or there were there was you know we had the availability to put it and so I was just doing what I thought was probably best for the. For you guys and for for us as the agency as well to get premium to the correct level that it probably should be for the risk. And I was told by Michelle Hader Hader Hader. You know we're really not supposed to debit the accounts without you know reason. And usually 40 isn't ever done unless it's. You know multiple things or something I guess like a new venture and tickets and accidents or something that's still acceptable or whatever it may be. Right. So that's why I was doing that on these accounts when I first did it. So now I don't or I do a 10 or or whatever if I feel like any. A little bit or or something or whatever. So. Right, but typically also you you might want to think of it like this: if I if I ever see something, if I had never gotten this first and I saw that 40 on it, I would question the new. Do I want to write it at all? Because yeah, I understand what you're saying. So that's the way you kind of yeah that's the way you kind of want to look at them sometime, but you know. With this one, we learn. Yep. So we learn on this one. Okay. So hopefully they'll still take that. If not, we may still in you know because a for you take 20 off. It looks like that's going to take off about. What 2400? It's not about right. 25 25. On my head. Yeah, on my head. Yeah,
