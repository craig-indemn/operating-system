Hello. Hey, this is Tracy. It is. Hey, Jeff Edmonds at Alliance. How you doing, man? I'm doing well with one on your world today. Not too much. Did you get a message from Joe? I don't want to tell you something he's already told you. I did and I just called and got his voicemail. Okay, he's in a meeting with another client. I'm just following up because I'm hoping we can get this taken care of today. When I got in this morning, I saw Northside lanes on my policy cancellation list. So I went in and dug around in the Westfield site. And basically what I found out was you guys had an invoice. I don't know if you remember any of this, but back in I believe it was late winter early spring. You guys were sent an invoice for audit premium for the general liability general liability policy from the prior term. From September 23 to September 24, you guys had more sales than you anticipated. Paid premium on, so they sent you a bill. Of like 1435 dollars to pay the difference in premium for that policy period September of 23 to September of 24. Okay, no issue with that. What they also did was shortly after that they sent out a second invoice and an endorsement. For the term that we're in now, September of 24 through September of 25, updating those exposures to reflect what the audit showed from the prior year. They sent an invoice for 1445 at the same time. So that is the invoice that has not been satisfied. It rode up until I want to say July because you guys had paid a bunch of premium you paid most of the year. And even though that thing invoiced in the spring, nothing was sent out again until July because there was enough money in the account to cover the premium. Apparently another invoice was sent out sometime in July, which was not for that 1400 dollars. It was for like 306 because they were going to allow that 1445 to be paid monthly. From July through the end of the policy term, which is September. Very confusing. I get all that. But. Nope, I'm just going to finish. When the 306 dollars did not get paid by September the third, it put the policy in cancellation mode. And that's where it sits now. So to get the policy reinstated, two things need to happen. I need to get a statement of no loss. Esigned, which is very easy to do. I just send out an email that gets esigned stating that you've not had a loss since September the third. Once that's done, that allows the policy to be reinstated pending payment of the 1445 that was originally billed back in the spring. I hope that makes sense. If not, I'll be glad to walk you through any of that that you don't understand. Okay, well, like a Rocky Rocky does take care of the bill pay and we were talking about this and he saw the 1435 and that part got paid with like a we paid like a 9000 dollar or something. And to satisfy the paying everything in full or so we thought, so then we see the 1435 that got paid and now 1445. We're thinking why we're paying that number again. Right, and that that is that was my assumption for what happened. And just to rehash, the 1435 was for the actual audit premium from the 2324 policy year. The 1445 was when the current terms numbers were changed to reflect what the prior term audit reflected. Just so you wouldn't have an audit premium next year if your numbers ended up being as good or better than what you expected them to be. Some companies do that. Most companies do that. Some companies don't. But what is understood is the I guess assumption that this was a duplicate bill and it had already been taken care of. Yeah. So we have already gone to Westfield and explained that on your behalf, and they're willing to reinstate the policy pending the two things I mentioned earlier. I can send the statement of no loss. Any you or Rocky, the one can basically sign it. Is it okay if I email that to you and you do the esign on it and then I will send that to Westfield? That will open billing up to accept the payment of 1445, which will reinstate the policy for the rest of the term. Okay. Yeah. Go ahead and send me that. I'll sign that just as soon as I get it. Yep. And and then I'll see Rocky in the morning and try to explain this to him as best I can. If he has questions, you have them call us. Yeah, it
