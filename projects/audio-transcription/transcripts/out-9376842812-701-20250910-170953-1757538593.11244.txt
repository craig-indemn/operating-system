Hello. Hey Emma, this is Jeremy of Alliance Insurance. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing good. Thank you so much. Let's see. I have got your figures. For your coverages there, I know I had texted you and kind of told you what we were looking at savings wise. So we're insuring the home for three hundred. Almost three hundred twenty-nine thousand dollars based on rebuild cost. And your perils will be covered at twenty-five hundred with the exception of wind or hail. And that'll be one percent of that three hundred twenty-eight thousand eight hundred seventy-five dollars. So that would be like. Thirty-three hundred bucks is what I would say if we have a wind or hail claim until that roof is then replaced. Now when you replace it. And we get documentation indicating that we can then put it as replacement cost. In place for the wind hail and take that one percent halt. Okay. Okay. So overall, what that does is I think currently you were paying somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty-seven hundred dollars. I believe on the home side. And yeah, twenty-seven twenty and this policy with this company which is Cincinnati Insurance Company. Alone is twenty-one thirty-six. So that saves me about six hundred dollars right there. On the home and you're getting higher coverage than what you had previously as well. Okay. Let's see. The do you have any questions about that first one? I'm sorry. No, no. Okay, excellent. This would be mortgage you build so. The coverage will be bound today as well, and then the mortgage company would be notified. Of the new policy and they would be able to issue payment that way. Okay. The auto side you were paying let's see let me close that let me close it. So right now you were paying seventeen eighty-six twenty-eight. Every six months, so for a year and the policies I talk in annual terms because that's the policies that we write here are for twelve months. Have that rate locked in for twelve. And that way you kind of know what's going on. So your auto was currently three thousand five hundred seventy-three dollars for a year. Okay. And with Cincinnati, same company like I said we we didn't change anything there. The same coverages in place with deductibles for your common collision and all those things. Is fifteen seventy-three, oh nine for a year. So that comes out to being. Within forty cents of being two thousand dollars of savings for the year just on your auto. Yeah that's amazing. And I also included an umbrella policy with the quote with Cincinnati as well million dollars. And that's two hundred sixty-six dollars for the year which brings your savings roughly to. That twenty-five hundred dollar mark for the year. If you're good with saving money. Oh I'm good with it. Okay excellent excellent. So the next step that we would decide right here would be okay. Do you want to pay the auto upfront for the year? At fifteen seventy-three oh nine or would you prefer to break it down into like a payment cycle if you will? And there's no right or wrong answer with that. The payment cycle tends to be a little bit more, but it may not be very much at all considering with. Cincinnati. I'm scrolling to look at that number. So yeah, it would be fifteen seventy-three if you paid it upfront for the year. If you do it monthly, it's sixteen forty-two for the year. So it's about. Sixty-five dollars more for the year if you do monthly. You can also pay every three months, or you can pay once every six months. You tell me what works best for you. I'm trying to think. So how much would it be monthly? Monthly, it would be. I got to do the math. What the price was for the year you would have had a heart attack. I told you. Two hundred dollars a month, right? Yeah. You're looking at about one hundred and thirty-seven dollars a month. Okay. Yeah I'm good with monthly. Okay. And on the umbrella, do you want to pay that two sixty-six just upfront for the year and be done with that one? Yeah that's fine. Okay excellent. So the way we would do this is EST you know knowing you're checking in an account number. Your routing number and account number would work best, and then I would email these documents to you probably in the morning to sign. But everything will be bound and effective for today. Did that work? Yep. Okay. Excellent. Excellent. All right. Well let's see I got ea hunter rn at gmail is that still accurate? Yes. Perfect. Perfect. All right. Hopefully you didn't have to work today. I think you would be. No. Is that correct? Yeah I'm off today. Good for you. Yeah. Good for you because I know I can't imagine what you go
