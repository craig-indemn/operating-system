Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hi, I was trying to reach Brian Leftwich. Okay, is he expecting your call? Uh no. Okay, all right. Um, let me see here, and what's it regarding to? Uh, mod advisor. All right. So what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna transfer you over to his extension because it looks like he's not available at the moment. Is that okay to leave a voicemail with him? Sure, that would be fine. Thank you. Okay, yeah, no problem. I get his extension here. Sorry, we have new extensions, so I'm having to look everybody. Oh, that stinks, especially when you get the others memorized. I know. Okay, here we go. Hold on, just. Thank you. Yeah. Sure. Good day. You as well. Thank you for.
