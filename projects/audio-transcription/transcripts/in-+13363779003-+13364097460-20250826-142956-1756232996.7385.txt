Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hey, um, who am I speaking with? This is Dina. Dina, hey Dina. Um, I'm trying to get a hold of Chase. Um, I can't seem to find his cell phone number. I've had it, but. Been dealing with him five years, and I'm talking to him about some insurance. Sure, absolutely. Um, let me transfer you over. Um, I can put you over to his voice message. Would that be okay? And just give me his number. It's not like I don't have it in one of my phones. Well, I can't give out any personal information on him, but I could transfer you over to leave a voice message, or I could send him a message too. Can I? Can you? Okay. Yeah, I can hear you. I'm just. Sorry. Give me second to think, make a decision. Let's wait on. You have a pretty good day. Um, let's see here. Yeah, I do. I guess just send me to his voicemail. Okay, all right, very good. So hold tight just a moment. Thank you, dear. Thank you. You have a good day. You too.
