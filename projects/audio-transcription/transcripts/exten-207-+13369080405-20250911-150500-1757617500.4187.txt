Sorry for a hold. This is Cody. Can I help you? Hey Cody, this is Juan. Hey Juan, how are you, sir? Fine. I want to check on you. Can you pick something? I'm still waiting to hear back from my underwriter to see what they can do about getting that money refunded because right now they're trying to hold it until you complete your audit. So I'm trying to see if they can issue the refund without waiting for you to do your audit. Hello. Yeah, okay. Yeah, because they first told me that they were going to have to they were going to hold the money until you completed your audit and then it would get figured out at that time whether or not money was owed or what. This is not right because after you in a way. Had to give the money. Uh, Juan, when you cancel your policy, we can't control you know what else happens in regards to drafts and stuff like that. So I submitted the cancellation request as soon as I got the signed cancellation form back. Yeah, but in a way to give the money like that because I understand I am trying to get the money for you Juan but I can't control what a company you will and won't do so I'm trying to make them give you your money. And then you just need to do your audit, but right now they are saying they are going to hold the money until you complete your audit. But I am trying to see what I can do for you. Because I don't got money, my company know they don't have to take my money. Well, they drafted your money because your your draft date was the day that I submitted the cancellation form. So it had already drafted by the time I got to the office on Monday morning. And I sent it as soon as I got here, but it had already drafted at that point. No, had to pay or money doesn't matter. I understand. I'm sorry for whatever is going on with the bank in your account or whatever. I'm trying to see what I can do for you, but I'm at the mercy of the company and what they are willing to do or not. So I'm waiting to hear back from my underwriter and then as soon as I do, I will let you. Man, it's way with you because when you have to charge me the insurance you never do it when you have to do it you do it. I literally sent the cancellation form as soon as you signed it. You signed it on the weekend. I sent it to you Friday afternoon. You didn't sign it until Saturday and Monday morning. I sent it to the company. Your draft date was Monday and they drafted that morning. You know right? You know you know I'm not really right person. Oh no. You have to try to be understanding of where I'm at too though. I literally sent it in as soon as I got here this morning on Monday when you signed it over the weekend. If you would have signed it Friday, they would have canceled your policy Friday. You're going to send the Friday. I got the mailable mailable Saturday morning. I don't got Friday. It came Friday because I signed it Friday. I filled out the form on Friday and that and you got it the same time on Friday as well. I've done everything that I you've asked one. I can't do anything else, buddy. I'm sorry and I'm trying to get them to refund your money, but I also can't make an insurance carrier do something they're not willing to do. So I'm waiting to hear back from my underwriter as far as what they will do in regards to the money. But as of right now, they told me that they're going to hold the money until the the audit is completed. I send the paper for the housey, but they don't know. I don't know, man. You know that right is no. You know a city's company. I guess. This is very normal with an insurance company, Juan. Unfortunately, you requested to cancel the policy right before the draft. And didn't sign it the day that I sent it, and so by the time I could send it to them, it was your draft date. It's just bad timing, is all. It is. It's not really anybody's fault. It's just bad timing, and unfortunately, some insurance carriers in these situations when you cancel a policy in the middle of the term, they will do things like this because they want to make sure that you complete your audit. Hmm. You're not right. The only thing I know is not right. It. I check on you tomorrow. You pick something because I really need to get my money back. I understand, sir, and I am doing everything I can to try to get them to refund your money. Well, enough. I'm doing everything that I can. One. Well, enough, man
