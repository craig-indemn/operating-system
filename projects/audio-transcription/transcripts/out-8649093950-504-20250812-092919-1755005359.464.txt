Hi, you have reached Marty. Thanks for calling. I will call you back. Leave your name and number in a brief message. Thanks. Bye. At the tone, please record your message. When you finish recording, you may hang up or press one for more options. Hey Marty, this is Holly at Alliance Insurance. I'm giving you a call in regards to your glass claim. I have talked to the Piedmont Tried Auto Glass and they have said they've left you several messages. The lady that's been trying to reach you does leave before 4 p.m. So that may be why you guys are missing each other. Another agent can handle the claim after 4 p.m. So if you would just give the office a call when you can after 4, to make sure that you are connecting with somebody. The office number to call for Piedmont Tried Auto Glass is three three six seven two two two four two eight. And if you need to call us, bye. I do leave at 1 p.m. as well, and I have all the notes in the system. So anybody should be able to give you that number or assist you further. Three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thanks. Bye bye.
