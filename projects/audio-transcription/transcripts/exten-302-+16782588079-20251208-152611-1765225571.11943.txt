Thank you for holding, Misses Donna. How can help you? Hey, Donna, this is Barbara Green. How you doing today? Hey, I'm good. How are you? Oh, I'm good. I'm just you know redoing a lot of things. So calling you on Carson Industries. Do you know why they moved coverage mid term? Yeah, they um got bought out. Oh, okay. Yeah, they were in their plan or anything like that. They just were offered an offer they couldn't resist. Oh, okay. It's it's not on there. That's why I was asking because you know that's the difference. So that would be done pro rata as opposed to short rate. Gotcha. Okay. Sorry about that. That's right. I'm still. That's what. See. Yeah, we're definitely sad to see them go. They were one of our biggest accounts. I know. So give me a second so I can type this. Okay. Got me. I can almost spell today. There we go. Yeah. It's a Monday. It is a rough Monday. Okay. All right. So who bought them out? Do you know? Um, let me see. Some big investor company. Hate it. Oh yeah, um. He just emailed me with his new name on there. Let me see. Um, they're called Walter Group LLC. You wonder if we insure them. No, they're like um. They're more of an investment group. Their insurance is going to be more higher up in corporate kind of world or something like that. Yeah. Right. You know I got some. Oh, we do have the Walter Group. Well, don't make me long. Don't make me long. We quoted, but I don't think we currently insure them. Yeah, I've never heard of them, and we tried to keep the insurance. I think they're all changing it to keep it within the house. I hate it. All right. So that was our baby account. I believe. All right. So we're met. Okay. So are you also the Anna Joyce on the Stokes Tire and Automotive because I left chasing voicemail he ain't called me back. Oh, sure I am. Yeah. All right. So I can do two different things. Okay. So I can I can see I can put it through as an endorsement. Looks kind of trashy, or actually I can cancel rewrite them. Uh, get into the number have everything right and pretty on it. And this is for the renewal. Which one? Yeah. So yeah. So okay. So I'm going to tell you what happened. Okay. So you know we automatically renewed 95 percent of our stuff. So we never see it, and that that's actually what happened on these. So I'm going to have to go back through and look at them, but I know y'all are wanting pricing changes on them as well as the schedule mod change. So that would be two different endorsements on on the accounts when I can just do like a cancel rewrite. And uh. How long you cancel fix? Couple of days. But that that would give you the choice of you know what I can I can do a quote on it if y'all want to present them and not bind the new policy until uh. Until everything's right. Okay. If a quote shows everything correct with the mod changed and or the rating and the pay from peril, then that's fine. He just wants to put a presentation together because it's one of his bigger accounts as well. Put a presentation together to present before we um. I guess fully renew. Cool. All right. I will have that set up and we'll go from there. I'll talk to you later. That sounds great. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Alright.
