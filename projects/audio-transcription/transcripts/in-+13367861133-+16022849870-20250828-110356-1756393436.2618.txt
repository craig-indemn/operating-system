Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Tell me, I hope you. Yes, I can. I speak to Corbin Dirk. Um. Give me one sec. Could I get your name, please? Um, my name is Sam. Okay. Was there projecting a payment by any chance? Yes, yes, yeah. I think you transferred me and it went to voicemail. I actually gave you a call earlier. This is Karen. I left you that voicemail. I wasn't able to reach you this morning. But I went ahead and gave you calls to go ahead and get that um payment taken care of for you today. Can you do that? Oh. Can you do that? Take that payment for you. Okay. Which policy would it be for? Um. The car. I mean, the the policy. What is it for auto? Yeah, for the auto. Okay. All right. Give me one sec to get that order for you. Okay. Okay. So the amount would be. One thousand eight hundred sixty-four with fifty-six. Um. That's another thing I want to talk to you. Is um, Corbin and I went over and at Jeff. I think he took one of the um. The the the health insurance out and it come down to seventeen something. Can you double check on that? If you check the health insurance out. Yeah, the you know checking it. If you have accident, then that like couple thousand dollars went to your hospital bill and stuff. He took that one out because I already have health insurance through my company. Okay, so with that, I wouldn't be able to check directly because I'm not a licensed agent. So I'm not able to look further into people's policies. I can help with things such as payments and um things of that sort with certain certain documents. But I wouldn't be able to go ahead and see that um certain health insurance was taken off, or if it's still on. Okay. That means I have to wait for Corbin. Um. Yes, I could go ahead and transfer you over. Okay. Okay. If you'd like, give me one sec. Thank you. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance Services.
