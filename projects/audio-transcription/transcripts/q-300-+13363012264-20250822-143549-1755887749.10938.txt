It's a great afternoon of lines insurance. This is Jamie. Hey Jamie, this is Heidi Joyce. I've got my car insurance with you guys. I used to be with Progressive and then they dropped everybody, so I think we ended up switching to Amica if I'm not mistaken. But I'm thinking about trading in one of my vehicles and I wanted to check the one that I'm going to. I'm thinking about getting. I will be financing it, so I'll have to have full coverage on it. But it's a year 2000 model and I wanted to make sure I know that sometimes can be a kicker on whether or not it could be insured. Well, first things first, I can probably attempt to quote it for you either way. And then, and and I guess also in transparency. Really, the only hang up to it is just the fact that as a vehicle gets older, Heidi, the value of it decreases, right? So a personal auto policy here in North Carolina will always. Always is too much of a word there because there is a agreed value collector. Boy, I don't want to get on that rabbit hole here. The majority, the vast, vast majority of auto policies in North Carolina pay out on actual cash value, which means that in the event that this thing was crashed. And the carrier totaled it. They're going to look at blue book value. They're going to Google what that vehicle sells for your zip code and they're just going to stroke you a check for it. And so the older the vehicle gets, the less that money's going to be, right? So if you're paying a couple grand a year for full coverage, but the vehicle is only worth three grand, then that doesn't. That use isn't worth squeezing, I guess to be the way to say that. But a bank loan is going to nullify that information because the bank's not going to loan you that money unless they're listed on the policy anyway. So that I would say if you do this, just try to pay it off as quickly as possible and then. Probably either raise the deductibles up or strip it liability only once you satisfy the bank loan. I can quote this for you either way though. My phone system pulled me into Heidi and Christopher Joyce 1174 Brooklyn Avenue extension. Just want to make sure that's accurate and then I do have your auto policy. It looks like it's with Progressive. Let me make sure this is accurate information here. Is this active? It shows active in my system. Yeah, it's active. Okay, active auto policy with Progressive 1174 Brooklyn Avenue. I've got you and Christopher and Timothy are on here. It's like one, two, three vehicles. Are we going to replace any of these vehicles or trade them or or we just add in a fourth one too? The 95 Pathfinder. But are you absolutely certain because I had gotten a letter I want to say last year maybe that Progressive was just dropping everybody that we had ended up switching over and I really thought we switched over to Amica. But I did it through you guys so. Let me look backwards here and make sure I'm not crazy. Let's see all of. Now I'm kind of wondering that would have been the homeowner's insurance. Would have been it might have been the homeowner's insurance. Not the. Let's see. Your home policy shows shows to be active with Utica Mutual Insurance. Utica, that's it. That's it. So I am Progressive still. I'm so sorry. I am going crazy. No, it's okay. Oh, I see it. I see it. Looking backwards, yes, ma'am. Your home and your auto was with Progressive and then it looks like we rewrote your home policy to Utica National Insurance. Yeah. It shows to be active in my system. Your auto is still with Progressive. Okay. And then looking at this Progressive portal here, it does show me that it's active and you are on monthly payments. That's correct. And I mean your checking account. So yes, ma'am, it's it's there. Okay. Okay. It's okay. Insurance is not front of mind. It's or should it be? It's it's okay. Just I would say put out of this stuff at least once a year or so to make sure everything is still good and green with it, but outside of that. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's stuff stuff gets forgotten about that's okay. Okay, so we're trading the Nissan Pathfinder in this transaction. Okay, all right. And where are you at in this process? Is this something that you're kicking the tires about just to see what the price could be or are you on your way to the dealership now? No, no, no. I'm not on my way now. Yeah, okay, all right. Well, I think just for Home, they can get beat left, right, and center. So, and they didn't—I don't know that they really had gotten beaten, but we had gotten a letter in the mail that said that we were basically being forced to pick somewhere else because of some kind of North Carolina code that. That they couldn't overcharge us so much. That well, so that's essentially them telling you that we're not going to be competitive with it. It's it's yeah, not the good underwriting home because it don't matter at this point you you already gone from them but like for example. You know, we'll have people call us and say, "My auto is with Progressive already. I want you to quote my home through them." But depending on the characteristics of the home, Progressive may not even quote it. Their system won't even quote a home unless the roof is less than ten years old. But their preferred pricing goes out to clients who have a roof that is five years old or less, or it's a brand new construction home. Which knocks which knocks out a whole large number—the population of people that they're going to quote—and even then, Heidi, they still normally get beat by other carriers that are just more competitive with homeowners' products. Gotcha. Their bread and butter business is personal auto and toys—you know, golf carts, scooters, boats. I personally have had my boat insured. Well, I think that I've had two boats insured with Progressive since 2013, and I do push that information out about every three or four years or so to look at it and then a single little carrier up there that is either getting close. Apple's to Apple's coverage and money than Progressive does, so I absolutely don't mind shopping this thing to see for you in October in early October. Depending on what you know, Progressive does your information moving forward. They still may, they still may, it might make sense to keep it there. Yeah. I will tell you this though, just so you are aware of it. I'm not looking upset you. I'm not looking to like you know send you off the deep end, and there's absolutely no reason to lose your sleep over. But North Carolina itself bumped the rate for auto and home this year. That changed. They also they also changed auto laws for the first time in 26 years. So at minimum, your home and your auto policy are going to increase at least seven and a half percent when when they renew. Okay, that stinks. I know it stinks, but I'd rather you know it now than to freak out later because that's what people are doing right right now. One of our longtime clients is going to open their mailbox and their forehead is going to separate with anchor. It's happening. People are price sensitive. Everybody in their mom is price shopping right now. Yeah. Heidi, this is not going to be the last time your insurance goes up in cost. Okay. North Carolina has also told us there's a rate increase coming in 2026 and it's a it is a base rate adjustment. So state farm clients are getting it, Geico, Liberty, Progressive—you name it—everybody's even me. I'm an agent, but I'm also Jamie. My home, my auto—it's all getting adjusted. It stinks, but the industry itself across the board—it is not as healthy as people think that it is. In the last several years, the high inflation, the bad weather, the catastrophic losses that you know make news, it's affecting rates in every single state. So again, I'm not telling you that to make you mad. I want you to know it so you guys can budget accordingly because it's coming one way or the other. Or I guess people can walk, but you know that's all that's all other thing there, right? So. Yeah, I would say call us October 9th or a few days before, and we can put the system to work for you and we'll certainly quote it through Utica just to make sure. Generally speaking, Progressive beats Utica off the auto product, but I do see some there. We do have some. I'm not just a handful. We have a bunch of clients who are auto and home packages together with Utica. You know, it it rubs balls down to your information. You know, your your vehicles, your credit score, all that jazz. So yeah. So she had quoted me like, oh, I guess it was probably in August or before that when I had adjusted. I don't know when, but she had looked into it and said it was basically going to cost me what I'm paying now for Progressive removing Tim's full coverage. I would pay the same price but still have the full coverage. So yeah, yeah, well, one way of that. Hopefully, I can end up getting it where maybe we could save a
