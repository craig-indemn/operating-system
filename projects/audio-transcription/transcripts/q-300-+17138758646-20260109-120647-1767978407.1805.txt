Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Hey Brandy, this is Daryl Rogers. I'm calling from my mom, Rita Rogers, and she's got an auto insurance policy with you. We were going down 268. Take her to a doctor's appointment, and on that two lane road, a truck went by and a rock flew up and pinged her windshield. She's got a little ping mark. Um, it's not a crack, but it's a ping mark. And I wanted to get your thoughts as to, can go get that repaired, or you know whatever. I know there's all kinds of places that can go do that, but I want to just at least call you and give you the. Give you an option, or please tell me what I could do. Yeah, so um, if it's just a um, like it's not an actual crack. No, it's a little ping mark. It's probably the size of a dime, maybe a quarter at the biggest. Okay. Um, I mean depending on you know I I guess how big it is and what it could possibly turn into. Um, by the time we do get somebody out there, we do work with a company called Piedmont Tire and Auto Glass. Um, they'll be the best ones to tell you whether it's going to be a repair or a replacement. For repair, you're not going to cost anything. For a replacement, um, it should be the deductible which I'm pulling up right now, um, and that is 100. Okay. So I mean, if you're if you're okay, I I can go ahead and send the information to Piedmont Tire and Auto Glass. They can reach out to you and set an appointment, and they will actually come out to you. You don't have to go to them. Oh, that's even better. Okay, perfect. Um. You can see this phone number. Can I give you another phone number too? Yeah, is this you? Are you calling off a Rita's number? No, I'm calling off my mobile. Okay. Yes, what number should I? Let me give you two numbers, both of my mobile numbers, and I'm going to be here for several weeks hanging out with mom. Seven one three, eight seven five, eight six four six. And then another number. You can try either one. I'll see both three four six, two six nine, three zero four nine. And I apologize, I'm on a treadmill. I'm calling back to you seven one three eight seven five eight six four six three four six two six nine three zero four nine. Okay, got it. And if you need my email address, would that be useful? Is that you got enough with the phone numbers? Yeah, I'll take an email address because they may be able to at least send everything to you by that. Yeah. Okay. That's my first name Daryl D A R R Y L. One two one three at iCloud dot com. Daryl one two one three at iCloud dot com. Okay, and do you want me to make you a contact also on your mom's? Yes, please. No problem. That way, whenever you call in, if it's for her or. Perfect. Yeah. For you know about her policy or anything like that. Yeah. Um. Because we've talked to her caregiver before. But we don't have them as a contact. Obviously. There's six of them too, and they sometimes get a little confused as to what to do. So no, that'd be perfect. Yeah, that'd be great. Okay, and um, let me. Now does she also have homeowners under y'all? It's just the auto. I can't recall. No, we have the home as well. Oh, then both of them are with. Okay. Both of them are with Penn National. But yeah, in our system, once I put you as a contact, it'll be for both. Perfect. Thank you so much. Yeah, you're welcome, Daryl. Now, like I said, Piedmont Tire and Auto Glass will reach out to you to schedule an appointment. Um, and it and I do need to just verify it is for the 2013 Caddy, correct? It sure is. Yep. Okay. All right. And that thing's only only still got like 46, 000 miles on it. Oh wow. Yeah, exactly. Well, I'll definitely send this over to them, and they'll reach out to you. And once they look at it, they'll let you know what what they think it'll be. Okay. Perfect. I really appreciate it. You're welcome. I hope you guys have a wonderful weekend. Yeah, happy Friday, and you have a great weekend too. Thanks. Bye
