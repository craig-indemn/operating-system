Thank you for holding. This is Holly. How can I help you? Hey Holly, how you doing this morning? Good. How are you? I'm good. Thanks for asking. My name is Elia. Was just calling in behalf of my husband Juan Jose. He wants to remove the full coverage from the Tundra. Okay. The 2014. He wants it for like a regular regular 1004 wooded avenue. It's in Winsome. Okay. Let me get it pulled up here. Thank you. I got a policy number if you need that. I think I have it with National General. Yes. Okay. The is it the 2014 Tundra? Yes. And we just want to drop that down to liability. Yeah, I think yeah, just regular insurance because he very uses a ton of too much often so he wants to go ahead and drop it off. I was like, are you sure about that? I was like, what. So I'm just gonna keep you know my the Nissan in the Tundra's gonna be regular insurance and then I'll just keep the full coverage for the Honda Civic the way it is. Okay, perfect. And you want me to take that coverage off effective today? Um, is um, does it affect on anyway or no? Since they charged yesterday for that. Yeah, so if it if if you take it off today, it won't charge one forward after today. Okay, that's fine then. Um, and how much will be paid with the house and the cars monthly now since the Tundra dropped down. I'll have to go in here. Yeah, because we paid that it was almost three thousand three hundred dollars and my husband like that's a lot of money insurance. I need to find another insurance to give us you know a better um offer because National General is really high. Three hundred. All right. So on the auto, it drops it 351 dollars to drop the Tundra down to liability. So 351 dollars from now until the renewal in 2026. Let's say me. Okay. So my auto will be 22209. Is it 222? Uh huh. After the Tundra drop off. After the coverage, yeah, it's dropped. Yes. Okay. And how much is for the home now? Is the house paying still because we have an I don't know why we are where our insurance is really high and with the house in there which we get discounts and stuff but we started paying like 170 something and now we're paying like is it 256 before the Tundra was dropped down and he's looking to see if you guys can either help us to see we can get a you know better insured and a lower rate because it's just that we're paying really high. Yeah, let me look at when the renewal date. Yeah, you don't know because I try to do state form and stuff like that but I don't know how to do nothing like then I don't want you know go in there and try to mess up something you know. Right. Yeah, we'll look at it here. They did something better. Okay, the premium on the home is 1408. You're on a four pay plan, so it's about 352 every three months. 352 every three months.
