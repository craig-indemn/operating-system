Sorry for your hole. This is Cody. May help you. Hey Cody, this is Claudia. How are you? Hey Claudia, I'm good. How are you? I'm doing well, getting ready for this Thanksgiving holiday. There you go. You going to visit? Are they coming down or what? What are y'all doing? Oh, I'm going to visit. I'm going to visit them this year. Okay. They're they're hosting Thanksgiving, so. Well, good for you. Get to see all the grand ideas. There you go. So, hey, I was just, and this is probably my mistake, but I'm calling on. Hey, Sue Cruz Miller, the carport that we just issued. Well, I approved it. Right. Are they a sole proprietor? Because we weren't supposed to be doing any more work comp on sole proprietors. Work comp. And I I'll tell you straight up. I didn't even think about that when I. Soon it in to be honest. I missed. I missed it and I just happened to be putting my documentation in and I'm like, oh, oh goodness. Yeah, I didn't think about that one. I approved the quotes to be honest. And everything I and I know and I know. Um, what you would call it's going to say something to me. I I approved. I did not even think about it. I. I didn't either. To be honest with you, or I would have quoted the comp somewhere else. I mean, I'll just be straight up. I did not even. Catch it until now. Everything I didn't even when I was quoting it to be honest. I didn't even think about it. I was just inputting him like I normally do. I excluded him on the. On the quote and I didn't even think twice. I'm just. I'm just I'm just going to let him know that it was my fault. I did not catch it. I didn't. I didn't even pay attention to it. Yeah, and I because I've been thinking about it twice to be honest. I've been so used to plugging it in. Wait, I've been so used to issuing them that, but so I own it. And everything because I didn't catch it. Well, in the future, I will. I'll make sure on the sole. I look the comp elsewhere. Look, I still don't understand it because it doesn't make any. And my understanding was after our conversation. You know with Nate and Brian. It sort of seemed like it was going to be, you know, okay as long as we were you know listing included excluded on the the owner or whatever, but. I know that they're not. I honestly I still don't really understand what the difference is. They're included or excluded. Well, and if it's an LLC, so I don't truly understand what the actual issue is. But I think their issue. And I and I can think. I'm thinking of it from a work comp standpoint. If the individual doesn't have any other insurance or whatever, it poses in it. They call it a risk that will end up if if something happens to him and we're including him under the work comp and there's no other. Insurance and the whole bit that then we're on it and I'm just like. I guess I don't fully understand either. Like if he's including or excluding himself, I mean he has coverage or he doesn't have coverage and if it's an LLC, they're including themselves or excluding themselves the exact same. What other insurance are you like you referring to? I guess. I guess they're looking at. With a sole proprietor, they're automatically excluded, and I I think their whole issue is they don't want to include anybody. Of being a sole proprietor since by statute they're totally excluded from coverage. And they just I guess they just feel uncomfortable with the whole sole proprietor and the whole bit so. But I mean, just in LLC you have the just I mean sole proprietors have the option to include themselves though. Right. And so does on. So does an LLC. So does a corporation. I mean, whether or not by statute they're automatically included or excluded or whatever based on the state. They still have the option to do the opposite of whatever the normal statute is, no matter what their business type is. You know what I mean? Correct. It doesn't fully make sense to me still. So, but you know if that's what they want to do, then that's what they want to do. So. Well, I I'm just going to tell you I'm owning this one because I I did not pay any. I guess we were having so many system problems. Yeah, I didn't even catch it. I I I didn't even catch it and we were just trying to get these things done so. If he
