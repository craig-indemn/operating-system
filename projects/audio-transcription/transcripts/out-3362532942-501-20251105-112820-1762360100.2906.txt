We have your auto and a travel trailer policy written through my office. I'm calling you today just to do some very simple account review with you. Your auto policy has actually come up for renewal on January 27th with Progressive, and I wanted to make sure that all the information in the system was still up to date for you. And if you want to call me back, I'm in office all week this week Monday through Friday from 9:00 to 5:00. 336-377-9003 is the direct office number. We do genuinely appreciate your business. I've certainly do with Ford's had with you as well. Okay, thanks so much and. Will Thompson.
