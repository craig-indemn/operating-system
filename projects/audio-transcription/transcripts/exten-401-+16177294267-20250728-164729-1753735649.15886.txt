Hi Heather, this is Brooke B. I am returning your call that you returned to me. Yeah. How's it going? I have it's going. You know it's a Monday, so we're making it. I have a question. One of our insureds I believe got their policy with you. I just didn't know if you made a note or if they made you aware that the mother Betty Leak would be driving and I do have the policy number. What is the policy number? Two zero two six zero eight two four one six. Let's see here we got here. This for Danielle Cameron. Yes. Okay. Can we write this policy back and the number of twenty twenty four? What would you got? Yes, that's correct. You are right. It looks like it was the inception date was the seventh of December of twenty four. Yes. Okay. Just so I can go there. Because Lord knows I can't remember her or what the conversation was. I am sure I. I can't remember. Yesterday, what place or who had the policy? Right. God for documents. Yes, you think we used to be state. Very early on my first year. Yeah. Paid a claim because one year it was the worst claim I've ever paid in my life. Having Caroline. All right, one of the guys. I'm gonna get her announcement. We get all the others. Expect it or receive other for Christmas. Cameron needs to keep empty cabin. So what what is what we have going on? Basically, a claimless and our mother was driving it. Yes, a single vehicle accident, and it looks like the mother. According to the police report, the mother was the one driving, and the mother was driving the vehicle by herself. So there is no passengers listed on the police report or anything like that. But they're kind of adamant that the mother was not driving. So just trying to cover all my bases. Right, right. Yeah, I mean, let's see. Did we pull the application? She's not on the app. Right, I mean, did she sign the form saying that she was not in the household. Yeah, I have a copy of the application. I think the only there was like a Frederick something was listed on the driver's third page, but that was it. But Danielle on our end was the only one that's actually listed as a driver on the policy. Her mother was not with her. Yes, according to both of them for four years. Yeah, I mean, if she signed, it was just he said a Frederick was on there. She signed as a household member or regular. I think the Frederick was on the driver's third page, like basically just saying he does not live in the household and is not going to be driving the vehicles. But outside of him, I think that was the only person other than Danielle who was not living. The mother wasn't listed at all, and there was no nothing brought up. Yeah, I just wanted to. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Because I always ask is anybody else is residing in the household. Need to be listed. Yeah. Or not listed if they have their other insurance. Of course, you know they they only need to be listed, but we can provide provide proof of others. So does the mother have other insurance? She does not have other insurance, and I think license is expired for the mother. Oh my god! Are you kidding me? Yeah. I see now. I just pulled up the driver's collision or driver's certification. Yeah, it was just Frederick. Then. Yeah. So yeah, I don't I don't recall having a conversation about her mother, but she's been living with her for four years. That's prior to. Yeah, prior to yeah, and then but if she didn't have a license and now with license are expired, I have no idea. Yeah, I wouldn't be able to tell you. I just can. Yeah. Yeah, it's. The only thing I see is Frederick. She signed off on Frederick, but not our mother. Yeah, that's what I was seeing too. I just wanted to make sure. Like I know you get probably. What did you say, her name? Betty Ann Leak. L E A K. Just doing like a search. Nope, I am not finding her at all. No conversation. Yeah, I am so sorry. Okay. No, it's okay. I just wanted to double check with you. Yeah, I appreciate it. But yeah, we. No one else was involved. Right, that's that is a good thing. Single vehicle accident. I guess it's not going to be like that. What is she here? What is she hit something or like a mailbox or? She just completely ran off the road. So I think just judging by what the police said and what the tow people said, I think like the whole axle is broken,
