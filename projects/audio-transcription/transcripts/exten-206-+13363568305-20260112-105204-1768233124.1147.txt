On a camper, well, let me do this. Let me take the information. Have somebody call you. What is the best number for them to reach you? Is this like a pull behind or? No, a stationary. Okay. Oh, a stationary camper. Okay, where is it going to be located? It's in the in the separate department on the parkway in. Battle Ridge campground. Yep. Okay. All right. What is the best number to reach you? Four zero one nineteen sixteen. That's my cell phone. Gotcha. Four zero one nineteen sixteen. Do you own it now or you getting ready to buy it? I've already bought it. Okay, gotcha. All right. Let me let me send it out and somebody will call you back here probably within the hour. Hopefully. Okay. All right. On that on that other insurance, I got a. I guess it's just like it says it's not a bill and I can go ahead and pay it away for the bill. What should I do on that? That's where I need to look. Yeah, hang on one second and I will. Pull it up and take a look. Hey Jeff. Yes. Why are you in there? I don't know if it makes a difference not, but they still got my wife's name on. She been dead. Six little over six years. Does her name don't need to be taken off of that policy because nobody drives my vehicle because except me. It's on the auto owner's policy, right? Right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, let me. I am getting in there right now. Give me just one second. Kayleen don't drive no more and then Ronald he's got his own vehicle so nobody drives mine except me and Ronald drive the rollbacks but that's all he don't ever drive none of my personal vehicles. Gotcha. And if he did, is matters fifty four years old. You ain't like putting a teenager in. Yeah. All right. Let's see. So you are saying we're still showing your. Yeah. Wife as a driver on here. Okay. Yeah. Ronald. All right, the vehicle you added that was a twenty twenty two Ford F five hundred and fifty. Right, that's correct. Yes. Okay. Yep, and it looks like it generated a bill of one thousand two hundred forty three dollars, seventeen cents. Does that sound about right? I don't know. I don't. Now my shop now one thousand two hundred. You say two one thousand. Yep, one thousand two hundred forty three dollars and seventeen cents. Okay. And it does show that there is not a payment due. We can take that payment. If you want to make it, or you can wait for the bill to come. Either way. Okay. Well, yeah, when I well, I want I want to add this camper so I'll just do it all one time here. Yeah, I just wait for the wait for that bill to come in. If you don't if you don't mind. Okay. All right. So we need to delete the driver and call you back about adding stationary camper. Okay. Yeah. They still got her name on. It makes the insurance any higher. I don't know if it does or not, but I am the only driver except for the like rollbacks. Me and Ronald both drive them, but the personal cars is nobody driving but me. Gotcha. Okay. All right. Let me take a look at it and somebody will give you call back here shortly. Okay. Thank you. All right. Thanks Ronald. Talk to you later. I mean Johnny. Thank you. Appreciate it. Bye bye.
