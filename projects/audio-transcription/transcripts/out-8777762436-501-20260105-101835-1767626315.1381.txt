Get out of here. Thank you for calling Progressive. This is Susan. May I have your first and last name, please? Hi there, Susan. Good morning. My name is Jamie Flippin. I'm an agent here with Alliance Insurance. My agent code is eight four four zero seven. And the policy I gave the system is for Delana Curry. Well, thank you so much. I'm bringing this policy up as we speak. How are you today? I'm doing okay. I need another cup of coffee, but I'm doing well. I hope you are. I am. Thank you. I'm glad. I'm glad. I'm calling to hopefully get Miss Curry out of a headache that she gave herself. She sold. If you look backwards a few days, there's a fourteen excuse me, a Ford Mustang that just got removed on the policy. She sold that vehicle, and she went to the app and deleted the vehicle from the policy herself. And she she just called me and said, "Hey, I did this. Did I do it properly?" And in that conversation I had with her, she still got the tag sitting in her living room. And I said, "Well, unfortunately, you didn't do that properly because the DMV's in the flag fee for having less in coverage." So my question to you this morning would be, can you add this thing back, and and then leave it on the policy until she like could you add this thing back without the breach in the coverage. And then she's going to take the tag back and and then I'll delete it off once that's completed. Absolutely, I mean it's within that thirty day period, so we're going to be good with that. Let me see what coverage she had on it because I'm guessing we probably just want to keep just the liability coverage for now. So it's because I know we're mostly concerned. About that, so let me get in here. And it was January third. Okay, yeah, more than happy to get that on there. Let's do this. And like you said, you'll just go in once she's got everything completed, just delete it at that time. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I will do that. Now I don't know if the state offers this, but I know in my state there is a. Where you can kind of delete yourself for any kind of liability. You can say, "Hey, I sold this vehicle on this date. I'm no longer responsible for like liability coverage on there." That might be a possibility. I know in my state of California I have that, so it is an option if she needs something a little bit quicker. Because I know it takes a little time, especially after a holiday to go to the DMV. So. Just put it on there. So I don't I don't I don't know if ever seen that, but I I told her I would call her back and just talk. Yeah. Whatever. Well and here's here's the thing though I mean if that is something that is available then great we can always go back because we within that thirty day period we can do that otherwise. Sorry. Yeah. Oh no. Sounds like my dog. No, no, no. You're absolutely fine. My dog sounds like a child screaming sometimes and it's just like, oh my gosh, what are you doing? And he does not like it when people let's say go to the. We have I own a townhouse, so they don't. He doesn't like people going there for the mailbox. But if you hear fireworks and everything, he's absolutely fine. He doesn't. So it's kind of funny. I'm like, oh goodness. So and then saw the dog won't pass out, but yeah so but yeah I'm sorry for the instructionist. No, no, no. You're absolutely fine. I will. Yeah, if if you can just add that vehicle back without the breach. I'm going to follow. I'm going to call Miss Curry back here in a moment and just explain. What she's got going on there, and then I'll set myself attached to remove the
