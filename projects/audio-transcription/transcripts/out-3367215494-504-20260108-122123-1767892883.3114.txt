Hello. Hi, this Olivia. This is. Hey, this is Holly with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good. I was just calling to touch base with you. You've got a renewal coming up in your auto policy next month. So I just want to make sure everything was still the same. You got any questions or anything? Um, it is still the same. I do have a question. Um, so. I noticed that like every year it went up, which I know like different things like. I don't know, but um, is there any way that I can like, like is it going to keep going up or? Does that make sense? Yeah, um, oh, the last several years, especially North Carolina has increases. But let's review it and we can look and see what our options are. We got. Let's see. Okay, you Gregory and Tamatha, how you say that? Yes. As the drivers in a 2011 Chevy Cruze. Yes. Okay, full coverage on that. 100 deductible for comprehensive, 500 for collision. And I don't see a lien holder correct. Okay, all righty. Um, so yeah, I can. It does look like it's going up a little bit more this year. Um, I can look and see if we have another option to maybe save you some money. Okay. Do you have a need for a homeowners or renters policy or anything? That would open up some more options for bundle carriers. Uh, not right now, not currently. Okay. All right, I will go ahead and get this shopped for you. There is a couple carriers I can look with that'll just do the auto. Your renewal is February 22nd, so we do have time. So I'll go ahead and get this done, and I'll probably get back with you next week and let you know what I found. Okay, thank you so much. And what was your name again? Holly. Okay, thank you so much, Holly. You're welcome. Have a good day. You too. Okay.
