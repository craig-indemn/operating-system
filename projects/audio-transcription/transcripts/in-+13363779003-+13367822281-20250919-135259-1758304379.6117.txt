Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Yes, I need to pay my. I guess first installment to, for my insurance, auto insurance. I just switched it over with Heather recently. It's supposed to start tomorrow. And I've not got a bill yet, and I want to do that. Okay, with Cincinnati. Yes, it's under Hannah Blake. And is it auto or home or both? It's auto. Okay. And I guess basically the umbrella needs to be paid too. Okay. We can take a look at that as well. Okay, so for the auto, it is. Oh, we're doing semi annual pay. Yeah, it's like a thousand or something. I think. Yeah, a thousand one hundred one ten with seventy nine cents. Yeah. Um, but let me see if we can do card. Yeah, I hope we can do card. Or if I can do card, on mine I'll do it on mine. Um. And if we do card, I might have to call that in. Um. I'm not sure if you can like go in online on your side and. Does they give you the option to pay? Is there a way to do like a one time payment because I'm gonna be honest with you I set up my account last week and signed applications and my grandpa just died last week and I have forgot what I set up my password as. And like my username, everything's like left me. If you can give me some clues for what my username is, I would be glad to go online and pay it. But I am totally clueless as to what I set it up as. Yeah. Um. Okay, let me see. What I can do. Okay. Last week's like a blur. Completely. Yeah. And I'm sorry to hear that your grandpa passed. Because I've tried finding my email. For it, and I have not had much luck. Yeah. Is it just send sendin dot com? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let me see. Oh wait, there's no make a quick payment. Let me see if I can do that. Oh perfect, yeah because the only way I can make a payment through here is if you bring me a check. Um and that's the only way because it would draft out of ours. I guess I've just forgot you drafted your password. Okay. Um. I really don't know what to set this up as. So you can't see my username at all. I can. I can only see just the policy holder, which would be Hannah Blake. Okay, it sent me an email. Okay. Okay, it's going to let me change my password. So I think I'm good. Perfect. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good one. You too. Thanks. Bye. Bye.
