So I was just This year, so so it was not the last week. The date, yes. Oh no. We're here on we're here on Timeshare, so I get you. We're Saturday Saturday. Yeah, I used to live in North Mobile Beach. I was there for the past probably 13 years. I moved down in like 2011 and then I just recently moved back here. Um, but you know I still have family. My dad lives there in Cherry Grove in North Mobile Beach. Um, I have lots of friends, so I may end up just kind of going home and them. Yeah, and just yeah. Um, I would love to go somewhere different. I always you know every year I like to go, a place I've never been before. Right. So. Me too, but I've I've been here once before, but it was many years ago. So this is kind of new. So yeah, it's been I was going to say Hilton Head. That was nice. We had went probably. Let's see, my son maybe like 10 years ago, 10 or 11 years ago. I visited there and I loved it. Yeah, it's real pretty. We're in a Timeshare community, so you know they're very well kept. And yeah, you know it's just four of us and we get together every year. Um, we all our boys were born the same year, the same month, went to the same school, and were in the same classes. It was bizarre. Um, and we just were school moms that kept banging into each other and and then we realized you live across the street from me. You live four blocks away, and you live five minutes from us. So one moves to South Carolina, one moves to Virginia, and the other one is in Clemens. And we all get together one week of the year because all our birthdays are in April as well. So it's it's just pretty funny and we've been yeah we we've been friends over 15 years so. This is our this is our one week and yeah we're trying to enjoy it. That's so nice. Well, I'm not going to keep you any longer then so you need to get off the unenjoy, especially while that weather is beautiful. But I know. Well, thank you so much. I'm going to Clemens. If you're you know you said your friend lives in Clemens, so that's where um dad we have five locations. So we have the one here in Clemens, we have one in Nixon. On the north end near Sands over there, and Pilot Mountain, Mount Airy, and Walnut Cove. So we got several locations this year. We need to go to one. Um, but we usually do everything pretty much by phone nowadays and email. So. Um, but did now did your friend refer you? How did you hear about a lion? One of his friends referred him. One of his clients, we have a small landscape business. And one of his clients was talking to him and they were just going back and forth with everything and they're going through a refinance on their home. And told him that they both knew the favor with Geico, and he told him that he got insurance through another company. Um and you know he suggested that we call because they're Geico is not really. The best insurance or the insurance that is giving you the greatest deal. So um I know that he's looking to go. Um he's had uh Travelers insurance and they're cheaper than Geico. And yeah, we write with Travelers, one of our carriers. All right, good. So I guess um I'll get you everything that I can as quickly as I can. The latest being tomorrow, but I could text it to you later on and you can do it tomorrow. I don't want to. Yeah, I don't want to make you wait, but I will absolutely get everything to you in a text. As a yeah. Okay, and so and just so you know that you are quoting because we do have over 20 carriers. So it takes usually one to two business days for the complete process. Awesome. Yeah. Okay, I'm just going to text you Karen right now and you should get it and just whenever you thought the item tonight is fine or tomorrow. I'm there waiting. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Absolutely. Yes, thanks for calling. All right. Enjoy. Have a great day. I'm going I'm going to the bar before I even hit the beach. I'm stopping at the bar, getting myself a shot. That's what I am catching up with everybody else. Oh. Yeah, that's I have to catch up to the girls. So yes, that's right. One or two shots.
