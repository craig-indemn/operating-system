Hello. Hey Alexis, this is the United Alliance Insurance. So I called SafeCo, they can't stop the draft. They said you know if it's seven days prior to the draft date then they could stop it, but they can't they can't stop it. But she did say, so they'll try to draft it tomorrow. If the funds aren't there, the system waits I think like two days and then it will try to draft it again. Okay. So are you are you thinking that the funds won't be there? Um yeah, it would be there till Wednesday night. Till Wednesday, let's see tomorrow is Tuesday. Well you might actually be okay because if it if the first one gets returned then they try to draft it again in two days. You might be okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I mean I can't promise that, but she did explain that it will try to draft it again. So maybe if it tries again and the funds are there then everything would be okay. Everything okay that makes sense okay thank you. Okay, good job. You have a good day. Um. Thank you as well. Thank you. Bye bye.
