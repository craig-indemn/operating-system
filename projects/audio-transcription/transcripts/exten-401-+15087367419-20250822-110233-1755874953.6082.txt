Thank you for holding. Missy Heather. Hi Heather, my name is Jim Silver. How are you doing? Hey Jim, I'm doing good. How are you? I'm fine. Is a good time to talk. It is yes sir. Yeah, I had a task to call you at eleven. But yes, I'm glad you called. Oh yeah, I wasn't sure if you were going to call or not, and I don't know. I just wanted. No, no, I get you know I just get to work and just busy busy. I remember that it's like I look at the clock. I was like, oh goodness. No, I definitely have especially on a Friday, right? I mean, I. Right, Mondays and Fridays are just yeah, always busy. But yeah, those are seem to be more so Mondays than Fridays. But um, so yeah, let me I'm just pulling up your proposal here, and I'll send you a package. I know we currently have you with AutoOwners. Yes. So yeah, did you have any questions or concerns, or did you? Do you want to stay with AutoOwners? So I guess so. No, go go ahead. Go ahead. It's it's a better um it's it's a better I guess package um it'll save you a little bit um doing comparisons to what you have currently with AutoOwners but it's again totally up to you. Cincinnati is is one of our top carriers, so is AutoOwners. But I have been writing a ton of business with Cincinnati, and as you well know, inflation has caused a lot of premium hikes. You know, everything has been going up significantly lately. Well, not lately, probably the past three to five years. According to you know what location you're at, but um, so Cincinnati with them, I have been seeing not as a big of a increase versus AutoOwners. AutoOwners have been just significantly big increases. So again, totally up to you, guys. How you how you feel? Well, so so actually, I want to ask you that question. So this package you sent me from Cincinnati. So this is so I'd be getting the the auto insurance also from Cincinnati. Yes sir. This is all okay. Yeah. They're only a package carrier. So you know we either have to go with the package with Cincinnati or the I can get a proposal for AutoOwners. And I think we did quote through AutoOwners and it was again their premium. Let me get back and look. I know it was like, gosh, a lot more. So I was always trying to just you know figure out what the best route for you. No, I appreciate that. I mean, I was happy with AutoOwners, and I understand they have a really good reputation. I spent some time looking into them when we first we moved here about a year ago, and so that's when I got our our insurance policy. Yeah, yeah, Heather Johnson had originally wrote your policies, and so we work together. I'm in Clemens, but she's she's in the Mount area, but she kind of floats around now. So got it. But yeah, she she had kind of tell me a little bit about you know writing your policies. So yeah, let's see. I'm trying to get the quotes brought up that we because we quoted it. They're I think all of our carriers that you would be eligible for. This is a it does exceed a million dollars. So we're limited to some carriers. Some carriers won't. Their threshold is like eight hundred thousand or one million. So if you go over one million, we are limited. So Cincinnati and AutoOwners are again our top carriers. Yeah, Cincinnati came in. They rank number one, and then it was actually Liberty Mutual, Safeco. After Cincinnati and then AutoOwners, so yeah, AutoOwners they were coming in at like eighteen hundred. For the premium, just on the home now. Just on the home, okay. Ah, yeah. So you can see it's a pretty different there. Let's see. Yeah, Cincinnati's got really good rate. So, um, yes, I never heard of Cincinnati. Well, I've heard of Cincinnati the city, but I've never heard of the insurance company. Right. So I was, I that's what I wanted to ask you. But it so I mean I looked them up; they're A plus rated, and so. Oh yeah. That seems pretty good. What about in terms of sort of you say they're your top they and AutoOwners or some of your top companies? They also. We write yeah we write the most with them too. It's both claims. They're both good with handling claims. No issues there. I know Cincinnati like I said they're probably a little bit better. I mean they're just I would I would class them in the same ranking though you know And then the new purchase is two forty four Glade View Court, Winston Salem. Correct. Okay, just I'm just kind of going through this just to make sure we have everything correct on here. The purchase date is projected nine sixteen, is that right? Quote and eight. Yeah, I think it might be a little bit later than that, but yes, we can we can use that for now. I don't really know. Okay, all right, and it's pulling up three thousand three hundred seventy eight square feet. Yeah, about right. Okay. Yes. And this is um Jim the secretary online again we we typically write I'm not sure how much Heather went into debt with you when she wrote your other policy but. Again, we write on not a standard HO three form. This is the HO three HO seven twenty one, as an enhanced form. It just has additional and extra added coverages that you wouldn't see on an HO three or if you did it would be like an all the card is like an HO three you want the additional coverages you would have to add those in whereas this form that we write on is included. Um and this is a new construction twenty twenty five two story home. Yes. Okay, and it's got shingle roof. It's shingle roof, right? Architectural shingles. Okay. Um, it's on the concrete slab. Uh, it's on it's a cross base. Oh, it's a cross base. Okay. So we didn't we had slabs in here. All right. Um two car garage attached. Yes. Okay. And what about a porch? I've got an open porch on there. Yes. Okay, and then is there a patio or deck? Yes. Yes. Well. Okay. No, it's a deck. So there's a porch in the front of the house that goes down to a patio. So. There's a covered porch that goes down to a patio. On the back side. Or is that the front lot covered porch? It's the front. Okay. All right. There's actually so there's two covered porches. There's one in the front and the back. There is okay. I'm trying to pull up this tax card and let's see, let's see. And with it being reconstruction, sometimes I don't always have all the details on it, so that's why I want to walk through this to make sure we have enough coverage. Yeah, see it doesn't have a whole lot on here. Quite yet. So there is two. You said two covered porches. One on the front. Well, I don't really know how to describe that. So the the one in the front of the house, yes, definitely a covered porch. You know, a roof extends out from the house and covers the porch. On the back side, there's where the two garages are. There's. It's covered. It's a large. It's more like an entranceway. It's all part of the structure of the house. It's not a separate roof. It's covered by the roof of the house. Gotcha. Yes, yes, it does. I don't really think that's a porch, but. Yeah, kind of like a. Is it a breeze way or something like that? It's actually so. In the back of the house, the garages are separate, so they're actually separated. So they're sort of on each side of the house, and then there's the. Second floor of the house goes over the two garages. Got it. Okay, all right. And there's so that's it. It's just covered by the house. So almost like there's a third garage bay, but it's just not. It's open to a door. Oh yes, okay. Probably not describing that well. It's kind of weird, but. Well, I know, and I'm trying to pull up some pictures of a home online. But like some that they're saying is similar to it because it doesn't really give you. Oh, well, you should be able to find it. The still listed for sale. I should be able to find it like on. Yeah, I see. Yeah, I. They've got drawings, so yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, this is more than the tax card gave us. So this is good right here. Good. All right. It's so hard to see a little bit. So now tell me about the garage. It is attached, right? The garage is attached, but there's like a covering from the garage to the home. No, it's sort of it's hard to describe. So. So it's not like a breeze way then, like from the garage to the home. Okay. No, so between the between the two garages is. It's a blue stone deck that leads to another entrance door. It's Yeah, so that's an additional two hundred two hundred sixty thousand, um on top of the one point forty thousand. And that's in the that that's in the the policy you write normally. Yes, uh huh, yeah, we always put that on there absolutely. Okay, okay. Yeah, and I could make that as high fifty percent. Uh huh, you could, and I can definitely quote it like that if you want me to add the fifty on there. So, and there again, so the the four percent inflation is going to be, it gives you the added peace of mind like if it goes beyond. What did I just say? Two hundred fifty. So it would be like one point three. Let's just say let's just keep it simple round it one point three. Um, that is with the additional twenty five percent right. So say nine months from now, it's actually going to cost you one point six million. Right, that's where you you'll have the four percent inflation guard. And let's let's see what that. What does that do? I mean, so so you know the twenty five percent, I'm covered for one point three million. Let's say it does cost one point six million. The inflation guard does what? It covers that difference. It does. Yes, yes sir. Oh, I see. So I see. So so I mean, again, just imagining right? It's so that nine months in total loss one point three is already in there with the inflation guard. If it costs two point three million dollars, it covers that difference. I'm sorry, reminding again. So so if you so it's the total loss and it's with the twenty five percent, it's already in the policy. I could the replacement cost would be one one point three. But let's take us two million. That inflation guard would be the would make up that difference. Well, no, that it's four percent. That's what I've quoted. Now you can go up to let's see. Eight percent. Yeah, eight percent, but we typically it's a standard we usually do four percent. So it adds four percent to the. But doesn't seem like very much. I guess what I'm saying. Well, yeah, you're right. So it's fifty two thousand at four percent. Is that right? Four percent times fifty or one point thirty at fifty two fifty two thousand more. Yeah. But that increases every year. You know it stays on your policy, so it increases along with your. I mean, it's going to be four percent unless you change it. But say the replacement cost when you get your renewal next year instead of one point forty thousand it goes up to. Um one point three or whatever it is. So it would still be four percent more on top of that. Plus the additional twenty five, but do you um let me just quote it with the additional fifty percent on there. All right, I'm just working through this as we go along. Did you have any other questions? As far as the other protection coverage. Okay. So yes, so I would like to know. So I would like to know how much it would cost to have flood insurance. And it also how much it cost that. I'd like to know how much it would cost to get flood insurance. Oh, okay, yeah. Then typically, um, if if you're not in a flood zone, if it's just a standard, if they usually run around five hundred and eighty dollars for the year. But I can definitely get a quote. I also want to know about earthquake insurance. Now that we can add that on there is an endorsement like I said with the flood. It's a separate policy, but you can certainly add earthquake coverage onto this. It's just an endorsement. I just like to see. I mean, I've really looked. So where I used to live, it was you know not necessarily. I'm pretty risk averse. Is what maybe you can guess like if I'm going to be insured, I want to be insured. So I'd like to see the earthquake and the flood. I'd like to see the policy. I just I guess what I'm saying is that the policies I used to have in Massachusetts were called replacement costs. So they were like, no matter what it costs to replace your house, we're going to pay. And I'm wondering if there are any companies that have a policy like that. Yeah, HE seven twenty ones are that. There is a and mass may I have those forms? It's guaranteed replacement cost. I'm going to send you a breakdown and some literature. Um and this is going to come from Cincinnati too. They have a a chart that kind of shows you the difference in the form. Um and I'll send that to you as soon as we get off here. Yeah, that that would be that would definitely be helpful. I oh absolutely. I had a lady just recently, because Cincinnati wasn't going to write her, um they they wouldn't insure her property because she had like, a major water claim recently and that's why she called me because, her prior carrier was non renewing her because of it, they actually filed under two water claims which hurt her but, and actually only one, but Cincinnati um, they offered you know they said it well if she puts in a water shut off system, um then they would write it so she did, she actually ordered it off the Amazon, and then I can't remember the company that came in and sold it but again very inexpensive, yeah I I actually I just literally was looking up before we got on it it got I mean I could buy and try and do it, but I think I mean I got a plumber come to the house to do a whole bunch of stuff so, oh yeah I just ask him that makes me love buying that you know, right, yeah so yeah just let me know, one quick question for you I don't know that there is but is there any discount for the the the exterior of the home being the cement fiber board as opposed to, wood, um it's figured in the writing it's not really a discount I don't think it's okay, it's figured in the print I mean the replacement cost, okay yeah, so let me make sure I do have that in here, it's cement fiber he said, yeah it's a Hardy H A R D I E the Hardy plane Hardy plane yes, yeah, see what they brought up I thought I'd ask I don't know if there is but, oh no I'm glad you did, see, yeah that's what they quoted it as, well there's there's cement fiber which I think and our clapboard that is yes, and then the clapboard right, yes, clapboard okay, there's different names but yeah I always call it Hardy plane, um I do too but you're right yeah, each carrier is different with their determinations their names so, um, okay anything else that you can think of, two quick questions one was with the umbrella coverage, uh huh, I see I so you have the excess liability and that that amount seems you know what kind of what I expected but then says excess uninsured motorists rejected I'm not sure what that means or, yeah I'm not sure yeah I mean you can, it would just be like on your current auto policy, um you do have uninsured underinsured motorists coverage, right so you have your liability limits, um which I think are two fifty five hundred I had to go back and look but right now I'm in the homeowners and I don't want to mess up, um, you probably have two hundred fifty five hundred thousand for liability bodily injury, and then property damage could be one hundred thousand, or two fifty I'm not sure again, um you may know but what you have currently, is it two fifty five hundred two hundred two fifty, or one hundred, but either way then you'll have then on you'll see below, um that that's your liability limits and then property damage, then you'll also see uninsured underinsured uninsured underinsured motorists coverage, and a lot of times it might be two fifty five hundred as well, it is or it could be one hundred thousand three okay all right so that was the, if you wanted to add that to your umbrella policy your umbrella is going to be if it is if it exceeds the liability limits two fifty five hundred, for bodily injury, um, again the the uninsured underinsured motorists you can apply that we typically don't, most people don't want that but you know that would be if it was, if it was that situation where you had to file the claim under your uninsured motorists or uninsured, and it exceeded the two fifty five hundred then that's your umbrella policy would pick that up as well, but the way we typically write it they don't, they don't really add okay John, no I think that that's fine I I I think I understand that I just I hadn't seen that before okay then the other question is on the start date, um let's say we you know next Monday or Tuesday I get back to you and I say you know yes we want flood or whatever we we do that what can we so I have to pick the start date, soon or can it be sort of closer to the time when I find out when it's going to be done, oh yeah you can so well a flood is a little different, so, and just like now we just a lot of our carriers put us on binding restrictions a moratorium, um when there was a storm out there and it could, potential danger to us with our area, so they will put us on like a binding restriction so I most of them got lifted today but that's the only thing I will say keep in mind this time of year, um with hurricane season you just never know when you know we Right, absolutely. I totally agree. So, you know, I mean, I would do a ten thousand dollars deductible. I think I. Okay. Yeah. I think I just don't think I would. Yeah, I don't think I'd ever file it. I mean, I definitely had things in my house I probably could have filed for in the thirty years I've owned homes. I never had because. Yeah. Right, exactly. That's and that's. I hate to say that, because that's what insurance is for, right? But you just have some people that just file claims for just for I need nothing and I'm like, why do you do that? You know because you're putting. Well, one, if you do get a renewal, your premium is going to increase. Two, sometimes you don't get a renewal. They're like, hey, you filed two claims this past year. We're non renewing you. You know, so it's harder to place coverage somewhere else whenever you've got multiple claims like that. But yeah, I mean, if this is if it's a major loss, absolutely that's what I would definitely use it for. Right. That's all I ever think about insurance for is you know so. Yeah. Let's do the ten thousand dollars deductible to see. And you're also going to send you the forms, the form you're using right so. Yes, and I'm going to send you a breakdown. I'll send you a ton of literature. Cincinnati. I want you to read about the owners. I want you to feel you know comfortable with them. I don't want to move you if you're good with auto owners and. But this is a solid. I mean, this is a solid policy right here. You've got a million dollar every million in coverage. Um, just on the dwelling, um, adding the earthquake coverage, um, right now on the eight seven twenty one the enhanced form. I mean, you're getting a ton of coverage for under a thousand dollars. Cincinnati is is coming in really hot right now, like they have been. So competitive. Well, then that that that sounds good. I mean, honestly, that that's the um. But I mean, that's my goal, right? Have a company that's willing to you know. Give me a good premium if I'm willing to say I'm not going to file for little stuff and. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I want. So. Yeah. All right, and then the auto. Did everything look okay on the auto insurance? It did, and that's so. And obviously, I know that there's certain limits you have certain coverage you have to have in order to get the umbrella, but all of this obviously fits. Right. This is sufficient underlying coverage for the umbrella. Uh huh. Right. Yeah. No, that looks good to me. Okay, and it was a a twenty twenty four silver outback and a twenty twenty three outback thing. Correct. And then it's just you and your wife. There's no no one over the age of fourteen in your household. Correct. Okay. So I have you and Julie listed. Yeah, we have this quote has two fifty five hundred for bodily injury, property damage is a hundred. We need to bump that to two fifty. I think. Did you say you had two fifty on your current policy? For property damage. Yes, property damage says a hundred. Is that all we need? Have to do any form. I mean, you can do two fifty five hundred, two fifty, one hundred. I would say is fine. That's what we would typically write. Yeah, the way cars the cars are so expensive there now, you know they're anywhere from fifty two hundred thousand. So. But yeah, I think you're you're good with two fifty five hundred a hundred for property damage. Okay. And then the uninsured motorist is the same. And uninsured motorist two fifty five hundred. You have rental coverage on there. Um. See, and we've got a hundred dollars deductible for comprehensive. And five hundred for collision. Is that good? So I mean, again, that's one of those things where I I'd be happy to raise the others if that if that lowers my premium reasonably. Yeah, let's see. Well, on the auto, it doesn't do it. I'm not like you just saw on the homeowners. Oh okay. The deductible for comping collision on autos, it doesn't make a huge difference. Um, I can put collision or other than collision up to five hundred if you want to do look at that or a thousand. We can do a thousand for both. Totally up to you. Yeah, a thousand for both. Okay. Again, it's it's um. You know, if you're not going to be filing a a claim, like a lot of people use that comprehensive if
