Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Yes, I'm starting to reach Holly. This is Bob Kano calling. Okay. At the moment, it looks like she is on the phone with another client. I can transfer you over to her voice line. She should get back to you as soon as possible. They said they didn't get you on that. She's going to call me back. That what you said. I can transfer you over to her. Oh transfer. Okay. Thanks. It's noisy here. Sorry. No, you're fine.
