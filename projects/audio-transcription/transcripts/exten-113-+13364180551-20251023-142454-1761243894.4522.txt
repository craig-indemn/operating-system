Thanks for holding this, Gary. Hey Gary, it's Michael Adamson. Hey Michael, how are you? How you doing, Stein? Thank you. You doing okay? I'm trying to make it through the week, my friend. Did you receive that document? Let me check real quick. I don't remember anything coming through on the email today. Well, that's just it. I didn't know how to how to handle it. I just signed it this morning. Let me double check here and see if I can find it. Take me just a minute. No, no problem. No, I'm still showing it as just sent. It has not been transferred back to me. Now let me say this, Michael. Can I just mail it to you and you mail it back to me? Yeah, you can do that. But here's the thing: I um let's see on my sent items, it doesn't show up as a sent item and yet your your your email came through. And what I did was I just I just signed it. Let let me ask you that was going to be my next question. After you sign it, there should be a complete button at the top. Okay, at the top. When you finish signing, just scroll back up to the top and it'll say complete and you click that and that sends it back to us. Okay, let me try that and if you don't get it within the next half hour, so call me back. I'll do it. Very good. Thank you, Gary. Thank you. Bye.
