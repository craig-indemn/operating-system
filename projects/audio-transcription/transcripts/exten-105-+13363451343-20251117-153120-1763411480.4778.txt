Hey, Rich. Hey, Rich. What's that? Yeah, no man, just just phone tag on the on the cabin trail house. If you got. Yeah, my phone don't know its number here. I know it and I I use it because it's it's our agency office number and they want me to call from it instead of my cell phone. Is that the is this the pilot office number? No, it's kind of our main number for the we only have one phone number technically these days it all it all rings to the same place you know. So what what. It's all you know I'm still calling you from my cell phone but it looks like I'm calling you from a different from our landline and it just it just tracks the calls so we know I can know who I'm calling who I'm not calling anyway. A few quick questions are you going to own this one under Lazy Layla? Yeah, but I don't intend to own it long. So so it's got a 22 acres with it, Rich. Yep, yep. I'm gonna chop that house out and sell the house and keep the land. I got you and that's and that's okay and I think for what we're trying to do though is to get the track of the whole parcel covered right. Well, just I mean really all I'm gonna need is replacement value of the house and the building because the land ain't going nowhere. No, no, I understand, but it's it's still right now it's all on kind of one parcel right. So when I'm when I'm insuring it yes the the main thing we're insuring are the structures 100 percent that's correct. But they named insured on the policy needs to. Lazy Layla. However you're going to have it on the deed so if it's Lazy Lazy Layla LLC that's what we'll do. Your is the house just going to be vacant? I mean I'll probably be working on it. I mean I'm gonna probably replace the flooring in it and paint it and then get it on the market. I'm gonna I'm gonna list it some bitch in New York City. Well, blame you some yanks who come there and pay you too much for it maybe. That's fine. That's the whole intent. Well, and that's okay. I mean, I just what I'm you know you're gonna do a minor renovation and then you're gonna put it on the market and that is that's really kind of an unoccupied vacant dwelling and nobody's going to be living in it you know what I mean. That's correct. So so I've just I've got to insure it how I know I can insure it and and that way if if something happens you'll get paid if I if I tell them you're living in it or if I'm telling no I'm not living in it. Yeah, he's gonna put it on an Airbnb and rent it. You know you're not going to do any of that stuff so that's what we'll do. Do you know or do you plan or does it have an alarm system in it? To be honest with you, I don't know, Eric. Well, I just put a system on there. Yeah, well, it just got it. It's one thing if you if you activate it, it's a whole another type of conversation. But I'm gonna put unknown. I mean, if I'm not living in it, I'm gonna probably stick some cameras up there. Not probably I'm going to. Yeah, and that's and that's okay. I would do that for my own peace of mind when I say alarm system. What I mean is like ADT or something like that where somebody breaks in a darn thing it calls calls the cops. And that's probably not. I really don't mean it to steal, but yeah, I know it. That's probably not worth the 50 or 60 bucks a month that you'd have to pay for that to be honest. But it ain't gonna matter that much. Do you have any idea when they put a roof on it? I didn't see it on that document you sent me. I just thought you might know. Let's just call it 10 years ago. Okay, we'll put down. It's in good shape. I remember looking at it. I'll put out 2014. It'll be fine. I didn't see any swimming pool. I didn't see no trampolines. Paying cash. Yep. Okay, no so there's no mortgage there. And it's it's just going to be renovated, but but mostly vacant. All right. Um. How many square feet is that thing, man? Do you remember? There's a main there's a house and a building. Yeah, the house the house looks like it's 2,
