Good morning. This is Heather. How can I help you? Hey, Heather, it's Wiley Fisher. How you doing today? Doing good. How are you? I'm good. Hey, yeah, I saw that, and I apologize. I paid it yesterday on my bill pay, so I hope it shows up today or tomorrow to you guys. Okay, I will keep an eye on it, and we'll just say if it doesn't clear by Thursday, I'll call you back. Okay, let me see if it's um. I can tell you if it's cleared yet today. Yeah, it doesn't look like it's showing on my end, but. Yeah, I don't know how I missed it, but that's not unusual. It happens. No, I don't see where it's. No, now let me um. What if I can check scheduled? Yeah, it says well, it just says I paid. I guess it was yesterday, two sixty eight yesterday. So. Okay, all right. I'll keep an eye on it, and we should be good. But if anything goes wrong, I'll call you back. Cool. I appreciate the call. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good day. You too. No.
