Lance Insurance, Gary. Hey Gary, this is Chad Bickery. How you doing, sir? I am doing good. How are you? Pretty good. She said that you were at lunch. Who said that? The girl up front. Well, I wish that would true. Yeah. Hey, where are you a commercial guy? I am not. I am not. Yeah, that's probably why she's. Yep, I think that's why. Part of the the person that went is at lunch probably is. Who specifically were you looking for, Chad? I don't need anybody specific. I just need somebody to send her certificate of insurance to a builder. Okay. Who do we need to send it to? It's basically my workers' comp has expired. Uh huh. And the new policy originated, I believe, the first of September. Okay. And the I've got an email from the secretary requesting. And I can send that to you that would have all the information on it. Can you send it to that support email for us? And then we can direct it over to the commercial people because I don't have. What's the what's the what's the support? It's the email is support at myallianceinsurance dot com. And send that send that through there and then it will automatically go in the system and I'll be on lookout for it and I'll direct it over to the commercial people at that point. Okay, sounds good. I'll send it right now. Yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you, buddy.
