It's a great afternoon, licensees. This is Jamie. Hi, this is Robert. I think I just got a transferred to you for support. I am hoping. Yeah, yeah. Hi there, Robert. My name's Jamie. How can I help you? Hi. So I got a new issue. So. Yesterday I got hit with an attempt to double charge my insurance payments. I know my mortgage company had argued my insurance at the beginning of the month, and I think they said the check date on the nineteenth, but then yesterday I just got hit with the exact same amount on my personal account. Oh boy, okay. That's frustrating. Let me let me check this. Yeah, that's like it's like. Why did you double charge me? Yeah, my goodness. Well, I hope that's not the case, but I can certainly figure it out for you. Try to anyway. First thing first, I just want to make sure I am looking at good information. I got Robert Blair five four one seven, extra drive in Walkertown, North Carolina. That's that's you. Yes, sir. Okay. Yes. I do see your homeowner's policy. Give me one moment here while I get this thing over. Okay. Okay, and okay. So let me write my hair on this here, Robert. Do you have a mortgage on the home? Historically, has your mortgage paid the insurance? Or do you pay that out every year? The mortgage it's it's worked into my escrow account. Okay, so the mortgage paid my insurance. Okay. Oh, and they said they paid. I mean, they said after speaking to them this morning, they said they have the the receipt that was set for the check that was sent already this year on November fourth. They said the renewal check for I think they said sixteen hundred and seventy one dollars. Yep. Sixteen seventy one. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Um. And then you were showing what on your checking account because I do have. So yesterday. I have your checking account information in the system as well. Looks like nine five six eight is the actual checking account number that it ends in. Well, yes, well, and that's that's why I was wondering why then yesterday I I got hit with an electronic transfer request. For the sixteen seventy one, was sixteen seventy and some change, but like that's that's why I was wondering why if if the mortgage had already paid it, why did we have it set up internally to automatically pull it? Well, it it certainly shouldn't be. It should be one or the other, and most people out there, myself included, I am a homeowner. My mortgage is set up the exact same way. The bank requires that they pay my yearly insurance premium. There are people out there. Make sure your house is insured. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, they want their money protected one way or the other. So, um, and most people are like that, but it does show me. I guess the confusing part that I am looking at here. Is it looks like your see six three three one. And two zero three one. Yeah, so your. So two zero three one is your auto policy. What is going on with this thing? It's slightly confusing on my side. It looks like the home and the auto. Are on the same billing page here, but it does show Freedom Mortgage Corp. See. Oh, that's the one. Is current. Why was this mortgage? I put a stop payment on my bank side of it because I was like, I don't know what this is. So I was like, let me talk to somebody before they, I mess everything up. Yeah, um, it. Let's see. Bear with me one second. Let me pick up some math. Yeah. Two eight thirty five. Where does that come from? I can't see. Well, I can't see. I might need to just call Travelers and have them pull this apart on the phone with me because when I am looking at your billing page, it shows me. That okay, here is what it shows me. It shows me that the homeowner's policy is paid with a zero balance. It says Freedom Mortgage Corp on there, and then the next line down. I see your auto policy. Policy two zero. Yeah, so the auto policy, and it shows last payment sixteen seventy one. And then it also shows me upcoming on. Twelve two, it shows me seven hundred ninety one dollars. It's still double that. So I guess my question to you before I call Travelers to get clarity for you. Do you normally pay your auto insurance in two payments, or do you only pay it in full? I paid in full, and I think that that new rate is what my agent was able to negotiate or get get for me this year because I paid in full last year. And so in December, my annual policy is
