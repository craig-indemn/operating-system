Thank you for holding this, Gary. Hey Gary, Wayne Mickey, how are you? Hello, Winston. How are you? I'm doing well. Hope you are. I am. Thank you. I just, well, I tried to go a long to pay this premium, and I couldn't get on there. So I went ahead and called them. And when I called them, they're showing a different payoff than what the proposal was. And I'm just curious as to which one did which one did you try to pay. The home auto. Home auto and the umbrella. Okay, hold on. The one I have says. Go ahead. You got a proposal of twenty nine eighteen fifty three, and they had it as three thousand oh eight eighty five. Okay, let me let me just double check on that and call you back and see what's going on with it. I don't have it pulled up right here in front of me, but I could get it here just a few minutes if I can call you back in about ten minutes. Big late. Okay. You got my home. Yes, I do. Alright, thank you. Uh huh.
