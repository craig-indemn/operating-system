Let us Heather. Heather is this Linda Redwine, I was calling you, calling you back again about this insurance thing. Yeah, I missed you yesterday. I had to leave, I had an event with the Chamber of Commerce last night and so I left a little bit early. And I think you called after right after I left. Okay, well, just tell me right quick about the one that you suggested and. Let's see if we can get it. Yes, let me get you pulled up here. I just resent all the proposals. Did you have a chance to look at the ones I sent yesterday? I don't know when you did it. I saw one. I think yeah yesterday yes. So Cincinnati is, if you go with them, it's going to be packaged just like your SafeCo policy is. I think you have home and auto with SafeCo. This would keep it packaged. Let's see. Let me get my calculator out because you pay monthly for both, right? Yes. Yeah and I want to make sure you know we're saving you. I think the auto was the one that was. Just about similar to what you have that's already in premium. But the homeowners look like we could. Yeah, the homeowners we could save you for sure. The auto is right around the same amount. I want to say. Okay, just make sure how much was your. What was your renewal? Do you know what your renewal was going up to for the auto? Okay, let me see. I think the reason Linda the auto is so much higher is it was an at fault accident. The recent accident. There was a recent accident. I had an accident. Let me see. I haven't. You haven't years. You haven't received one. Let's see. It is. It's pretty expensive. I'm not sure why they are charging you so much, but every. It's eighty two dollars or something a month. Okay. Okay, here it is. Eighty two times twelve is. Yeah. Nine eighty four. Yes, so where that proposal with Cincinnati is going to be way too high. The only other option, Linda, is to split it up and go with Northwest Farmers for the homeowners. And then the auto we would place it with Progressive, and that's the one. Progressive is about the same as what you are currently paying. Okay, and how much would the homeowners pay? Do you pay it monthly too? Yeah, it's one fourteen. One fourteen forty two around there every month for the home. Okay. Yeah, that's the one I just sent you this morning. I was waiting to get that last one back. So it is nine eighty five for the year. Divide that by twelve. It's eighty two dollars. So that's the one we could save you. Yeah, we could definitely save you money on that one. Like I said, the auto was where I was struggling at. It was just coming back high for some reason. I was thinking it was an accident, but you said you have not. I hardly ever even drive. Yeah, I don't know why it was so. I don't know. Why it's coming back high with some carriers, but anyway, Progressive was the one that was the best, the closest to what you have. Already in premium. Yeah. Well, both of those sound good. If you want to go ahead and okay. Take care of those. That would be. Absolutely. Yes, do you want this to start today or tomorrow? I think we've quoted it for the 20th or the 20. I know the other day we talked though you said it would actually do nail your auto so. Yeah, I just we can begin them as soon as possible if you need to, hun. Yeah, I just pay the. Pay both of them for this month, so. Okay, but you know it starts over on November the seventh. That's when it all started over. But so any day's fine with me. Okay, all right. So what if we go ahead and start them today, Linda? You can cancel both of those policies. Effective today too, and they'll just refund you that money back. If you want to go that route. That's fine. All right, let's get this started then, hun. Now do you you have email? Do you have you ever signed anything electronically through your email? It's very simple. I think so. Okay, you're right. Well, I'll send you the applications. They'll come from me, and you can electronically sign those. If you have any issues, call me back and I can walk you through it. Or you can I can print them off here and you can run by the office and sign them. Whatever works easiest for you, you can just just send them. We'll start with that. Yep, we'll start with that. I just take for you to make
