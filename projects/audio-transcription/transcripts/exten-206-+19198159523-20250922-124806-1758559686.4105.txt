Hello, this Jeff Edmonds, can I help you? Hey Jeff, this is Lib Harris and. Um, I got your name or somebody gave me your number from your company and I'm calling about the insurance that Ken Dval has on the. Spearpoint Properties, his company is called Resurrection, I believe. Yes, yeah, I'm familiar with it. Okay, and he said he. I'm just curious. He said he had insurance on the building, and he said that was required. And we have insurance on the building, so I'm trying to just figure out exactly. Why? What. Okay, you giving me a whole lot there. Hang on one second. Okay, all right, thank you. No, you're fine, you're perfectly fine. Let me get my. Information pulled up on Resurrection. Okay. I'm going to try to get to the declaration page. Okay. We took their coverage out back in March. And give me just a moment to. Find what will show the coverages and what they actually have. Okay. Thank you. Okay, now tell me again your name and. My name is Lib Harris. Okay. And my husband. Okay. H a r r i s s and my husband's name is Tom and the property is Spearpoint Properties LLC. And that's the building and the land that Ken is renting. Okay, what's the name of that property again? Spearpoint. Spearpoint is that st. Spear like an arrow arrowhead. Spearpoint. S p e a r p o i n t. Okay. All right. Now let me go back. It looks like. I need to check on one thing. We we submitted for an endorsement. To add owners of building is named insured. Let me. Okay, back in August, Debbie. Sent an email to us mentioning. That we needed to add Thomas Moore Harris and Elizabeth. Harris. That's that's me. That's you. Yeah. As named insureds. And so let's see, thanks for the info. We'll send to the company for processing. So we sent an endorsement request. Requesting that you two be named now that entity name was not. I don't think that was mentioned. In the request from the insureds to add you as named insureds. But at the time, trying to remember when the policy was written. Was this a triple net lease that? Required or requested that the tenants. Carry the insurance on the building in addition to covering their their own property. Well, we currently I mean we sort of. We currently really have no lease with Ken. It's kind of month to month. We have had lease or he had lease things written up and we probably dropped the ball but. I guess the reason I'm calling is because I asked my insurance company. I said. Ken says he has and he's covering the building and he and my insurance company said well. He really can't cover a piece of property, but he doesn't own. Right. Yep. And so that's a fair that that is an accurate statement. But there are lease agreements that require. You know such as a triple net lease that I mentioned. That. Require that the tenant. Take care of the insurance on the building and in those situations we would. Add the building owner as an additional named insured, which I don't know that that was done. At the time that the policy was written, but it looks like we have circled back behind it and requested that. Um. You and Thomas be named as additional insurance. I mean as additional insureds. Sorry, I'm trying to read. Right. At the same time. Okay. So I think that was the that was the attempt on Debbie and Ken's part. To get you guys' interests protected. Now I don't know I don't know about any sort of agreement that. The two of you would have had the producer on this Joe Jessup. Would have handled those conversations. My role in this would have been to have helped to have helped locate insurance markets that could have written coverage for Ken and Debbie and that's that's kind of what we did. But we do have a coverage limit for the building. Right. It could. Like one point three or something. I saw he sent me just the one page. He probably sent you a copy of his declaration page which shows his. Coverages. Right. Then like I said back in about a month ago and that endorsement is still in process. We sent a request to have you and Thomas. Named as additional insureds. Now we didn't use the entity name that you gave me. Right. Matter of fact, I followed up with our carrier. As part of our process to see if that endorse endorsement had been processed and back on September 4th. I was notified that. Let's see. That endorsement request had to be put back in there processing queue for some reason. There was some delay in processing. But that
