I'm calling my land insurance. My name is Demaryd Cloud and I was calling to make a payment. All right. One second. Is it for your business? I can't hear you. Is it for your business? No, it's for my car insurance. Okay, your personal car insurance. Yes. Give me one second. National General. Give me a second. The payment looks to be one hundred and three dollars and I would call a credit card ending in seven seven zero eight. You want to use it? Yes. Perfect. One second more, and we're almost done. All right. Thank you. The payment was received carefully. I will send you a confirmation via email. Is there anything else I can help you with today? I better be all in. Thank you. Enjoy your day. Thank you for calling us. Thank you. Thank you.
