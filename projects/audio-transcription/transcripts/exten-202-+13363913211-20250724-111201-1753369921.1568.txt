Hold on, I'm going to call them. Just stay on the phone with me that way you ain't got to go back in. Okay. I told him I wanted this back. And then he asked me if I was a customer and I said yes. But it's right beside my dentist. Oh, is it? Yeah. Well, that worked out. Where I have my teeth worked on. Hold on, let me message Karen. GPS trip. Are you there? Yeah, I'm still just trying. Heather didn't answer, so I was trying to see if this came through. Where you located it. I'm in Mount Airy, but I just want to make sure that they got it and they're sending it to me right before you before you leave because Cheryl tried to send me pictures this morning but the the pictures were like kind of chop so I couldn't read the whole letter. So I did get a portion of it. Well. The lady you talk to a lady right? Did you have dark hair or like blondish hair? I talked to a a man. Oh, it might have been Jamie then. Was he real tall with a beard? Yeah. Okay, then we should be good. I'll reach out to um to Jamie and he probably just got to scan it in and send it to me so we'll be good on that okay. Okay.
