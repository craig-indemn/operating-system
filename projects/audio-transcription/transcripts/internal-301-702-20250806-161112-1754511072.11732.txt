Rachel, hey Addison, sorry we're playing phone tag. Okay, I left you a voicemail. Did you get it? It's okay if you didn't. No, no, I didn't. Okay, that's okay. I got in touch with Chub about Patty and Dale Falk, and everything is still okay. The policy is still active and it's set to renew. They had gotten an accord form from Dale in the mail, and so that's why they were thinking he wanted to cancel. An accord form. Yeah, but I don't know. Where he got that accord from. Well, he don't know anything about it. Yeah. You know I because I got thinking you know it come from Chub and I tried you know he's been in here today. And I printed him off a copy of what you had sent me. Yeah. I appreciate you doing that. And his wife I think has dementia or something. He said, "I says you know they're saying that the policy was sent back to him. " And he says, "I know nothing about it. " He said he and I he said he would mention it to her, but so I printed he's going you know come back before the twenty third and pay it because he wants he don't want it canceled. Yeah. So. Well, it's not going to cancel. I can feel that because I told him I says Chub is now mailing the policy out from the office. Yeah. Their company office where in the past with us being broker, going through a broker they sent it to us and then we would mail it out to him. He said you know I've got my insurance with y'all and I says we are the agent we're not the company Chub is the company and I think that might have been what happened but you know. So I guess we just leave it alone. I mean you know because. For them to get an accord out, I mean you know it has to be the policy because I mean you know. Yeah. He wouldn't have access to the accord form. You know. Right. So anyway, I think we just leave it to leave everything alone, and go from and you know I made him a copy of it. You know hopefully they'll send out a deal to him. You know. Yeah. But he'll be in to pay it before the twenty third and I'll I'll make sure you know he also and. I sent sent it to Jeff because he is leasing a metal building partly it's got a cement with collectibles like antiques and collectible items. That he leases it from a Charlotte, York and he's wants an liability insurance on the premises and wants a quote for twenty thousand on the collectibles and antiques that he has in there. And so I sent it to Jeff. I didn't know who to send it to. Because it'll be a commercial account, right? Yeah, Jeff can work on that. That's not my area of expertise, but. Okay, who'd you say, Justin? No Jeff, Jeff will do it. Okay, okay, I sent it to Jeff. So that okay, that's fine. Okay, and I gave him his address and phone number along. Told him to call him and let him know. Yeah. And then go from there. Okay, that sounds good. Yeah, I appreciate your help. Yeah, but yeah, they're good to go. Just tell them not to worry about anything. I confirmed with Chub today that they do want to keep the policy, so we're good. Okay, okay, all right. That sounds good. Thank you. I am sorry we're playing phone tag. Oh no, you are fine. Have a good day. Thanks you too. Bye.
