Hey Jeff. Hello Dina, how's it going? It's going good. It's going good. I hope I didn't mess something up. I just wanted to run it past you so fast. Actually, no, I didn't mess anything up. I just like stopped. I had somebody call in, and he he said he needed to make a payment. And he said he got a text message, and he sounded like he might have been like he was kind of hard to understand. Yes. Should he call? I guess well the problem is is that the number he was calling from it didn't do the pop up in light speed. But he gave me the account number, so I pulled it up in AutoOwners and you know it's canceled pending for a payment. And he said he wanted to change the billing to installments and I told him I'd call him back. Since it's canceled pending, I don't know if you know what we can do with that if it's you know since it's canceled pending. No, I think I'm familiar with it. Let me dig it back up here. People just have a hard time. Following instructions, you know. Yeah. Well the problem is Jeff when he the guy that I talked to. I couldn't understand his name. Yeah. And then when I tried to call him back, I didn't call the number that he had called from. I called the number that was on file. Okay. And then the guy that's on file said nobody should be calling in asking about his policies. Because it wasn't him, I was like, "Oh my god." Oh good lord. Okay. The one that I had worked on today was actually Sun House Hospitality. It's a little bit confusing because there's a couple different entities under Sun House and I'm assuming let me let me give you. What I have here just to see if he was calling about the right one. Did they give you an account number? He did. Okay, it should be. Let's see if we're matching up here. Well, policy number was three five five two four five zero seven. But let me find the account number three. All right, the billing account should have been one zero two six five one three two six. Does it does that pull up the Sun House? It should be for the one that I'm familiar with. Should be Sun House Hospitality. Okay. It's with AutoOwners and it has been approved for a reinstatement. Payment, but now you may be talking about a different one. Because. Well. Let's make sure. Okay. Um. Let me look up the account number because he didn't have a policy number. He just had an account number, so I went directly to. AutoOwners. And then it pulled up Sun House Petroleum. So. Well, he might be calling about another one. Well. Could be completely unrelated. I'm just assuming it's the same one because. I talked with him this afternoon about a cancellation. So. Okay. Well, when I called that number, the the guy said, "Well, you might be talking to so and so." And he put the phone down and then I heard them say, "Yeah, I talked to Jeff this morning." So when he got back on the phone, I just told him, "I was like, I'm just gonna I'm just gonna talk with Jeff and I'm just gonna leave it alone." Okay. So. Yeah, I don't know. I'm just gonna. What account did he give you? He gave me um. Let me look it up in AutoOwners again. I've already. Okay. Let me see here. Because yeah, and I even read it back to him to make sure that was the right account number he gave me. Right. And then it ended up being like when I. Pulled it up in AutoOwners. It said Sun House Petroleum. Okay. But then when I went to Sun House Petroleum and then when I looked up that number. That's the number that I called back and then that guy said that nobody else should be calling on the billing on his policy. So I was like, "Okay." I haven't talked to him in a while. We kind of took these in hopes of. Hitting a few big things and. I'm not sure any of that's going to materialize so. Okay, well I. I'm just gonna leave it alone because when I called to find out about the billing, I didn't make any changes. I was just asking because I was gonna let him know you know if you change it you will lose a big painful amount. Um. You know and wonder it doesn't sound like we're talking about the same. Situation. Did they give you? Did he give you an AutoOwners account number? Yeah, he did. But when I pull it up, the number that he gave me when I pulled up it pulled up Sun House Petroleum
