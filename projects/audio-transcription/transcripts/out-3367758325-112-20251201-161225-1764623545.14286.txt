Hello. Hey, it's Brandi with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Hello, Brandi. I'm sorry, I'm trying to call you a few times, but in the past the 22, the 23, and then the 24 is when they they judge me. I say okay, you know because they used to be a 22nd, and then the 23rd, the 24th, they say, oh my god, then I'm going to judge me, and then they judge me. And then I, I don't know, this is why you call me. Yeah, because you left me a message and I wasn't there that day. I wasn't here last week. Yeah, this this is why. So I call you the 22nd, the 23rd, the 24th. I say, oh my god, no, they don't judge me. You know, I don't like being thrown with the judges that one. Because anyway, I'm going to Florida now, December driving. I don't want to be nobody stop me. Oh no, no, no, you're good. Yeah, see where it come out, but no, you're good. And I would always give it a couple of days after the due date. Yeah, all right. You show up on your end. All right, thank you very much. Yeah, you're welcome. It's already fine. Thank you so much. You call me. You're welcome. All right. Bye.
