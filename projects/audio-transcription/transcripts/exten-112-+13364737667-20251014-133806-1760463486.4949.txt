Thank you for holding. This is Brandi. How can I help you? Hey good afternoon Brandi. This is Roxanne Tohill. Yes. Um. Hey, how are you? I'm well in yourself. Good. Um. So we, Jesse, Jessica is out of the office today, but I wanted to. Help her help you get to a new policy. Um. But I had a few questions because it looks like whenever I pull the tax card, it actually shows your address with another home on the property. Is there two homes on the property? Um. It's 104 Nathan Avenue, Winston Salem. 27107. Is that the correct address? Yes. It's showing. Okay. It's showing that. Um. Let's see. Of course, um, the yellow house that's up Main Street, and then there it looks like there's a white one in the back. That's correct. Yes. Okay. Is anyone living in the house in the back? Yes. Okay. So we would technically have to, um. Insure both homes. Oh okay. How was that? Yeah. I mean, is is that? I mean, I'm guessing that that home like the whole property is in your name, right? That's correct. Yes. Okay. Um. Well, first I want to get your main home insured, and we're looking at NC Grange. Um. And for just your home, we're looking at. 305, 000 to cover the home itself, and then you would have a 1, 000 deductible, but the price on this policy is 1, 412 dollars. Is that the the price? I I don't remember what was the price of the other one. The other one was. 1177. So this one is a little bit more. You are getting. Pretty much the same amount of coverage. For this one as you did on the other policy, it's just a different company and they have different pricing. Main Street is what you had before, and. They're not doing insurance in North Carolina anymore because they price their rates so low that they actually lost money in North Carolina. The reason why they're pulling out of North Carolina, is because they lost money and the reason for that is basically not charging enough for homeowners policies. To keep them. You know. Yeah. Yeah. So. This policy is a little bit more. Well, what did you say was the total? I apologize. I'm trying to write this down. No, you're fine. It's 1, 412 dollars. Okay. And you have a mortgage on your home too. Correct. Yes. Okay. And that is um. I wanted to verify. Give me one second. Let me get. This pulled up. It's a Freedom Mortgage, right? Yes, man. That's correct. Okay. So I mean, I've got. I will have to reach out to underwriting to see about that second home since it is on the same property. I don't know how NC Grange will feel about that. Um. They may you know have you sign the exclusion form for that home, or we might have to put insurance on that one as well. If they do, what would be the price of that? Just because um. You know that house was. Legally separated, and then North Carolina said, "Yeah, no," and then they so that house was grandfathered in to 104. My house. Okay. And when we purchased the house, it was um legally separated in order for me to purchase my house, and then my sister lives there. Um and then within. I want to believe within the year, like the following year. Um, we had got a letter through the through through our mortgage company telling us that. They're like your your tax property value went up like crazy amount and we were like we wonder why and then we realized that 102 didn't exist anymore. So we figured that's what happened. The stage just went ahead and put them back together because there are two dwellings in one property. We figured that's what happened and we never even said anything because you know my sister lives there. It's me in the front, so we just we know we're all family. It's not like. Right. Oh, you know. So on the on the tax card, it is showing, um, you Miguel and. Is it Sonia? Yeah. So is Sonia the one that lives in the other house? Okay. So all three of y'all will have to be on this homeowners policy, and I'm. I'm pretty sure like if that other property is into your mortgage as well. Okay. Thinking that that you're gonna have to have two different policies. So it's gonna mean it's gonna get more expensive. That's what that
