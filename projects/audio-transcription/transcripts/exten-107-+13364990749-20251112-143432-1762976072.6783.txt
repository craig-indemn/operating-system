Hello. I'm Cecilia. Hey Stephen, how are you? I'm good. So, what is going on with the the booking? What bookings page are you trying to delete? What I created. Well, I created it doing thinking I was going to be create the second one and delete the one. For myself, I'm trying to create like a you know scheduler for my. Is this through like a website or what? What are we looking for? Yeah, looking through Microsoft. Okay, you mind if I log in and take a look? No, that's fine, but I am driving right now. Oh, well then I can't log in and take a look. Right. Well, just just give me a call when you get when you get somewhere that you've got a minute. Okay, and then I have a question for you. Would you be able to help us find an email from Christopher's email account? Because we've tried Christopher both and Christopher and I both have tried to look through you know the search feature and the delete deleted and all of that for a reply to an email we sent and we we can't seem to find a reply at all. Do you know when you sent it? Like specifically. Yes, so we sent it September 9th and it was to LightSpeed. Let me see. September 9th, Christopher both and I sent an email. We replied to an email and we sent an email or I specifically sent an email to help helpdesk at LightSpeedVoice dot com helpdesk. But we can't seem to find a reply from them. And it's not in your sent. No, it is in my sent, but I sent it and so did Christopher. But it's not in the deleted saying that we have a reply. I'm not following. So you you found the you found the one that you sent. Yes. But did they did they respond to that? Christopher thinking they did, but again he can't find that email. Right. Um. Do we? I mean, we could we could look, but I mean, we don't have any access inside the mailbox more than what you have in your own mailbox. So, literally searching for you know something like LightSpeed in the in the deleted or inbox or something to see if you know if it's there. Would be about the extent of what we could do because like I said we don't have we don't have access any deeper than what you do to the to the actual emails. You know we could do message traces on them and stuff like that. I mean I could I could particularly knew when the message came in. When their response came in, we could do a message trace on it and see if we could find it that way. But we would be able to see the content. We would only be able to see that a message came through from you know from them to you or Christopher. But we would need to know a date on. We'd need to know a date on that. September 9th. Let's say the the September 9th of 15. Okay. If you can do a trace on reply to Christopher from LightSpeedVoice dot com. Okay. Yeah. Well, I'll I'll go ahead and start the message trace and you give me a shout. Well, I'm extension 100. Just give me a call when when you're free and and I'll see if I can help you with the other. Okay. Okay, I'll do that. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye now.
