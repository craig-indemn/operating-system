We're calling with Heather. How can I help you? Hi, Heather. This is Felicia Dixon. I just want to get a couple of quotes. First, on some full coverage on one car and liability on that other car. Okay. Do we have your other policies? Do you have any policies with us currently? No, man, I don't. Okay. Do you have a? Like do you own your home or do you have any other policies elsewhere that we could quote with the auto? I have National General for just my autos at the moment. Okay. Alright. So. I'm not satisfied with this. Yeah, that's it. I mean, we yeah we would write with National General if you only had auto insurance. I'll miss our carriers are packaging. They're bundling like your home and auto. So is that an option for you? Well, I do. I did want to get a quote on for renters renters insurance. I've been i'm renting to own my home, so I got like five more years before to be completely mine. Gotcha. So I did want to get a quote on that too, but other than that, no. No, okay, yeah, um, I shoot, I don't know, yeah, I don't have a carrier. I can give you a number to call if you want to try them. They're pretty good being competitive with just a standalone auto policy. Because all of our carriers are bundling, and I mean we do have National General and that would be our only go to. You know without the homeowners. Gotcha. But yeah, you can try Access Agency. Their phone number's three three six seven six eight two one zero seven. Two one zero seven. Uh huh. Yeah, she'll probably get. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Have a good one. Bye. Bye. You too.
