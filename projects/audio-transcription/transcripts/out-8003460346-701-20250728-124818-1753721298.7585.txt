Thank you. Auto owners, this is Ellie. Hey Ellie, this is Jeremy Palmer in Alliance Insurance Services. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you doing? I am wonderful. Thank you very much. I wanted to let you know that I was working on a quote, and it was saying something. I guess there had been a wind loss in 2021, and I wanted to verify that. I would be able to present for this client the price. Is that something you can look at? If I give you the what is it the quote key? Is that what you guys always ask before? Yes, but it is it allowing you to issue the policy. Yeah, it just says what it what it states to me on the final screen under summary. It just made a mention about that would all be reviewed by an underwriter for the following reasons that may result in a premium change, the property loss. Report returned claims. So. Okay, I would say as long as the property like the premium, sorry, as long as the loss is listed on the policy and it hasn't been deleted, then the price should be accurate. Okay, so if I click on continue down here at the bottom and it adds like everything is funky dory, then we should be good to go. Yes. Okay. All right. Well, I just had to verify because I did not want to stick my foot in my mouth before I called. Of course. Yeah, I mean we'll still review everything on the back end, but the the premium shouldn't change at all as long as the that one claim is listed. Is it in Auto Owners right now? It is yes, ma'am. Okay. Yep, yep. Then one claim is eligible, so you should be good to go. All right, that is absolutely wonderful. Thank you very much. You're welcome. All right, I hope you have a wonderful day, ma'am. Thank you. I hope you do as well. Thank you. Bye.
