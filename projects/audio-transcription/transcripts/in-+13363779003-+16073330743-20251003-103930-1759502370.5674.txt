Good morning, Alliance Insurance. Hi, this is Michelle Milford. We have insurance with you guys for our camper cars and home. Okay. And we are moving and we recently got a new home up towards the Raleigh area and we're going to be closing on our current home on September thirtieth this next Friday. So I just want to call. I've got some stop dates. I don't know when I should stop them or if I need to call back or how you do that. Okay, let me see here. What have you talked to anybody about your upcoming the new the new policy? What do you mean the new policy? Well, maybe I misheard you wrong. Were you were you going to purchase something new? Yes, yes, we did purchase a new home and I went with a company for all the insurances up there because the rates were better. Oh, okay, so okay, I gotcha. So yeah, so Michelle, let me put you on a brief hold and I can get you over to an agent they can help you out with this. Okay. Okay, thank you. Yeah, hold on just a moment. Okay, thanks.
