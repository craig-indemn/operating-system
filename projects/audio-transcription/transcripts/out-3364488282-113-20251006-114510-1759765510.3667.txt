Hey, how's it going? It's Sam. I can't get to the phone right now, but I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Hey Sam, it's Gary at Alliance Insurance. Just disregard that last message I sent you. I ran a quote with National General with the Volkswagen and the Acura on there with liability only. And the monthly premium is one twelve ninety five. If if you decide to take that, we would need to do it on a bank draft, or you need to pay it in full for the year. If you do the pay in full, it's just that amount times twelve. And if you need to call me back, three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three extension one one three. Thank you.
