Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Well, I think that I think her name's Heather. Yes. Um. Let me see, Heather or Holly. Holly. Yeah, looks like you spoke with Holly. I got the H right. Hey, yeah. Um. Is this about the docu sign maybe? The plot. The docu sign. Yeah, I've got it here. I got it today. Did you complete it? I haven't yet. Okay. Um. Okay, so Holly is actually part time with us, um, and then she does work from nine to one. Or from sorry, eight thirty to one o'clock. Um. So she is done for the day. Um. If you were needing anything, you know, with coverages or anything, but if it's just the docu sign, then I can help you with that. Well, I have a question. I have signed up three times now. Okay. And I gave them up credit number credit card number. And the first time. I can't remember. It didn't it didn't go through. So we had to redo it. And then the next month, they charged me the same amount. And my card was supposed to have been automatic withdrawal. And. So this way, I've got to redo. The two hundred and seventeen dollars and fifty four cents, and I don't think that's right because it wasn't my fault. Okay. Um. Let me take a look at your policy and see if that's the number it's given me. And we'll go from there. So okay, so I'm looking at the case here. So from what I'm understanding from what I'm reading, we mailed out the two documents. So that's what you're looking at right now, correct? Yes, I've got them right here in my hand. Gotcha. So I am here on the policy. We reinstated it. Um. Okay, so looks like on eight thirteen we received a payment for two hundred and seventeen with fifty four. And then you had a twenty five dollar reinstatement fee, so that was already processed on eight thirteen. Then we changed you to auto pay on eight thirteen that same day, so you are currently on auto pay. And. The payment that is due today was ninety six dollars with twenty seven cents. Well, why does this this document have two hundred and seventeen dollars and fifty four cents on it? You already paid that one. Yeah. Yeah, you paid that one on um, eight thirteen like I was saying. I don't understand this. Why does it? Go ahead. There's no two hundred and seventeen dollar payment that you need to do. You already made that payment on the thirteenth, and so now I'm looking at your payment schedule and it's all ninety six dollars with twenty seven cents. And that'll be for the rest of the months that you're paying for. Does that make sense? Oh. Does that make sense? Yes. Okay. Um. Could you mail me a hard copy and I would like a insurance card. Yes, I can mail you the ID card and also your payment schedule that way you can see it. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Was there anything else I can help you with? No, that's all. Okay, sounds good. Have a good one. You too. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.
