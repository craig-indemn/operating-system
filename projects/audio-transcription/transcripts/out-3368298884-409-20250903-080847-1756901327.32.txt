We're using roof age of two thousand seventeen. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. And then. Liability five hundred thousand two thousand med pay. There might be another discount I could put on there. I think. Yeah, double check. What's the name of the insurance? It's Northwest Farmers. They only do homeowners. But they don't do our clients and. They don't bundle. Well, if you give it with our agency, they they give you a discount on your homeowners. I didn't put that discount on there. Yeah, and then until we get your auto insurance here. But. It's telling me I need to. There's two things I need to fix. Let's see. We got. You said no trampoline. Age. Your home was built when now. What's what's my sorry. When when was it built? What year? We're using two thousand seventeen, right? Yeah, that's right again. Okay. All right.

We've been here for since nineteen ninety seven. Black awnings, brick building, one story. We're in the center building. It looks like your square footage is twenty-eight hundred. Twenty-eight hundred. And then. Alright, so the rate you're looking at. Is this isn't even right? So low. I need to add some stuff on here. Thousand seventy. The crazy or what? Yeah, this would be two thousand first year. So good, so good. Um and you said you're escrowing. Bank of America. I just need to. She told me all I needed to do was change the name. I can't. I have to drop. I just um. You don't want that policy anyway. It's too much. So. I'm just writing it. Yeah, what she is saying is it's just the continuity of the coverage, right? So one that How how fast can I send the paperwork to to Bank of America? It should be pretty fast. I should have it today. They take a little while because they issue the policy. You know they they they they'll underwrite it today and then they'll they'll issue it and then I can get a declaration page. Takes just a little bit longer than a normal process, but they'll get it done pretty fast. No, I mean how fast can I send the paperwork? I mean I plan to send it tomorrow morning. You think I can do that? You want to send it today with the insurance. Sure, if I sign it today. Yes, I plan to send it by FedEx. They want me to send other documents by FedEx. And of course, if I can send it together with the with the home the insurance. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna um I'm finishing up my and. And then I'll send it to you in just a minute. My insurance. We're gonna do electronically. We're gonna send it to Mike villem at Gmail. Right. Yes. Can I sign it or on the phone? If I pull it from the phone, right. I have to. Yeah, it's it's just like um.

Check check your spam. It'll say. Northwest farmer. Let's have the wrong email address in there, which I don't think so. Yeah, I have it. So I click under view right. It's a good price though you know what I'm saying. Yeah. They'll probably go up a little bit next year. Because the coverage will go up every year, your coverage will go up. So just. Keep that in mind. If it goes up too crazy, we we will shop it for you. It shouldn't be too bad next year. This year was a big rate increase here. Hoping that doesn't get bad.
