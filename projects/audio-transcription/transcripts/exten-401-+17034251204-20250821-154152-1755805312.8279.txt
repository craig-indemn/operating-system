Thank you for calling. This is Heather. Hi Heather, this is Waquisha calling from Credit Union Mortgage Association better known as Kuma. I have a mutual client who paid out of pocket for her insurance so it wouldn't lapse. However, she did inform me that if we make the payment out of escrow so she can ensure that she will get a refund that's okay too. And I was hoping to get that accomplished. However, we just need a bill in order to a physical bill to do that. Who is the client? Her name is Nicole Baker. Yeah, that's my girl. Yes. All right. Which property is this for? The five zero six West, Make Place. Oh, Make Peace. Pardon, Sanford, North Carolina. Yep. Two seven three three zero. Give me one second. I mean, I know she's already paid in full. So run that by me again. Oh no, we were trying to actually make the payment. For her out of escrow as she has instructed. So that way it'll post on your end as a double payment. You send her the refund which she paid out of pocket for. Yeah. And so you need. I just need a bill. The invoice. Okay. Hold on one second. Um. See. Um. Not really a deal though there they do there's, all different. I mean. See. Do you have an email? Sure, it's W Smith. At C. U. The word mortgage. Dot net. Okay. And I'm sorry, what was your name? Yes, it was spelled W A K I. S like Sam, H like Harry, A like Apple. Waquisha. And that's Waquisha Smith. Yes. Okay. And then for the email just to confirm again, I have W. Smith. S M I T H at C U Mortgage dot net. Yes. So, um, just I know she's already discussed this with you but can you also take her out of escrow? Well, it's kind of bonding with the transfer loan. Um, that we're servicing it's not even transfer it's more or less we're doing business with Civic. Um and unfortunately what we were told is whatever. Status that the loan was currently in before the conversion it has to remain that way. Converting over so. So how long? What what do you mean by that? How for how long for? For this year. Well, so we can't we're not allowed to remove. The status of escrow like unless you know what I mean like it's not Civic is not allowing that for their members. Gotcha. Yeah. Um. You know typically if it was with us then we would be able to. Um sort of. Get permission from their credit union. Oh I gotcha. But this particular institution um does not allow it so. Gotcha. Yeah. I know they just get the money like sooner than. Yeah. And at least to the credit. Yeah yeah yeah I know I'm sorry for this particular member. Yeah and hers like she's with a carrier that they offer like pretty deep discount. Really. Paid in full. Yeah and paid in full doesn't mean getting the payment from the lender right. It does. We pay it yearly. Uh for the year we don't. But that's. But it doesn't. They don't look at it like that because you're still. Like if say if for some reason she foreclosed. Right. I mean you're you're taking the money out throughout the year. Does that make any sense? Like they don't see that as being paid in full because they're making payments to you. It would just be like her making payment. No, so out you know monthly. Well, the thing is with the escrow. I mean we would do most of the time it's a just a yearly depending on the loan. Sometimes monthly. But it's more or less like we're not calculating that until that escrow analysis and divided that by 12 months and that's the taxes and insurance so it's not for. Exactly. Exactly. For the year after. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. So. You know the way they see it, they don't they don't consider that as paid in full. Okay. I don't know. I know. But that's I mean like I know I see what you're saying they don't understand how the escrow works thinking that. They're paying monthly. They're paying monthly into the mortgage as they make their mortgage payment. Exactly. And we're like I tell members you use it it's kind of like looking at it like a savings account like you're putting money in there. Every time you make a mortgage payment, we're just making letting it build and accrue so that we can utilize those funds for their taxes and insurance. Yeah. Yep. But yeah, I think she has a good understanding after
