Tommy, are you talking here? Yes. I'm so sorry. I had somebody on the back line. Okay. So you um you want to give me your routing and account number. Yeah. Okay, go ahead with the routing number. Two five three. One seven seven. Eight three two. Okay, number. Four thousand. Four eight two. Six four two. Three zero. All right, and let me read it back to you. So the routing number is two five three one seven seven eight three two. Right, that's one seven seven. Right, you broke up. Okay, let me read it back to you. Okay. So the routing number is two five three one seven seven eight three two. Yeah. And the account number is four thousand. Four eight two six four two three zero. Correct. All right, and what's the name of the bank? True Line Federal Credit Union. All right, Tommy. I'm gonna pass this along to her. So she um so that's all she needed was the bank account information, right? Yeah, and make sure you tell her to. I know she's going to apply this to my truck, but make sure you tell her to apply to my bike too. My Harley, Harley Davidson. Okay, so apply to truck and. The motorcycle. Are you just making a payment? No, she. What she's going to uh do the. What did you tell me yesterday? I think he told me or she. Um, instead of doing it off my debit card, she's just going to be direct. Um. Where they're going to take out. Okay. Okay. Okay. So are you wanting to be set up on the bank draft? Yes. Okay, so set up on an EFT. Do you want EFT for the auto and the motorcycle? Yes. She said it would save me a little money. So. Okay. Did I talk? I feel like this is familiar. Yeah, you talked. Talked you about it yesterday. Okay. Okay. So um very good. So if you're just wanting to get those set up, I mean I can actually do that for you. I don't I don't have to give that information to her unless she was working on something else for you. So that was it. You can do it. All right, so Tommy, let me let me get your stuff pulled up here. Okay. And Tommy, is your address three eight two two Fritz Street in Winston Salem? Okay. So let's see what it's showing here. Okay, and for the auto policy, do you want to keep that draft date the same for the second? Uh, what. So right now it shows that the draft date is on September the second. So it's the second of each month. Do you want to keep it on that or do you want to change it? Uh. Can get to the uh. Let me see when I get my my. Checkup. I just need to check. Hold on one second. Change it to the if you can. Trying to get everything at one time so that it's not everything's not scattered out. Yeah, I understand. Could you change it instead of the second? Could you change it to? Did you do both of them on the like the thirteenth? Yeah, motorcycle and the truck. This would make it a whole lot easier for me. So change the auto to the thirteenth and the motorcycle. Do the same same date. Yes. Let me look at the motorcycle real fast just to be sure. Okay, because I know it's it's way later than the truck. Okay, so it's due on August eleventh. For twenty seven forty three. So on this one, um. I don't know if I'll have enough time to set you up on if because it takes time for to set up for the bank draft. Um. Do you? Do you well what we can do is we can let this one go ahead and draft on the eleventh with the credit card and then after it drafts I can set you up for. September, the thirteenth. Okay. To draft in the bank account, is that okay to do that? Yeah, that'd be okay. I think what'll happen is if I take it off now and I try to set you up for the bank draft, it won't come out for August and then you'll have a double bill. Okay. That might be better just to leave it alone until that draft comes out or if you wanted to go ahead and manually make the payment today. And then I could still go ahead and set you up today for the September's draft. This works better. Do it the first way. Do it okay. Just let it draft and then after it drafts on the eleventh, I'll just go back in. I can set myself a reminder to go in and get it set up for the thirteenth. So so
