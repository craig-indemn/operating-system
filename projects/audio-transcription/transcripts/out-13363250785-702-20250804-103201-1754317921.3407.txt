He had been having chest pains for about a month and didn't tell nobody. Oh goodness. Did an EKG on Monday and said his heart was really strong and they thought he probably needed a vent. So they went in a week ago Friday. And they did characterization. They went in there 15 minutes and said come back out and said he was going to have to have a triple bypass. Oh my gosh. So they wouldn't let him come home. Right. Go ahead. He's too young to be having all that kind of problems. Yep, they said his arteries were blocked 90 to 99 percent all of them. Oh my gosh.
