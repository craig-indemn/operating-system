Good afternoon. This me with Auto Owners. To get the account or policy number. Hi there, Mary. Uh, billing account number is zero one eight seven six one eight eight one. The name insured is Jocelyn Harris. My name is Jamie. I'm an agent here with Alliance Insurance. My agent code is one five zero three nine four zero zero. And hopefully I have just a really easy question for you. Okay, and how can I help you today? Um, so I just spoke with Miss Harris. Um. She told me that the mortgage information has been satisfied and it was okay to delete it all. So I deleted mortgage information off current term effective today and the renewal. It pulled that money. Um, but then she told me that she couldn't get into access the policy information because she had lost access to her Hotmail account. So um, I went in like I clicked the about button. And then I typed in her new Gmail account joiceh11 at gmail dot com and I put it in there and it's done. But then when I click into like the billing tab, it still shows me the Hotmail account and I just wanted to make sure that I did that properly. Or yeah um no. The insured actually has to log in and change that so she can still use the that same email and the old password to sign in with. If she doesn't remember the password, she can still sign in with that and then do forgot password. Do you know? But you said she doesn't have access to that email anymore. But if she has her password, she can still sign in with that email even though it's not a good email. She would still sign in with that and use the password. Once she's in there, there's a little circle at the top with a with a person in it. She would select that and that go to edit profile and then she can edit her email there. Okay, yeah. Um. So Jocelyn is older. Not not not saying that as an insult. She's she's older. She asked me for help right and um. And she didn't tell me she does not access to the Hotmail account anymore. Should I just tell her to maybe should I give her the billing account and then. Um, tell her to put in because I figured like it. She can still use that email if if she doesn't have access to it. That's fine as long as she can she can still put in that email and then her password. If she doesn't have a password, then that's going to be a problem. She would have to call in and um we just have to verify information and then we can reset the password that way. Um, but if she still has her password the password that she was using before to sign in, she would just sign in with her old email with the Hotmail. The you know what's in there right now and then use the password that she had before and then. Um. Or if she wants you to do it, if she's comfortable giving you the password, then you can sign in with that email and the password. Um and then you would just go to her edit profile and then edit the email that way
