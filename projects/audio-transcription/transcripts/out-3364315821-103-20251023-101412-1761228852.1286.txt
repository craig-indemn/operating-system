Trandale. Hi, this is Kendall at Alliance. May I speak with Christy? This is she. Hey, dear. Hey, Christy. Um, so I was able to call and verify that it is on twelve pay, and I can email you over. The schedule of all the payment dates. The first payment will be November fourteenth, and they're eight hundred twenty one dollars and sixty six cents each. Sounds great. So I'll email that over to you, and they do have it on auto draft for your Wells Fargo account. Yes, that's that's perfectly fine. Okay, perfect. So I will go ahead and email you over this schedule then. Okay, perfect. Thank you so very much. You're welcome. Have a good day. You too. Bye. Thanks. Bye.
