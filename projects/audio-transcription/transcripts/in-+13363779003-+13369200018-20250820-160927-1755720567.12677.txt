Thank you so much for calling Lines Insurance. Good afternoon, sir. Hi there. My name is Minton Sosa Hernandez, and I'm being represented by Blanca Lopez for an audit that you guys been conducting. Actually, the audit was Mrs. Rosa Garcia. The reason why calling is because I spoke with somebody like I would say like two three weeks ago in regards of making a payment plan for this for their come this insurance audit. But I haven't received any answer. Okay, is it a personal policy or is it a business policy? It's a business policy. See, I can find the policy number, and I can give it to you right away. Just bear with me. Okay, the policy number is WWC three six six zero six eight three. It was through Wasco Insurance Company. Give me one second. Yes, sir. Okay, let me get you in contact with one of the agents from the commercial team. Okay, one second. Okay, no problem.
