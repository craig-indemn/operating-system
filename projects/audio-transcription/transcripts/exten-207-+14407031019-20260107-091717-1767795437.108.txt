Sorry for your hole. This is Cody. May help you. Hey Cody, Connie McGurino calling McCarthy Burgess and Wolfe. I'm on the recorded line. I'm a collection for AmTrust Westco, the carrier work hub. I'm trying to find out if you guys still insure this. It's under an individual though. Would you rather have a policy number or a name? The name is fine. Okay, it's three names all in one. It's Andres, A N D R E S. Esquimaldo, E S C A M I L L A. Arilano, A R E L L A N O. There's no DBA. No, I no longer insure them. Bummer. Okay, I don't even know they speak good English or not. Does not either. Okay. I mean I have nine zero three four two six two five four six. Let's see what I have because they have yeah we have that they have two penalty audits. They're both non compliant. No one can well we reached them but we haven't gotten anywhere. This is for the twenty three and twenty four. That's why I reach out to the agent for help. And as far as I know, the our notes say because I inherited this from our office. No English. Do you have any other email but the Esquimaldo Andre three fifty six. That is I have too. Bummer and no other number huh. No man that's the only one. Okay. Well, if he reaches out, I don't know if you're able to put my number somewhere. You could refer him to us or maybe he could find someone that speaks English. But he's going to have issues currently, you know. Yep, I definitely understand and I will let him know. Yeah. Can I give you my number? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, it's four four zero. Seven zero three one zero one nine Connie. Co one and eight extensions four three four one. Okay. All right, I will mark your number off. Since you guys don't insure them no more. All righty, thank you so much. Thank you. Have a great one. Just send you too. Bye.
