Hello. Hey Amy Jeff Edmonds again. Uh huh. Hey, all right. I did a little work on the workers comp for KTS and a couple of things. First thing I did, I went to the North Carolina Secretary of State website and pulled up KTS. And KTS Concrete Services Incorporated, and the only officer that is shown as an officer is Ian. It doesn't show you as an officer. No, I I mean I'm actually I mean I'm 51 percent owner. I don't know why. Well, and that that's different. It could be I think he's like secretary or something. It actually shows him as president. That's the only officer that it shows on the state's Secretary of State website, which kind of is priority. Right, so not not an issue. The only thing that means is is that if we do workers comp for KTS, then he can be excluded as an officer. Okay, you could not be, which is not terrible because your clerical rating class is so very inexpensive. Okay, so saying all that, say this: it looks like that I just plug you guys in through HemTrust one of our carriers. And if I put the information in, you would have to be covered. So if you are the only person covered on this thing, it looks like it'll let me issue it. It's given me a bondable quote of a little bit under a little bit under 300 dollars. Okay. Oh. Which is nothing. Yes. And that would be excluding Ian from coverage. So the the next and the next thing I did, I went in and added coverage for Ian using the grading class. And it gave me a quote covering you and him both annual premium of 2, 364 dollars. Now that one would have to be submitted to underwriting. It's not a guaranteed issue, basically is what that means. It doesn't mean it won't. It just has to be submitted and underwriter approved. But either one of those are decent premium amounts given the coverage that would be afforded. That would that would actually give actual coverage to you and Ian both. And you know you could always show that on a certificate if you're asked to do that. You can show workers comp coverage. Now something to keep in mind: if you do put a workers comp policy in force, it's going to be audited every year. So if you were to by chance pick up a subcontractor without getting a certificate, then their payroll is going to be added to the payroll used to calculate the premium for this. And that's normal. That's not individual to you by any means. That's how workers comp policies work. Yeah, that makes. So. But yeah, I thought both of those quotes were actually pretty good. And like I said, the the the quote covering you and excluding Ian. Looks like it's a bondable policy that would only cost. It's less than 300 dollars is what it is for you. Yeah, I think that's I think that's pretty darn good. So maybe we do that because like I said, you know we would just use his health insurance anyways and not deal with the hassles of workmen's comp. So. So yeah, so I think just doing excluding him and just doing me would be. Okay. A good way to go. Well from from the quote I entered, it looks like it would allow that to happen. So we can do that if you want to go forward. We can go ahead and issue it and do the whole thing. Do you would you want to pay that in full? And if so, I can take checking account information and go ahead and get all that processed and done. So. All right. Yep, I have my checkbook right here somewhere. Okay. Yep. Okay. If you got it, I here's what I need. I need name on the account. Okay. The name on the account is KTS Concrete Services. Okay. All right and routing number. Zero five three one zero zero three zero zero. Okay. What bank is that? Just in case it doesn't tell me. First First Citizens Bank. Okay. And the account number. Zero zero four nine three zero three five one zero two four. All right. Zero zero four nine three zero three five one zero two four. Okay, and let me verify the email address to use. Hang on one second. I've got it pulled up here. All right, I show Amy Han Smith KTS Capital Two Seven at Gmail dot com. Yes. Will that work? Okay. That work. All right. Well, I'm going to go ahead then and exclude David Ian Smith from coverage. And go ahead and get this issued. You'll get emails and I think everything should be sent to you electronically. So that will get you a workers comp coverage in place. Oh wow. Thank you so much. Okay. All right
