What the address of the house to be insured will be 141 Alpine Way. Fancy Gap, Virginia, 24328. Okay, how long have you lived there? I have I've had this house for I think about 17 or 18 years. Okay. But but this is this is this is not my current my primary residence. It's going to be very shortly. We're trying to remodel the house. I live in Charlotte now and I'm up here. By I'm retired. I'm 74 years old and we're up here about half the time. But you know still the house my house in Charlotte is. It's actually Harrisburg, but that's suburb of Charlotte. It's my primary. That's correct. That's correct. It is right now. No, when you say remodel, tell me what else going on in the home. What are you tearing down walls or? No, no, no. We're not remodel. Did I did I say remodel? I have remodelled this house in the last five or well, I guess now it's probably been six years. We complete we added about 800 square feet foot to the house and by adding up you know a couple new rooms and. We complete. We remodel the rest of the house. Okay, all right. So what's the total square footage for heated? The total square okay total square footage is 2732. And that's heated. In an air condition, yes. I meant the as far as the square footage that is all heated square footage like. Yes, yes it is. Yes, it is. No, no, no. Well, now it is. It does include the basement, but the basement's completely finished. Has crown molding in it and it's nice. What is the square footage with not including the basement? It would be somewhere around 2, 000 square feet. Okay. And then you have a full size basement. Have a full size but that's finished and has heating and air conditioning. You know just like the rest of the house. Now some of this. The new part of the basement that I So it's one and a half stories. Yes, I guess so. Yes. The upstairs just has one bedroom and that. And a bathroom, completely full bath yes. Okay. So so with the you got your main level right. The main level of home. Um and then if you go upstairs, is it the same square footage upstairs as it is on the. No, it's not. No, it's not. That the the one and a half. Yes. Okay. But I'm not. I'm you know I really need to get this. I've been aiming at this house appraised and see what they say on this square footage because I mean in my in my estimation I think the basement would be counted as. As total, you know it's probably the whole basement is probably over half out of the ground. And. But you know I have. We include that it's included when we when we run the replacement cost estimator. But it every house I mean you know you got your main level, not counting the basement. Okay, the basement is never counted as total square footage. Heated square footage. Okay. It's included though you know when we're filling out this. It's called a replacement cost estimator. Right. But they're just wanting you know how many stories it's it's one and a half stories you don't count the basement. Right. Okay. And then it'll ask does it have a basement? Yes, is the basement. Um, finished or unfinished or fifty percent you know so we put that in there so we'll put one hundred percent finished for the basement. It is a walkout basement right. It has all these details. Yeah, that's what a walkout basement. So um, but yes, this would be a one and a consider a one and a half story home. Um, you just count the heated square footage. For the the primary level and the upstairs. And then we do but we do include the basement, just not in it in this primary heated square footage. Okay, okay. Yeah. Is there a garage attached to the home? No, there's not. Okay. All right, and you said there's central heat near. Correct. Okay. All right. Do you have any detached structures like a detached garage or? I have a detached what I'll call a utility building. You know where I got lawnmowers and garden you know tools. Okay. For outside. How many acres are you on? I'm not on it. This is about half an acre. Okay. All right. This is more like a a neighborhood. Okay. Okay, is there an HLA? Yes, there is. Okay. Is it a gated community? Um, it depends on what I get. Would you have to have a you know there's a gate there but they don't use the gate. I mean the gates open. I I don't know if you would classify this as a gated community. There's signs that says no no admittance and except you know members or whatever. Okay. Okay, but my wife can hear me and she says it's not wouldn't be considered a gated community then. Okay. But there is a fence there or a gate. Yes, there is. Yes, but it's not. Yes, but it's not
