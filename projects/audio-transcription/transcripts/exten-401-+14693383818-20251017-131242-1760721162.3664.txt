Hey Heather, hey Heather, it's Abby. Hey Den, how are you? Oh good. Hey, what's up? Yeah, I just got off the phone with Triple A roadside assistance, which that was a huge undertaking. So I'm so glad that that's now over with. But I'm looking at my my AAA insurance card because that was going to be my next phone call. And I'm looking here; it says the expiration date is December 17th. I wanted to ask just to keep things simple: is it possible that I just continue out this till December 17th and my auto policy start December 17th? Because I know we were going to try to do the 17th as the with the the payment date. Payment date, yeah. I thought it had to be on the 30th. If it does, no worries. I'll cancel and have a 30th. Then okay, okay, yeah, and then they should, like I said, it would be pro-rated, so they shouldn't draft the whole entire amount next month. Like from the 17th to the 30th is all you should be paying for next month. So it should be the entire amount. From the 17th through the 30th. They're going to pro-rate it if you tell them to cancel on the 30th. Oh, I see what you're saying. Okay, yep, I'm following. Okay, all right. That's what I'll do. Okay, I just didn't know if I was making it more difficult or if there was a easier path. Yeah, no problem. Call me. Yeah, okay, yeah. All right, well, and then like I said, I will follow up with you. I'm not going to let them draft anything until I touch base with you and let you know when that first payment's going to happen. Okay, sounds good. Thank you. Okay, okay, Abby. How are you doing? Bye.
