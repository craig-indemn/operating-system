And we want to try to get some other quotes for you to see if we can place it somewhere else. Okay, can you? Sure. Great. Can you also do that for my car insurance? I want to see if I can get like. That would be wonderful. It would probably be best if we did it that way anyway. You get the better rate when you package everything together. Yeah, but still being escrow the the house. Correct.
