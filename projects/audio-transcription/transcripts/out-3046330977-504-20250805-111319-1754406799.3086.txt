Hey, you've reached Linda. I'm sorry I couldn't get to my phone, but if you leave your name, number, and a brief message, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks, and have a blessed day. Hey Linda, this is Holly at Alliance Insurance. I had a voicemail from you to give you a call back. I think you want to close some changes on your auto policy. So just give us a call back when you can. We'll be happy to help. Three three six three seven seven nine zero zero three. Thanks, bye.
