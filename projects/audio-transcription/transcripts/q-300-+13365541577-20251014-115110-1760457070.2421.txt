Thank you for holding this. Is Heather? How can I help you? Yeah, I was trying to see if I up my if I was up my deductible price if it would lower my my payment plan for every month for the rest of the year. What's my term? Okay, yeah, we can take a look. What's your name? Christopher Minor. And your address. Thirty-four hundred NC eighty-nine Highway East, Walnut Cove, North Carolina two seven zero five two. Thank you. So currently, I have. The twenty fifteen Chevy Cruze listed on here. Looks like you are at five hundred dollars deductibles. So I'm going to be honest. If we go to a thousand, it's not going to make a big difference. But I can quote it for you. Yeah, just see if you can quote it. If I uh, what if if I owe the rest of the month, the rest of the year? What's my term? I can't really afford that. Yeah. A month. So what I was paying before I can I can afford that though but I just can't afford that for four hundred dollars a month. Okay, so a thousand is how far I can go. So I'll go a thousand for comp and collision. And let's see. This is only going to remove forty seven dollars. Oh, it is. But so how much? I mean, what did I pay it down to? Did I three fifty something? It's like three ninety two monthly. I mean, it's that's nothing. Let me see what discounts we can do. So is auto is auto pay even an option? Yeah, I can set auto pay up if it's because I'm. Anything to make it cheap back down to like it where it was because I had auto pay set before and it was like two seventy something. Yeah, so if we do auto pay, it has to be checking and savings. Um. Yeah, this is not making. A real big difference either. Let me look at your billing. Yeah, we're at four hundred nine. They have like two payments. They have two payments due on the same day. No, that should be right though. Yeah, let me call National General and just see what's going on because. I'm not sure where this increase came from. Did we change vehicles? No, it was been. I've had the same vehicle since October last year. Okay, let me call them and then I can reach back out to you. Okay. Something's just off with billing altogether. Okay. Oh yeah, because I know I had a reinstatement fee one month. I paid that reinstatement fee. Yeah, but that's only twenty five dollars. So. Um, originally we were at like two hundred and something. It looks like the reinstatement line. There's just some things that are off on here. I mean, I paid like one something. I paid a hundred and some dollars for the reinstatement to get my insurance back back in. Yeah, that was like one sixty seven sixty. Um. Never since then my billing has been all out of whack. As well. Yeah, so let me reach out and see what we can do, and then I'll give you a call back. Okay. All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you.
