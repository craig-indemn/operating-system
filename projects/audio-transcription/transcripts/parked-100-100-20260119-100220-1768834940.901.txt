Alrighty, so she's gonna take a look at that. Do you don't mind? I'm gonna place you on a brief hold. That way she can get back to me on what she ends up looking at. Is that okay with you? Yeah, that's fine. And quick question for you: Is John O'Dell still with you all? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So then they John and Addison both work together on this, and they're both on your account. Okay, okay, just no, just question. That's fine. Okay, all right. We'll give you one second. Okay, thank you. Alrighty, so unfortunately she wasn't able to get into First Mutual or it wasn't allowing her to pull it up the invoice. Okay. So she's gonna have to call First Mutual and get them to send her the invoice. Okay. Now she just wants she just wanted me to confirm that we have the correct email. We have. Let's see. Cabin two two nine at gmail dot com. That's correct. Alrighty, so she is gonna call them and give or email you that invoice over to that email. That we. Wonderful. Okay. Now I did notice on your little on hold thing it said that you can visit my alliance. Is it my alliance insurance or just my alliance? Can you see it online? I guess on your portal. Um, the my alliance insurance. Yeah, or whatever it was. I didn't. I should have jotted it down when when you have them on hold. You know it plays music and it says, "Did you know that you can access your policy?" Um, and I think it said my alliance. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's what's called glove box. And if you want, I can go in there real quick and see if you guys are verifying on there or not. And if not, I can send you an like an invite for you to join if that interests you. Well, I mean, does it have a copy of the policy or the it wouldn't have a copy of the invoice on it. Is that I guess that was my question. It wouldn't have the invoice on it, but as far as like deck page, and I don't know ID cards and all that. Go in. Well, we don't need that because it's not. Yeah, no, we don't have need to. No, that's fine. Okay. Okay, I just was wondering if it was on that. So okay, so I will be on the lookout for the email. Yep, yep, yep. Alrighty, sounds good. Thank you. Appreciate it. You too. Bye. Bye. Bye bye.
