What's up, Sam? Oh, no much man, just run the house. I hear that. I just emailed you some quotes. If you want to take a look at that with me. All right, so see. Trying, I don't see nothing on my email. Just let me make sure I actually hit send. Hold on a second. I typed out a thing, but then I went back and was looking at the quote. Not it send. Hold on just a second. All right, it should be coming through. Next minute or so. Doing right today, bud. I feel good, man. Can't complain. Try to stay warm. I hear that is fucking cold lately, man. So the quote, best company we came back with was a company we just got appointed with earlier this year. It's called Cincinnati. They're a huge company. They do lots of we do a lot of commercial insurance through them, but they also are really good on. Personal these days, so just kind of a brief overview. Better liability limits, pickup renters coverage, same deductibles. You get rental rental coverage and towing coverage, and altogether for both policies, it's about 400 a month. Okay. Maybe a little bit less than 400. Forty, yeah, right at 400. Basically, with both policies because it's forty twelve. For the year for both policies, so basically that breaks down to right at 400 plus little service fees or whatever they probably have. That's not. I mean, definitely, definitely sounds a lot better than. Yeah, yeah. I mean, this is like night and day from what your progressive policy is because you're going to get. So I had mentioned, you know, we typically do 100, 000, 300, 000 for bodily injury liability and 100, 000 for property damage. Just with the cost of vehicles these days, cost of medical stuff, especially having two young drivers. I mean, I highly recommend having the higher limits. If you wanted 50, 150, we could bump it down, but I wouldn't if I was you to be honest, just in case something ever does happen with one of them. Yeah. There's just too many vehicles on the road that are. 50 to 100, 000 dollars these days. If one of them ever you know totals one or whatever and you only have 50s and obviously then you. Get personally sued for the the rest of the value basically is how that typically works. Yeah, it's it's worth having that, in my opinion, especially having if it was just you. You know it's not as big of a deal, but having two young drivers, I would definitely recommend having the higher liability limits. Gotcha. All right. But again, this is all your option. So if you want to check into what it would be if we bumped it down, then we can do that. If you also wanted us to look at. Having a cheaper compen collision deductible on your vehicle at least maybe not hers but. Then we can definitely look into that too. Well, with the like say knocked it down to a 500 deductible. What's that going to put like? My guess is that it probably adds. If we did 500 on both, I mean if we bumped them down, I would probably recommend doing. Like a hundred compen 500 collision. Me personally, I like having a zero compen deductible or you know 100 at the most. That's for like your your deer, fire, theft, vandalism, animals, hail, wind all that sort of stuff. Basically, it falls under comprehensive. And also like windshields and stuff like that from rocks on the highway and stuff that falls under comp too and. That's the most common one probably, and so for that reason, I like to have a low deductible on comp. Yeah, like if you went to a 100 compen deductible and a 500 collision, my guess is it would add. 20 or 30 dollars a month, maybe at the most. I mean, I'd have to just get it. Quote it up, but it's not going to cost that much more. To have a substantially lower deductible in case of some sort of a purchase, you know what I mean. Yeah, well, I mean, if that's the case, I'll probably go that route. Like, if it's only going, I mean, as long as I'm not paying more than what I'm paying now. I think you know maybe. It's 1391. I mean, I don't think it's going to go up more than. 30, 30 to 40 at
