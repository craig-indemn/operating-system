Hello. Hi Tim, this is Kendall with Alliance. How are you doing this morning? Good. This is who. Kendall with Alliance Insurance. Hey Kendall, how are you this morning? I'm doing good. I just wanted to give you a call. I sent that information over to auto owners and they've already gotten it processed with the DMV. I will say that it can take up to 24 hours for the DMV to process that though. Okay. But it should be done by tomorrow, and you can always give them a call. To confirm it before you go over there. Okay. Hey. We got a. We sent a email last night to. I had a guy. He had an accident. Did you? Did there one in? I think maybe I sent it to Jeff. I don't know. Let me go down here and ask Marcella. But this guy he's requested he was an H two A worker. And he requested that we. We really didn't know what he was wanting, but I know I think he he was. I think he went back to Nicaragua and he's just got him an attorney here. That's going to handle it for him. Okay. So. But there was a question here, that he asked. You might can answer it. I'm headed down here. Start taking him a minute. I was under a shed. They keep y'all busy down there. A little bit. That's not a bad thing though. I don't see anything on your account yet, but if you sent it directly to Jeff, he may not have put it in here yet. Hey Marcella. Kendall, she called said that everything of me was okay. She said, "I get my bags," but on that horse. What's his name? The guy that we we emailed Jeff last night. A. He texted him. He said he would call you this morning. Okay, but she can probably answer for us. Can you read that what he texted and he's asking for? Oh okay. She does the same thing as Ramon. Yeah. You do the same thing as Jeff does, don't you, Kendall? I do. Yes. Okay. You have to be careful what you send people and what you say to them when it comes to insurance because there was an accident and the other guy got hurt. And none of my guys did. Okay. Yeah, you do have to be careful about for sure. And we have an attorney with you guys. Have an attorney that represents me and we may need to just let this attorney handle him. Okay. Because he quit, I really don't like dealing with him. He quit and he said he will go to his. To Nicaragua. Came to Nicaragua and the guys that work for us they told us that he is still here in the US. So he lied to us. So you know, in that way you cannot trust. Well, this is what he wants. He said, "Request. I only request the insurance report to be able to pay for my ticket. The insurance company report is the only thing they ask me for. " Okay. But I definitely I will ask the attorney because you know I think the court day is in November. I don't know what is he going to say. You know we do not know what is he going to say. Right. Oh, he told his attorney. You know in order to. Make it for him better. Maybe he's not, but. You know he told us that he will quit working with us. And he will go back to Nicaragua and he is he didn't in fact he is working here in the US. I don't know where. He is at. Well, I don't. I don't think he's asking for much here. I think he's maybe asking for an accident report. Is that what you think he's asking for? I mean, he's not called us or anything. He texted this. I mean, he should have just picked up the phone. Marcella speaks fluid. He should have picked up the phone and called us and said, "Hey, this is what I need." But you know. Insurance report. I don't know if he means like something dealing with the claim. I don't know. It could mean. Can him being in the accident, he should be able to call to Rocky Mount where he had the accident and get a report himself, shouldn't he? Yes, you mean like the police report. Yes, the police report. Okay. We. All right, what about our insurance? His attorney whenever he found out who our insurance was, should be able to find out all the information of our. Insurance shouldn't it. Yes, so if he's the claimant, then he can call and get that information. All right, what would you do in our situation? But I think we need to do we need to say something back to
