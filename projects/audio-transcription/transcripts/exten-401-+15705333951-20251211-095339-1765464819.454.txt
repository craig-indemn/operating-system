Hey Madison, hello, how are you? Good, how are you doing? I'm good, I'm good. Congratulations. Oh, thank you. Y'all did it. Yes, yes, we did. So very good. So what are you doing selling your motor? Are you getting rid of the motorcycle? Yeah, we're we're gonna so it's just in the shed right now. We usually keep it, store in the shed, but I am pregnant. So oh gosh, double congrats. Wow, thank you. Oh my goodness, need to sell the motorcycle because it's not worth the risk and everything. No, absolutely very smart. Yes, so we're selling it. So I yeah no we're very excited. We just found out the gender the other day. So it's a boy. And when's he due date? When will he be here? June twenty-first. All right. Oh my gosh. Gosh, how we're just moving along, girl. Yes, we are. I probably not surprised with the happen. I know, I'm just excited for y'all. That's great. Yeah, I just closed. Well, I haven't closed, but I did sign a contract on my home. You know, I think I told you guys whenever y'all came in, like I want one like downtown motel, like one of the old. I well, I haven't closed yet. I've closed one. Yes, I have signed this under contract. But I, I'm supposed to close on my birthday, January the twelfth. So it's like happy birthday to me. Yeah, and just wind up girl. I mean, birthday present, but it's probably worth. Yeah, yeah, this is the biggest present I've ever bought. But but yeah, I mean it's it's everything I've I've been wanting. So the location, you know, it's an older home. But there's nothing major. I don't think then inspector we're doing inspection on it next week. But I've been there like three times now. I went again yesterday and did another walk through. But I mean everything looks good. It's it's it's built in sixty five. But the guy it was an older couple that had it. I mean they were their original owners. Yeah, so they had it built and then they passed away. And but of course they did a lot of updates since all of the years I guess so. I mean it's it's move move in ready you know. But I will. I do want to do a couple things, but nothing like really major. Oh that's awesome. That's hey you you say that and then then you just say like oh my gosh I could do that or or I could do that. Awesome project. Well, the guy the guy took yesterday. Um, he's in construction and I was just wanting to get his idea like his thoughts. So I had him go walk through it with me and he was like, "Oh, he was like that wall. I would totally knock that wall out." There's probably a lot more walls. Okay. Yeah. Yes, and I do like that open space you know and so I was like I'm good with that. I that was my thought too whenever I first walked in. I was like, definitely take that wall down. And it's between the living room and the kitchen, so it would. Oh that's great and open. Yeah, that's what I love. That's like my favorite concept. Yeah. And then the kitchen is, you know, he said he would do like it had that lower bar like all them old houses back in the sixties or seventies had like a. Between the kitchen and the dining room, had like this low bar. Yep, we have that. The overhead comes way down. Five and it's like you can sit at it, but you're just like oh like a little. Like it's just like oh my gosh. Oh yeah, so yeah, we were joking about that. I was like, yeah, I feel like I'm coming to the waffle house. Hey, some nice grounds over there. But but that's pretty much. I mean the the bathrooms are updated. That's it's really nothing much major. He had added a sun room on and that's my favorite spot. Oh, oh my god. Yes, so nice. Oh my god. Yeah, and then he also added like um. So like the old homes they were pretty much like a brick ranch and it had like a carport like a one car carport. So he that's what we had. And closed all that and then like you literally my son came yesterday with me too and. He was counting how many cars he was like so both my trucks can fit in here my motorcycle can fit in here and your car so it's. He's waiting now. Who is it's
