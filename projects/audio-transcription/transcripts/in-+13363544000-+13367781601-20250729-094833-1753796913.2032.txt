Good morning, Alliance Insurance. Hi there. This is Jennifer with the Deli Bank here in Columbus. And I'm working. I'm working with a Brian Miller on a home equity line of credit. And I had, I'm 23, send an email to support at myallianceinsurance.com for updated deck pages. Yeah. And I was going to see if because we're doing just an increase on the line, but we're still first mortgagee, lost payee. But it's a new loan number. Is that something I can email at that same one and have it updated? Yeah, what email did you send it to? Um, in my history, it says support at myallianceinsurance.com. Okay, is insurance spelled out? It is. Okay, yeah, that's actually the right email to send it to. We have two Brian Millers. What's the address? Um, he is home. Okay, 3653 Union Hill Road East Bend. I'm sorry. Um, what is the street address again? Street, 3653 Union Hill Road. Okay, so that's Brian A. Miller. Okay, we actually have three Brian's then. Okay. Um. I was just going to check in here just to see if it shows. Yeah, if you want, you can um, so you can send the information to that support at my alliance. Or if you want, you can um send it to me and I'll go ahead and put it in his file and I'll assign it to an agent. Um, to get it updated. Do you want to just send it directly to me? Yeah, that's fine. I just wanted to see if that was still good since it had just been a couple of years almost up to. But what's your email address? I'll forward it to you. So it's my first name Dena D E N A. At myallianceinsurance.com. And you said D E N A at myallianceinsurance.com. Yep. Okay. Sounds good. Um, while it's in that same clause and everything, it's just a different loan number that will have um updated. But but I appreciate your help. I'll send it your way. Okay, very good. Thank you. You have a good day. You too. Bye bye.
