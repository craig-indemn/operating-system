Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. This is Jessica. Can I help you? Hey Jessica, good evening. I just missed your call. Hey, I was calling you because the workers' comp renewal just passed in July twenty seventh, and we need to make a payment of one eighty nine. I just wanted to make sure it was okay for me to draft that from the routing and account number. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, perfect. Um, and then that one I do believe was set back up on monthly. Um, because before it was like I think just two payments. Um, but let me let me see if I have it in here. Okay, yeah, let me see what the future payments are going to be because I do think that would be two months. Um, since it it was supposed to be paid last month, I think they're adding Augustes, but, um, I'll go ahead and get that so it doesn't get canceled and then I'll send you over the monthly amounts. Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much. Thanks. Bye bye.
