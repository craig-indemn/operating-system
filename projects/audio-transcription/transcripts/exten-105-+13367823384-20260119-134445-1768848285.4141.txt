Let's see, Rick. Rick. This is Melissa from up here at HCO. Hey, whatever you want, whatever you want to call me. How's it going today? Well, it's been it's been a busy time in my life. I came out tonight, but the Lord's continuing to bless me, so I don't want to complain. No, can't complain about it. That's just life, isn't it? Everybody gets busy. And I've got these forms. I think they're fine. I do have to, since it's not one of these AIA forms. You know, I got to get a sort of a blessing from Cincinnati, but you know that's not a big deal. They've told me before I can use any form I need. I just need to send them a copy of it. You know when I know what it is, okay. Those forms that I included, and they actually sent instructions on it. And on page two of those, of the second part of the attachment, it specifically states that we are not to vary not one. You know, we've got to use the forms that's in that book and don't vary any at all from it. Yep, I get it. So my question is this: I think everything makes sense to me. Just one or two things. There's two dates on this thing. There's a date of contract and there's a date of execution. Are you asking me to leave both of those blank? Just one of those blank. What do you want me to do there? How do we do the one for ASE Booker T? It wasn't this bond form. You know what I mean. So I don't need. You know what I mean. It was totally different form. So yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right
