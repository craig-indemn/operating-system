Hello. Hey Willet, this is Corbin with Alliance Insurance. How you doing? How are you? I'm good. I'm good. You ready finish that up? I am. Well, I'm not. For some reason, I clicked out of it. Sorry about that. Hang on one second. I don't know why. So I pay today. My policy starts today. Yeah. So you can call Progressive and cancel it if you want today. I see. Sorry, I'm just going to do it one more time. Make sure. If you get anything weird in the mail or like a, just something from the state, just make sure you forward that to me. And let me take care of it because sometimes they'll get a cancellation and then they'll ask that the NV will send you a letter. And you just got to respond to that letter, but we have a direct way going right to their database, so you don't have to worry about it. All right. So one okay, this payment will be one hundred five ninety nine. Is there a certain day you want it drafted that you prefer like a draft date? After this one, after this date, but you can you can choose the one for January whatever. Or it will save at the 18th. The 18th. Whatever day you want, but yeah. You could do. You could do. You know the first through the 31st, whatever day you want. Yeah, I was just calculating. See, when I my bills do that's all. The 21st. Okay. All right. You can make this first payment by card if you want, and then I can set up the the draft after that, or you can just make them both with the draft whatever you prefer. Whatever whatever. Okay, let's let's do the routing and account number. Okay, you ready? I'm ready. Okay, the routing number is two five three. One seven seven eight three two. An account number.

I make medical devices. Oh nice. And I'm a groomer. Like a doggerber. Yeah. Okay. What's your secret around getting around the faces? What's your secret? What's your secret getting the dog's faces? Oh, that'd be pretty easy. The ones I've had, I guess they used to come into a groomer. But I haven't had any problems doing their faces or anything. So you're selective, smart. That's the key. Be selective on who your dogs are. I like it. All right, I'm getting that issued for you. This will be with National General Insurance. They're based out of Winston. They were purchased by Allstate a couple years back, but they're still localized here. They got some. You know pretty much everyone all the law shops around here work with them. They're great. I think you'll be real happy with them. They have a good app you can download. I know Progressive has an app, but National General has an app. It's called Nat Gen. And then you're also going to get. You don't have to download that one, but I recommend it. But there's one you have to download. That's the Dynamic Driver app. So you're going to get an email to e sign, and then at the bottom of the email there'll be some codes that you can use on both your. That's about the driver monitoring your driver. I'm sorry, you didn't want that. I didn't put that on there. I'm right. You're right. Sorry. Forget I said that, but you can put still put that Nat Gen app on your phone, and then if you need an ID card or if you're in an accident, you can take pictures and upload them. It's real convenient. Check your payments. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to print out. I'm going to it's asking for proof of home ownership, but I can get that later. I sent you that canopy connect link, so whenever you get to it, I know. If you can, if you get some time, just make sure you complete that for me. It won't take but 30 seconds. I promise. And then um. So you'll e sign the application. You'll there's a code at the bottom, and then um. What else I was going to do? Oh, I was going to email you your ID cards,
