Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hello, how are you doing? I'm good and you. I'm good, good. My insurance policy expired and I never renewed it and I just I wanted to get that taken care of. Okay, what name is the policy in? Jason Medina. Okay, let's see here. Okay, it was with National General. Yes, I believe so. Okay, well give me one moment and I will get an agent that can help. Okay, thank you, thank you.
