Hello. Hi. Good morning. This is JC with Alliance Insurance. How are you doing today? Fine. How are you? I'm doing well. Thank you so much for asking. I was just calling a follow up. I do see that Joe was in contact with you last month. It looks like your auto policy is due to renew, and we're just calling just to make sure that everything is up to date in the system. And everything, you know, if there is any changes that we have to make, then we'll go ahead and make that. But I'm going to start off with your contact information, Ellen. It looks like we have that number ending in eight three five one. That's a good contact number for you. Yes, of course. Okay. And then we have Ellen C five at gmail dot com. Is that still? That's correct. Perfect. Okay. Yes. And then the address on file. I have three zero five seven Hyde Place Circle in Winston Salem, North Carolina two seven one zero three. That's correct. Perfect. Okay. And then of course we have your auto policy. I'm going to go ahead and get logged into it just to go over the coverages and make sure that like I said everything is up to date and there's no changes that need to be made. Are you having a good morning? Yes. How about you? Good. Yeah, I can't complain. Today is definitely a good morning. At least we have some sunshine. I'm happy for that. It's beaming through, so I'm happy about that. It's been different. JCU. Yeah. That's right. So I've got it pulled up. It looks like your policy is due to renew in February. And let's see the vehicles that we currently have that are insured are the 2012 Nissan Altima. That's it. Okay. And then that is covered with a hundred dollar comprehensive deductible. That comprehensive would be used for any windshield damages replacements or if you were to hit a deer or if a tree were to fall on your vehicle any natural disaster causing any damage to your vehicle you would pay a hundred dollar deductible and then the collision of course is is if you were to strike anything and you needed your vehicle repaired they would be a five hundred dollar deductible and then as well as you do have that rental coverage if anything should happen and your vehicle needs to be in the shop to get fixed and you do have coverage for 30 days for a rental vehicle as well as towing if you are a if you are in need of a tow all you would have to do is make sure to grab that receipt with all your vehicle information and just make sure that it they specify exactly how many miles it was towed from or towed to and then the to and from address and then progressive would reimburse up to a hundred dollars okay all right and then also I wanted to review wanted to make sure that for your vehicle let's see here you weren't using it for any deliveries for any Uber Live no okay perfect no I'm retired I don't yeah yeah we just want to make sure that you like like we said your vehicles are insured correctly and if there was any updates that had to be made so these are just questions that we have to ask and let's see are there any other household members that we have to add to the policy or is it just yourself Ellen it's just me okay perfect and do you have any questions for me are there any discounts that I'm not utilizing like senior citizen discount or good driver discount or any of that stuff that I'm not currently utilizing the only discount that I see you don't you're not enrolled in the snapshot with Progressive I don't I don't see that that's essentially just an app I do believe it does give you a discount actually I did I did use it for a while I don't know what happened to that where I did use it and I don't know if I got a discount because of it or not okay I don't know if I got any discount because of it or not I can't remember okay I do see that you did you enrolled registered the app you did two check ins and then I do have a notice that they haven't heard from you do you have the app downloaded no I don't think so let me take a quick look here and see um um no I don't believe I yeah I don't believe I have the app I guess somehow I must have uninstalled or deleted the app and I don't know why but I don't mind doing that certainly if it would provide some kind of a discount yes okay I can get you more information on it and just double check to see if they're still able to offer the discount and I will be in touch with you okay that's great thank you all right you're welcome Ellen I hope you have a great rest of your day and like I said we'll be in touch my name is JC thank you for your time I appreciate it no thank you have a
