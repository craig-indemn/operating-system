Thank you for patient holding. This is a morning speaker. Yes, this is Pat Littleton, co owner of Mayberry Embroidery. And do you need my policy number anything? Oh, what's the name of your company? You said Mayberry Embroidery in Mount Harry. Okay. All right, we're selling our business. We close on with the new owner on September fifteenth. And it's my understanding I'm paid through November first when I would renew. Since I'm selling, I don't need to renew. So they told me to call you guys and make my cancellation date September fifteenth when we close. Okay, yeah, I can definitely help you out with that, Pat. Looks like yeah, we do have that business owner policy still active. All I need to do is send you over a cancellation form and get that signed. Okay. For them to process that cancellation, that's the best email address for you. Uh, do Pat, one nine two. At MayberryEmbroidery dot com. And then it spell that. No man, we got that on file here. Let me see if I can send that over. Okay. All right, yeah, I'll send that over to you today. Is there anything else that I can help you out with? No, that should do it. Okay. Well, you have a good day. Thanks for giving us a call. Yes, sir. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
