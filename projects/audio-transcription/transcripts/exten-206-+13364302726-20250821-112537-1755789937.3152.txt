Hello, this Jeff, can I help you? Hey Jeff, my name's Eric Leopold. I have a commercial policy. Yeah. Um, I called, I called the other day, about two days ago, and I spoke with a lady that was gonna that was gonna talk with another agent about a question I had. Well, actually, the attorney, an attorney that I do work for, had a question about about the use of GPS tracking. And and if if if we were to be sued, for using the GPS, which we're we're legally authorized to do so. Would that would that insurance policy cover us? And and that that lady that I spoke with, I can't remember her name, but she said she was gonna talk with another agent and get back with me. And I've I've not heard anything back. I need to get I need to get back in touch with this attorney. Okay. In two days now, and. Sure. Uh, help me locate your account. What name would it be under again? Um, the guy at Fortress, it's either under Leopold L E U P O L D. Investigations or the the LLC is I G like Ada George. Young I G Y the number six LLC. Yeah, I think I have found it. All right, let me go in here and. See what was done on your behalf. Okay. Let's see. And I'm I'm just looking through history here, so bear with me just to see what what's in here. All right, it looks like we sent a certificate out for you on the 15th, so it wouldn't be that. Okay, you talk with Gloria. Gloria. Gloria, yep, spoke to client. He has questions regarding coverage for the use of GPS trackers in his investigative work. His attorney asked whether his current commercial package would respond if he were sued for using GPS. I explained. My understanding is the policy provides general liability and property coverage, but does not extend to professional investigative services such as surveillance or GPS tracking. She stated that she advised she would review coverage on the deck and follow up with further guidance. All right, let me do this before I jump in. Let me reach out to Gloria and let her know that you have called and just kind of to just needed to know where she was in her research as far as coverage. And she will reach back out to you. Okay. What? Yeah, I don't I don't I don't I don't do anything that that I'm not authorized by law to do. All that is covered under North Carolina General Statute 74c and the use of trackers as it pertains to private investigations. And so you can go on there and see the the reason I would not be allowed to use them is if they are if there's a domestic violence order. Against the person that I'm tracking by by my client, then I'm not authorized to use it. But this is in a this is in a totally like an insurance case, so it it doesn't have anything to do with domestic violence protective orders. So. Right. Um and again, let me review with Gloria. She's probably further along with this than I am. Obviously, she's she's spoken with you and she she is somewhere at this process. Let me. I understand. Uh, I understand the lawyer and and their company's hesitation because. As you as you know, you you can sue anybody for anything. Doesn't mean you'll win, but it still you know it drags them into litigation that that they don't. They don't necessarily want to go through, you know. Yep, understood. What's the best number to reach you, Eric? Three three six. Okay. Four three zero. Okay. Two seven two six. Two seven two six. Give us a little bit. Uh, it's possible I'm not in the same office as Gloria is. I know Gloria and can access her directly. I just don't know her whereabouts totally. It may be five minutes. It may be a couple hours before we can hook up. Yeah. We will certainly hook up today and she'll reach back out to you. Okay, thank you so much. Because I yeah, I got a lawyer's kind of waiting on me to get back in touch with him. I don't want I do work for him a lot of work. He's out of Raleigh and I don't want to. I don't want to leave him hanging too long, you know. Sure understood. All right, I'll be back in touch. Yep, thank you. Bye bye.
