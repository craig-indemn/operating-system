Hello. Hey, yeah, Justin. This is Brandy with Alliance Insurance. How are you? I'm okay. How are you, Brandy? Good. Um, I was giving you a call regarding the policy that we have for five seven nine five, Gay Street. Yeah. Um, auto owners is wanting to verify that the mortgage is still correct. Um, it looks like they tried to send something to them, the bill, but doesn't look like it got returned back. So we want to make sure that that is correct. Do you have that information? You know what? I don't have. No, I sure don't right now. Sorry. No, no, no, you're fine. What I can do is I can email you, um, what I have on the policy and then just double check that it is correct. And then we'll just have um auto owners resend it again and if it's not correct then I can update it. Um, we just want to make sure that um, that policy gets updated if need be. Um, but I will email you here shortly and then if you have any other questions or have any questions let me know. Okay. Okay. Yeah, thank you for checking with us. I appreciate that. Yeah, no problem. Um, just give me a call or email me back. Okay. Okay, you got it. Thanks. Have a good day. You too. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye.
