Hello. Hey, Miss Taylor, this is Corbin with Alliance Insurance. How are you? Hi, Corbin. I'm well. I hope you are. I can't complain. Hey, so yes, you are calling about the rating. See what I got. Yes. So I got you a good deal on the auto, the home. I'm still, I need to run through it with you. So. I can get you. I can get your auto to. One sixty five a month. And it won't change for six months. At least. That's a bet. That's twelve months. Twelve months. Okay. And that's with. One hundred three hundred limits. I'm not a big fan of your deductibles, but I left them in the way they are. Yeah, I'm not a big fan of them either, but to. Try to pay cheaper. I wanted to. Yeah, I get it. I probably. My computer would work. I probably do the zero comp five hundred collision. That way you got nothing out of pocket for windshields. So say like you did. If I dropped them, zero five hundred and then I add in towing and rental. You don't want to get stuck. Right. And do you drive to work every day? I drive to work. Yeah, I drive to work every day. I drive to work and drive my son to school every day. Is it less than ten miles one way or over ten? It's over ten. Okay. All right. So yeah, well. You got two points. That's that's hurting you a little bit. Once those fall off, you might want to drop those deductibles. Right. So. But if you did if you did drop them now, it would bump up your monthlys to one ninety four. That's still not bad though. So that and that's giving you towing and labor and rental car. So. And then the home, we just got to double check. And make sure. Yeah. I was I was looking to see when your home was built. Sorry about that. In 1995. Okay. You know what? I miss I'm missing a quote from one of my companies that might be good for you. Let's see. Shoot. Let me double check. How much did Ring go bad? Oh, for seven fifty. My mouth wasn't matching. I'm sorry. I'm trying to handle business and check out. I'm sorry, Corbin. Yeah, you're fine. You're fine. So I was just trying to find. I'm waiting on one of my companies, Northwest Farmers, would be good, but. Okay. They didn't quote them. Do you mind if I if you check in with me tomorrow? I should have. I don't mind. Okay, and if I do that auto, I could pay I pay that up front, correct. The one sixty five. Okay. And would you be able to tell me how long I have until those two points two points will come off? I sure can. Okay. Come off on. In 2027, on nine four. Yeah, the conviction date was nine three twenty four. So to be three years from that date, so to be nine four twenty seven. Yeah. Twenty seven. And you said it's three years from when I got the ticket. Conviction date, not the current date. So nine three twenty four was conviction date. Okay. So that. So I'm gonna um. Yeah, check in with me tomorrow. I'll I'll have that other one back whenever you get a moment. Okay. All right. Thank you. Yep. Bye bye now. All right. Bye bye.
