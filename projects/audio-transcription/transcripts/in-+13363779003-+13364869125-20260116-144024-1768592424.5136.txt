Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. If I like to make a payment on my auto insurance. Okay, sure. I can help you out with that. Your policy is not pulling up. What's the phone number associated with your policy? Oh, is it Darlene? Hey, do you? It just popped up. Sorry about that, Darlene. My computer's running a little bit behind. Let's see here. So it's with Progressive, is that right? Yes. Okay. Are you doing okay today? Doing pretty good. How about the sales? I'm doing good, doing good, not bad for Friday. Right. All right, Darlene.
