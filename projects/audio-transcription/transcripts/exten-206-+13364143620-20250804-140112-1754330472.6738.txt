Hello. Hey buddy, sorry. Oh yeah, that's much better. Okay. Um, Katie Co owns Nikasa. Okay. They're selling the restaurant business, but keep an ownership of the building. They're just going to be the landlords. Okay. So he he's middle road package. Um, currently insured with Terry Hawks, but he's asked for the deck page and loss runs for the building. I put what information I had on that first phone call with Chris's the owner. I put what information I had already in there. And typical Chris, it's how fast can you get it? This is about this is about to happen. So I said Chris, we'll do the best we can. When are you closing? As soon as possible within the next seven days, inside of seven days. Okay. Well, what if hypothetically of course? What if we've already closed? You don't have coverage. Me. But I would think if he's got a policy on. So he the ownership's not changing, right? Of the building of the location, but the building. It's becoming tenant occupied instead of owner occupied. It's still a restaurant, right? Right. Right. Okay. So my thinking is, he probably needs. I'm just saying if he's needing something that's already happened, he's probably got it and he just needs to make the policy. Carrier aware that okay, I don't operate myself. You know this is no longer an owner occupied situation. It's becoming a. Tenant occupied restaurant. Somebody else is owning it. So I mean. He's probably got that in place now. We you know we can quote it. It's no big deal to quote it. But as if it's a matter of. Him thinking he doesn't have coverage. I just wonder what what's actually closing the sale of the restaurant business. He's not he's not selling property right. Right, he's keeping the property. Right. I'm with you. Does that make sense what I'm saying? Are you are we? Am I saying what I should be saying there? Yeah yeah it it makes sense, but what we're going to do and advocate for and I even told him you know he could leave it with Terry and just and I told him that hey son I'm gonna give it to you I'm gonna give it to y'all. I'll do business with y'all. Okay. Well that's good I mean yeah but let's let's roll on with it. So basically what it is it's going to be a lesser risk situation with restaurant restaurant exposure. Who's is? Do you know who his carrier is now? It's probably in you probably already put it in there but. I don't know. I don't I don't like that. Hopefully soon because we've asked for, I can set a deck page and loss runs. And then made to him, hey man, you need to get in writing. A contract agreement that they're they're going to carry the necessary insurance and you need to see proof of it and be listed as an additional insured. Yep that's right as the owner of the building. Yeah. All that we're we're right on the button with there. So. Okay. Well take a look take a look at what you got. Sorry to ask you to make it a priority, but if we can get it and he's got to do his part too, right? We need to see some of the documentation we've asked for. But if we can get that done next two or three days, you just don't ever know what Chris. He's the one I think I told you on on Kate's cocktail. He was opening or so he thought that day. And asked us to get insured. No I'm with you. Look he is not the exception. Most people deal with us deal with us this way. That's that's how it is. So no I get it. He told me, and give us a conversation within the next seven days inside of seven days. Okay, that gives us a little bit of time, Chris. Then he asked a hypothetical question. Well, what if the ink started dried on the contract and ownership has changed? That's the way you don't have it like it used to be. Well and you don't ask that question unless that's how it is. So yeah so. All right. Yeah. Yeah I'll get into it. See what we need. Tell me, tell me what you think about that and we'll just roll on and this this header thing on that performance classics or whatever. Yeah yeah we'll we'll let Lawson tell us I'm not going to sweat that one. I kind of felt the same way. We put it in his lap and if he can throw something together fine if he can't you know. Yeah. So be it. So. Okay. All right man. Sounds good. Talk soon. See you. Bye.
