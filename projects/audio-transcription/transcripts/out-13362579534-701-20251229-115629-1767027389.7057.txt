Hey Jeremy. Hey Mister Smith, this is Jeremy. How you doing? All right, sir. How you doing? I'm good, I'm good. So looking back through, I see where I got your message where you had done that second test. And they had requested the last year of medical records. So if Novant has not provided that to them, that's what they're waiting. My last year, my last year of medical records. Yeah, yeah, that's just what they were looking at. Who do they reach out for that on? Who they reach out for that too. Shortly after you had that done. That second test. Yes, sir. That second year test. I don't know if they said too much. I'm personally healthy. They said they had too much protein in it, so I was curious. I got a doctor appointment on Wednesday, so I was just curious that I was going to follow her up on that, but I didn't know they. She didn't say anything to me, but I hadn't talked to her today. Reached out to Novant Health. My doctor, Doctor Wendy, over there at Novant. I'm Robin Hood. That's where I go. And that's my primary. So I. Yeah, it looks like because sometimes with Novant, they take a long they they just take a while for medical records for life insurance companies, and I don't know why. It's just kind of like part of the course. It may take 10 to 14 days, and and I don't know if that's anything you can call to get them to do it a little bit quicker. But I know that I can't, I can't do that. No, I was just curious. You had your hurt. I was just curious. You had your hurt.
