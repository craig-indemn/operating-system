Hello. Hi, this is JC again calling back with Alliance Insurance. So for that that tag for that 2023, since my plan was to go ahead and remove it today, but actually that plate does have to be turned in to the DMV or the license plate agency. To make sure that there isn't a lapse in coverage, so we do need to have that plate turned in before we can remove. The actual vehicle. I know that I spoke to the sales rep. He said that he would have that plate turned in, but if I were you, I'd turn it in yourself and then give us a call to let us know that that exact date of when that plate was turned in. That way we could remove. The vehicle from from your policy. That way there's no issues. If you want them to turn it in, then we just need that receipt just to ensure that it's been turned in, and then we can remove that vehicle. Okay, all right. Okay. I'll I'll take care of it. Okay, and then I did just want to ask about the lease for that. Was I'm sorry, was that 2023 lease? Yes. Okay, is your lease already up? It's up next Tuesday. Next Tuesday. Okay. Perfect. Just wanted to make sure. Okay. That there wasn't going to be any issues there, but since you've already turned it in, we just need to turn in that plate and. Whenever you do so, I can send you a text message and you can just let me know. Hey, I've turned in the plate. Go ahead and remove it for this date. Okay, we'll do it. All right. Well, thank you so much. Have a good one. Uh huh. Thank you. No problem. Bye.
