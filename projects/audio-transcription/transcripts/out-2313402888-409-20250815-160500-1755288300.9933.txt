Hello. Hey, this is Corbin with Alliance Insurance. You called about some homeowners. Do you still need help with that? Yeah, I was inquiring only because of the company I'm with currently Erie Insurance. Yeah. I've been with them for almost two years. Well, actually, since since about May of 23. Have you ever dealt with any insurance companies? I signed an agreement and I. I acquired this. It's like a rider that goes along. It's you know with your regular homeowners insurance that covers everything in your house that's electrical or anything like that. Right. So there's a fee I pay on top of my homeowners. Now I had four incidents that I put in claims on. One was the roof, which you know it blew away like 25 30 my shingles. So that was a no brainer. That happened in February of last year. And of 24, and after that, I've had claim on my hot water tank, which you know blew the bladder or whatever it was and it you know flooded into my garage. My grinder pump, which overflowed into my yard with you know wastewater and soap and all that, and my AC unit, which went out and was not providing any heat during wintertime. And the woman who sold us this policy, rider policy, says, "Oh yeah, you know you'll love it. It's you know really good. It covers everything in your house." And then I get a letter in the mail yesterday saying, "Well, you're up for non renewal because of four claims." Oh. The equipment breakdown coverage. Yeah, I would. Yeah, I know that's going to be hard too to get coverage. That's why I called you because you I was given your number. It was by Progressive. Yeah, she gave me a bunch of different numbers to call. Try. We won't be able to help you, but try a company. If you can go online and look up Orion O R I O N Insurance Agents near me. That's the one you want. I think they can do some claims and still help you. We just don't have them as a carrier. All right, and you know I think I contacted. I talked to a woman named Jill over at another company. Choose. Hold on, I'll tell you what. If you've ever heard of them, Brown Phillips. You ever heard of Brown Phillips? I have not. No. Or Tom Needham Insurance. I heard of Tom. All right, well those those numbers. Tom might be. Tom Tom might be good. You can try him. He's a Greensboro. Yeah, try him. Okay. Sorry about that. Oh no, that's no problem. All right, good luck. Bye now. All right, thank you.
