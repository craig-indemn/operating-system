Let me see if I can get him on here. Is this Rachel? Yes, it is. How are you doing? I'm fine. Hope you are. I'm doing good. Doing good. Well, that's good. All right, let me see what his extension is. Okay, I'm going to transfer you over, Rachel. All right, thank you. Okay, hold on. Good afternoon. This is Jeremy. Jeremy, this is Rachel. Oh, shit. Tracy, I'm sorry. Tracy is in here signing this and he's got a question here. He don't know whether to answer yes or no. Is there document annual mandatory sexual abuse training for employees and it's a new business. Volunteers who have contact with minors they include recognizing the signs of abuse and how to report incidents or accusations of abuse. Let's see. Check on that. Does he put no because I mean it's a brand new business right? Yeah, but he does need to get some type of training in place. In either case, so yes is the answer that they're looking for there is that he's got something in place for training and just make sure that everybody takes some training like that going forward. Okay, hold on. I'm going to let you talk to him. Okay. All right. Hey, hey, Tracy. What I was telling Rachel was the right answer there would be yes that you do have them going through some type of training. Okay. Why not have them do it? Yeah, and that's what I was going to say. And just make sure that they do something and you've got some some type of record that they've had the training in case it was ever audited and. It's it's rare, however, you just don't want to be. Yes, you know just as luck would have it. Yeah, so that is the answer they're looking for there is that yes you've got a program in place. Okay. Yeah, I think we were good on everything else because we did all the background checks for all the volunteers. So that one I think we can actually go through the school system and use their their training for that. But I'll find out. But we'll do something. Okay, sounds good. All right, thank you so much. You got it. Thank you. All right, bye. Bye.
