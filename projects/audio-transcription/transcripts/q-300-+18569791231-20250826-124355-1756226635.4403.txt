Good afternoon, thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hey good afternoon, how are you? Doing good, thank you. How are you? Oh, every day's a holiday. Hey, um, I have a couple. I have a couple policies with you guys. The last name is Scala, that's Estes and Sam, Sears and Charles, I was an Oscar, Eliza Lawrence, is an Apple. First name William. Is it William and Karen? That would be us. Okay, how can I help you? Okay, hey, we picked up on a new car this past weekend, and the endorsement came through the other day. And I'm noticing on the endorsement that we're also including towing labor and a rental car. Um, I don't think we're going to need either of those guys because we have AAA and we have two cars. Okay, yeah, we can we can strip it down. Okay. You want me to take it off as of today or the day you added the car? Oh, you can take it off as of today. That's fine. Okay. All right, I'll go ahead and get that profit for you. Anything else, Liam? No, that's it. So now we're saving seventeen dollars. This is awesome. Listen, you can go to Chick Fil A with that. Okay, so. I don't like Chick Fil A. Oh no. I know I'm really weird. Well, you can get a salad somewhere for seventeen dollars. I think. There you go, cool. Hey, thanks a lot, I appreciate it. You're welcome. Have a good day. You too. Bye bye.
