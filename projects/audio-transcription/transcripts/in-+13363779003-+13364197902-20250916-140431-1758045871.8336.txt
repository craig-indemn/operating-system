Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Yes, ma'am. Can I place? To a service representative. Ah, yeah. What kind of questions? What kind of questions did you have that way I can direct you the right the right way. Well, I have a car insurance policy, with travelers, and I did pay it, but I really can't tell on my. By looking on the website that. My policy was renewed, so I just want to make sure. Okay. Yeah, I can help you with that question. Let's see. Let me just pull up travelers. Ah, so it looks like you went ahead and made that payment of eight hundred and eighty nine with nineteen cents. Is that correct? That is correct. Okay, and that was for the renewal. I believe, but let me double check. Yeah, that's what I thought I was paying, but I don't see anywhere on the website that says that that's what it was for. Oh, ah, so yes, that is for your renewal because last, last term it was seven hundred and twenty three with sixty five, and it went up just a little bit on this one. Okay, but you see that it was for the renewal of the car insurance policy. Yep. Okay, okay. I just want to make sure because like I said, I don't see. Anywhere on the site. Where it was renewed. Yeah, it's just not in effect quite yet because it is. Um, it does renew on the twenty ninth. So on the twenty ninth, that'll be the renewal. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate your help. You're welcome. You have a good one. You too. Bye bye. Bye bye.
