Good morning. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hey, I was returning a call from Ashley about my husband's insurance policy. Yes, this is her. Hey. Hi. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good. I think I spoke to you. I don't remember when it was for that auto payment. Yes. Yeah. Yes, you did. And. And then do you know what happened after that? Yes, so actually, who was it, John? John O'Dell. He emailed me. Yes. And he was like, you know, like a small hiccup. That you seen the charge from auto owners and then you kind of panic and cancel the draft. And. Yeah. I gave him the phone number. Yeah. Can you hear me? I'm sorry. No, yeah, you're fine. So yeah, I gave him the phone number and hopefully y'all got everything worked out on that. Did y'all? Well, that's I was calling to see if maybe I could just the lady that I talked to, and I mean I get it, but. He was like, "I can't give you information about this account—not your account—and it's. When that happens with us, it's just it's frankly it's annoying because like I manage all the business and all the accounts and all the things and he like works the farm so he. Have no idea what's going. I mean, he knows what's going on, but he's not like he's not able to call and I'm not. You know what I mean? Like I'm the one. I'm on. I'm managing it. It's not my account, but I mean I set the whole account up with John. So anyway, she. Was like I can't tell you anything other than you did put a stop payment on that and I was like yes and I said but I would like to reinstitute the payment like you can run it again because I. Recognized what I did and I called the bank and they. Like took it off and so it should be good to go. Well, she told me it was it was good to go and so. But the problem is, I have been keeping an eye on it and I don't see any auto. Like there hasn't been another auto policy charge go through, and so I'm worried. That like it didn't go through. I just wanted to call you and talk to like an actual person. See what was going on and see if you could just if we could run it again. If you you know you still have my stuff, if we could just make sure in fact it. It you know. Yeah. It's like I just want to make sure it's going to go through. You've got my payment and we can just move on from it. I guess. Right. Okay. Right. Um. So let me take a look at it. Let me see. And what policy was this for again? Disability. Disability. I'm sorry you cut out. Can you hear me? Yeah, can you hear me? Uh, just a little bit. I can hear you just a little bit. If you want, I can give you a call back. Hold on, hold on. Okay. Can you hear me? Yes, no, I can. Okay. Um. It's just country life living. We live out here. Is terrible. Um. But anyway, it's for his disability. Policy. Okay. Let me see. Okay, so the amount due right now is one fifteen with fifty three cents. Okay. Okay, now let me see if I'm okay. So I am able to make it. Are we going to do a a credit card or are we using routing an account? Well, I wanted you guys. I gave you the routing an account right just to do. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you did. Right, like I gave I did the docu sign and I sent in paperwork via mail for y'all just to debit or whatever. Automatic. Right. Yep. Yep. Okay. Get in the routing and account numbers now.
