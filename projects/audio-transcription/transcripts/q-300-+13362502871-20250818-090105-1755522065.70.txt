Okay, I have got I have traded in my a Jeep. And I got I got a Nissan Pathfinder. Okay. Um. Did you transfer the plates? Yes. Okay. And when did you purchase the new vehicle? Um Friday. Alright, so eight fifteen. We didn't get out there till late. It was like nine o'clock or something. Yeah, no worries. I know sometimes yeah it happens that way purchasing a car and it runs so late. Yeah. Okay, so we transfer the plates. And it looks like currently you. Did you want to add the Nissan with the same coverage that you had the Jeep? Right, I'm just basically trading in a car. All right, sounds good. Um, what's your VIN number? Okay. Yeah, um, five N as in Nevin. One D as in Drive. R three B. It looks like an eight. It's a B. Okay. B one S is in Sam. C two seven eight eight zero two. And you said T is in Tango. Two after the S. Okay, S C is in Cat. Okay, thank you. I'm sorry. Oh, you're fine. So you want me to see that again just to be sure. I'm trying to see if it pulls it up for me just. Okay. Yeah, I got you. Twenty twenty five Nissan Pathfinder. Yes. All right. Okay, so we're going to be removing the twenty eighteen Jeep and replacing that with the Nissan Pathfinder. The purchase date was. Yes, same coverage and the purchase date was on Friday. And the plates were transferred. Yes. Perfect. Okay, we'll go ahead and have that updated in the system. I appreciate that. I've got my bill coming up. Do you need um numbers to pay for the the? It's on auto pay. It's on auto pay, so the billing's going to update. Of course, this transaction has to process, and then after that, you'll receive an email of the change. But we don't need to take any any payment information because you are on auto pay. Just be confirming that you know the funds have been drafted from your account and that would be just on your end. Yeah. Because it only happens once a year, it's like now what? Oh, what what happened? Yeah, just keep an eye on it just to make sure. Or if like you said, auto pay. It's auto pay, and then not only that, the the billing has to update with the new the new change for the twenty twenty five Nissan. Oh, so you think it'll go up? Uh, chances are yes, but I'm not really able to say exactly the difference. Um, but because it is a newer vehicle, more more than likely, but you'll receive that email once that transaction has been processed on. On our end. Okay. Because I had a lot of coverage on the Jeep, you know, even though it wasn't new, it still it still had the full coverage. A full coverage. Yeah, we'll go ahead and process that for you. Okay, you don't need any more information. That was oh yeah, thank you. Okay, I was expecting I got my whole thing out and I was opening it up. I get everything out just in case you needed something else. Yeah, no worries. I've got everything I need to process this. Okay. Actually, one more thing. Um, is it being financed? Um through through Nissan. Yeah. Nissan. Yeah. Do you have their? They're having all kinds of deals right now. Oh well, that's good. Uh, would you happen to have um that information? Usually they give you like an address. A peel box. No, I don't. Loan information. That's okay. No, I don't. All right. All right, that's no problem at all. We'll get that added for you. With that information. I'm sorry. I said hopefully he'll call me with that information. Yeah, typically the lien holders like to be added on the policy, and that's the reason why I was asking if they do. Ask for proof of insurance. They want to make sure that they're listed. So once you have that information, you can give us a call back. It's no worries. It is it doesn't stop us from adding the vehicle today. Okay. Thank you very much. You're welcome, Cynthia.
