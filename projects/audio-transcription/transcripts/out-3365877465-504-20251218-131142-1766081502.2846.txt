Hello. Hi, this one. Yes. Hi, one. It's Holly at Alliance Insurance. How are you? Hi, Holly and Dino. How are you? I'm good. Thanks. Hey, I was just calling to touch base. You got a renewal on your auto policy coming up in February. I just wanted to make sure everything was still the same to see if you had any questions or anything. Um, yeah, so I just filed a claim with with Progressive. Turns out that someone hit my car a while ago, and I didn't want to involve it because it wasn't my fault. But I'm going to keep it until it gets resolved. I will not be renewing, so I'm going to set myself a reminder to cancel before February. Okay. Do I need to look at shopping it for you? No, that's okay. I I'm using currently my my mom's car right now and she has insurance, so we're kind of like looking right now and seeing what my options are for a brand new vehicle. So I'll let you know with that. I may have need need a little bit of help. I unfortunately don't have my title with me. I have to go into the DMV to get that ordered and try to get that relief as soon as possible. So then that way there, the insurance is able to give me a check. But is it possible, Holly, to give you a phone call back to set up an appointment with maybe a Progressive office to return the title? You mean like two per like is the vehicle total? Is that what you're saying? Yes. Okay, so you would need to get with your adjuster on that. Okay, okay, I'll give him a call then. Yeah, I don't know if they would have you mail it or I don't know exactly if they would come get it. So yeah, just get with your adjuster on that and they'll let you know how to do that. All right, sounds good. Thank you so much for the phone call then. All right, one. Let us know when you need to cancel or if we need to quote a new policy. We'll be happy to help. Sounds good. Thank you so much. Thank you. Take care. All right, you too. Bye bye.
