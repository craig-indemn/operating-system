Thank you for holding. This is JC. How may I help you? Hi JC, good morning. I'm calling on regarding a homeowner. I am a contractor. They submitted a claim. They have a claim number. Do you do I need to provide that to you or do you want the sorry policy number? Oh well, what did you need from me exactly? So they received a payment. They're not really sure what what exactly it is that the payment is for. They haven't received a an itemized breakdown of what it is that the payment covers. So they kind of wanted me to to reach out to to you guys to see what exactly it is that they're receiving the payment for. I know that they had requested an inspection for the roof. The roof is in pretty bad condition and they have leaks inside on multiple areas of the home. Okay, let me see if I can find out who's working this claim. May I have the client's first and last name? The first name of the insureds two two members of the policy is Oscar Macedo and the second is Juana Macedo. Okay, give me one second here while I look it up. If you don't mind, just confirming the property address. Five eight one three Riley Hill Road Wendell North Carolina. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so they need to get in touch with the adjuster in order for the adjuster to provide information. Regarding that check, I spoke to them last week and I let them know that all communication would be through the adjuster. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of information. In our system to let us know why that check was melded out, the adjuster is going to be able to tell you why it was melded out and what exactly is going to happen after that. Okay. Because they're reach out to the adjuster. Yes, would you be would you kindly provide me his phone number? Let me see if I can get it in the system. If not, the insured should have that information. He's been in contact. With the adjuster. Now in the case where the adjuster says that they did not find any sufficient damage because I have all the evidence. I have the videos. You know I went up there and inspected the roof myself, and I went inside it. The the payment was obviously a low amount for what the damages of the property have. The homeowner tried to get in contact with the adjuster, but there's very little communication between them. So if if that were the issue, would she have to request us a different adjuster to go and inspect the property? No, so it's all going to be the adjuster that was assigned to that claim. You would keep communication with that adjuster and he is going to be the one that determines. The outcome of the claim. Okay. So we don't do anything other than of course handle reporting the claim. The adjuster takes over and he does his inspections and you know gets information from you. And then with all that information, he's able to make a determination whether this is going to be covered by insurance or not. But unfortunately, we don't have a say in that. Oh okay okay so in case that he were to say or he were to determine obviously that that again his opinion. The damage is not enough. How would we go with about appealing to that process? With the adjuster, I would. Yeah, you would have to ask him how you would go about that process. I'm not 100 sure. From my side, like I said, we only handle reporting that claim, and then after that, it's all with that company. And right now, that company that Oscar is insured with is foremost. Yeah. So it all be through through the adjuster. Okay. Okay. Well, I appreciate you. Thank you very much. Absolutely, JC. JC, thank you. JC. You're welcome. Have a good one. Bye bye.
