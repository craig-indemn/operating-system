Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Yeah, hi. This is Nick Materia. I received a phone call. I'm sorry. Say your name again. Materia. Nine six. Okay, let me get your policy. Just real quick. Oh yes, Nicholas. I just left you a voicemail. Um. So what I wanted to do, uh, we do this once a year just before your renewal comes out, just in case there are any changes that we need to make. Um. So I have your home and auto policies. We just want to review over those with you, to make sure everything is up to date. Um. So first, I'm going to start off with your address and contact information. Um. So of course I have this as your only phone number. Is there another phone number we should have on file? Nope. Okay. And then your email address is in as a Nancy. Your last name at yahoo.com. Correct. All right, and then your mailing address. We have a six six four three Ridge Run Court in Clemens. Is that correct? Correct. All right. Let me get your policies pulled back up. Just real quick. All right. So I got your home. Nope. Just kidding. I have your auto pulled up first. Um. So the vehicles that I have on your auto policy are, um, a 2013 Chevy Malibu and a. 2000, Chevy three hundred. Chrysler. Chrysler. Sorry. Um. See and of course both of them have liability coverage on each of them. Um and then it looks like the Chrysler is liability only, um but the Chevy Malibu it has. Comprehensive and collision at five hundred dollar deductible. So that's what you would pay. If a claim were to happen. And we have you and Joey Ann as the drivers. Is that correct? Correct. All right. Any other drivers um in the household? Nope. Okay. All right, and you don't use any of your um vehicles for any business use or delivery purposes like Uber or Lyft. No, no, no. We're both retired. Okay. We have to ask just to make sure. Um. Never know. Um and then of course on the homeowner's policy, um we have your home. Covered for seven hundred and twenty three thousand seven hundred. So that's just for the home itself. You do have a thousand dollar deductible. If anything was to happen and you had to file a claim, that's what you would pay. Um and then. Let's see. Just looking through here. Um. And it does look like you have an alarm system. Um. Discount on your home policy. Do you still have that alarm system in place? Ah yeah, yeah. I have security cameras all over the place. Okay, just making sure. Um. And um, just a few questions about the home, itself. Some of these may seem silly questions, but we do have to ask. Um. Do you run a business out of your home or rent your home out to anybody? Nope. Okay, and we there are two coverages that we do want to make sure that all of our um. Clients know that earthquake and flood are not covered under your homeowner's policy. Those are separate coverages. If that's something that you want to look into, we can definitely help with that. Okay. No, if I had to flood the. Property behind me would be underwater. For the houses, I'm on the hill. Oh okay okay. Um, but in the future, if that's something that you might want to look into, we can definitely help. Um earthquake is easier than flood. Earthquake can be added onto your homeowner's policy. Flood is just a separate thing. I don't think I don't I don't know what the last time we had an earthquake in North Carolina. Yeah, it's just something that we have to tell you. Right. Um. So is there anything else um that we could help you with as far as insurance goes? Um. Do you have any rental properties? No. Okay. Um any golf carts or anything like that? Okay. Secondary homes. No. Okay, and then we also have a team here as well that helps out with life, health, and Medicare insurance. If you ever need help with that, okay. All right, and do you have any questions for me, Nicholas? Uh no. Oh. Well, just a one basic statement that I noticed that the uh the rates went up last year even though I didn't have any claims. If they go up again this year, I'll probably look for some of the carrier. Okay, that is definitely something that we can look at for you as well. You just have to give us a call. Um, you'll get the renewal before we do because you get them um forty five days um around forty five days prior.
