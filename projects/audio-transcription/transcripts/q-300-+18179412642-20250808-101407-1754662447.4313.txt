Thank you for holding us, Jaycee. How may I help you? Hey Tracy, my name is Matthew McMillan. I have a claim open on my truck right now, and I can't get a hold of my rep for it. But when when I originally had filed the claim, he had asked if I needed a rental car, and I told him no because at the time I didn't. But the repair shop just called me and told me it was going to take a little bit longer, which I have to go out of town and I was expecting the truck to be done. So I was wondering if I still get the rental car or if it's too late for that. Okay, and if you don't mind just confirming your address for me, please. Sure, it's four five six one Emily Drive, Kernersville, North Carolina, two seven two eight four. Okay, thank you. I'll give me one second here. Okay. And this accident happened on. The twenty. Yes, ma'am. Okay. All right. So I would have to try to get in contact. Actually, you've been trying to contact Anthony Jones. Yeah, I tried to call him a couple times today this morning. I need it by tomorrow. Okay. So I tried to call him a couple times, but he just goes straight to his voicemail. Okay. Um. Do you have Beth Wright's number? That's another number we have for supervisor. I do not. What is then? You said Beth Wright. Yes. What's her number? Area code nine one nine. Okay. Eight four five. Five six five seven. Okay, okay, good girl. I will give her a call. Okay, and I'll send an email to the um to Anthony to see if I'm able to get him to respond. Okay, sounds good. All righty, thank you. All right, thank you, ma'am. No problem. Bye. Bye.
