So if you hold, does Cody help you? Hey Cody, this is Sunny. Um, I was calling for Hey Zeus. He wanted me to call you and tell him that tell you that he was having complications with the run and he won't be back until Friday. If it will be okay if he paid you on Friday. No, yeah, that will be fine. Um, if mean if he has the money in a checking account, then I can use a card or checking account to make the payments and just go ahead and get the DFT set up. Yeah. Oh my god. The way he's going half and half with the other guy, I don't know how they're doing it. Um. I don't know. I can ask him and and see. Um. But I don't know how they're going to want to do it. I think they were going to want to. For some reason, they're wanting to do cash on the first payment. Right. Yeah, he had mentioned that, and that's fine if he wants to do that. Um, just tell him to. Give me a call before he comes, just in case I'm out of the office or something. Okay, I'll let him know. All righty, thank you, Sunny. Uh huh, thank you, bye bye. You are welcome. Bye.
