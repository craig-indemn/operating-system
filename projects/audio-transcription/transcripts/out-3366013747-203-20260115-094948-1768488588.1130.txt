Hi, this is Bill McClure. Please leave your name and phone number, and I will return your call. Thank you. Hi, Mister McClure, this is Maria with Alliance Insurance Services. The carrier that's riding your personal umbrella is wanting some details on the two accidents—one, Colley had in May of 2023, and the one you had. February of 2024. I will shoot you an email. They're just wanting to know some details of like what happened with the accident, who was at fault, et cetera. Um. And I will shoot you an email, but that's what that is about. They just wanting some more details about that to wrap this up. If you have any questions, give me a call back here at the office. Thank you. Bye bye.
