This is Rick. Good morning. Okay, healthy. Hey Rick, this is Helen. Um, orange again with J and J Investments. Yeah, so I wanted to touch base just so we were um that I understood. So I got the cancellation request. Now we have more than one policy with y'all, and so I just wanted to make sure that this only was for Pleasant View. Um, that particular number. It is. Okay, and I signed up, but I was thinking okay so we had another policy also. For the liability, the general liability where several of them are on one policy. That's right. Okay, I didn't get a form for that. What I supposed to. No, ma'am, and sorry that I confused you. We're not really canceling that particular policy. We're just doing an endorsement to it. And so there's really there's nothing I need you to sign. Okay, okay. I don't know why I had in my brain that it was two forms and all I signed was one. Right. Yeah. I probably I probably didn't explain that very well, but it's just the one form. I do have it back. Okay. So that policy with foremost has been canceled as of this morning. It'll take them a few days to process the request, but. Right. And then auto owners who does the liability policy, they will just process an endorsement to take that single location off the policy. It looks to me like Helen that that policy with auto owners is probably just a minimum premium sort of thing. So there may not there may not be a premium impact to that. Got you. Yeah, understand. Yeah. But they will they will send you an endorsement that says we're taking off the Pleasant View. That one. Road Pleasant View Street, whatever it was. That that'll just be an endorsement. But there was no form to sign for that. Okay, all right. Okay, just wanted to double check there. Thank you so much, Rick. And yes, ma'am. You have a nice Thanksgiving. And I hope y'all do as well. Thank you. Okay, bye bye.
