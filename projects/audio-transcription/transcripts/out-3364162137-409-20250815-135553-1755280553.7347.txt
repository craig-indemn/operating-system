Hello. Hey, parents. This is Corey. Hey there. Doing all right, dude. What you got going on here? Doing some homemade motor homes. They're it's professionally done, but it's custom. Wow. Is this where you gonna be living for the next six months? Hang on just one second. What did you say? Hello. Hey, parents. All right, bye. Um. I'm just trying to figure out the best solution to that. I rated it up, and I'm only trying to figure out the best scenario for you. Um. What what's the value on it? What would you say the value? Like how much is it? How much would you want to insure it for? Um. I'm really mostly just concerned. With the vehicle itself. Um. That's I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone. Um. So I don't. I mean the worth of the vehicle. I'd say is no more than like thirty five thousand dollars. Okay. But you know with the contents in it, it's just can I just can I just basically insure it as a vehicle and not worry about the contents. Yeah, of course. Let's just do that. I'm gonna text you real quick. I'm hoping you can send me a quick picture of it. You want a picture of the vehicle? Is that what you're saying? You have one on your phone, maybe. Uh no, but I've got. Think I can find find it for you. Hang on a minute. Pretty cool. What you're doing? I think that's pretty awesome. Just gotta figure out where I'm gonna put it. It's a. Are you there? Um. Let's see. Try to give you. Can I can I text to this number or not? The one we're talking on. Yeah. Yes. Well, nine thousand three. Yeah, you text to that number. Yes. All right. Let me let me see if I can figure out how to do that. I'm having a hard time doing it while I'm on it. See, I'm not seeing the menu items I'm looking for. I can't. I've got your email. I can email it to you. Hang on. Trying to figure out. I can just do a special use. All right. I sent you an email. What's your date of birth? Four sixteen fifty five. Oh okay, here we go. Yeah, that's a. Hmm. That's pretty cool. Twenty three program. Yeah, we'll go do some more work to it, but. Yeah. More like a motor home too. So. Yeah, a little bit. They could call it a Class B motor homes are Class A. This is a Class B because it's a van. It's built on a van chassis. Yeah, I got it. Um. That makes more sense. Parents, get your address. Pretty interesting. So those are um. You can sleep back there. Probably lighter than a motor home too. Oh yeah. A lot. Yeah. What you plan on doing with it? Just traveling. Yep. Yeah, I've I did some camping this summer and. I thought okay if I enjoy going around. I went to some national parks and stuff. My daughter lives in Montana, so it took a trip out there. It took five weeks. Cool. And uh, what in fact you knew about some of it because of. Yeah, my hail damage problem. Yeah, so um anyway. Pretty cool. Yeah, that kind of thing. I just you know since I did it in a tent and liked it. If I liked it in a tent, I would like it even better in that. Oh yeah. You got the twenty three. But I don't. I'm not. There's nothing in that that's like. Yeah, you've got a. First of all, it's probably even if it gets messed up. The ability to fix it myself. And probably would want to do something else anyway. I'm I'm I'm can you not cover the contents and just cover the van? I guess is what I'm getting to. Oh yeah. I just need to get. In here, I must have said. You said it's a B Class B. It's called a Class B. Yeah. I'm gonna call it an other camper van. I make the most sense. We can call it a camper van too. You can call it that. Yeah. I think all camper vans are. I think it's one and the same thing. So jealous. Pretty cool. Body style. I'm gonna put. I have to worry about that length. Any idea how long it is? Is it? Say on the thing. What are you looking for? The length, how long it is. Oh oh, it's just under twenty feet. It's like nineteen feet eight inches, something like that. You Six months, yeah, okay, okay. For that, how many six months thirty times one eighty, and then are you financing it? No. And you got your driveway. Years of operating RV, how many years experience you have in driving these types of vehicles? I mean, you want me to use I could use whatever you want. How many years experience I have driving a van? Yeah. Um, I don't know. I used to drive a van when I was younger all over the place. For I had a van for three or four years, but I haven't had one since. Not a, we had a family van. Yeah, I mean. Oh, I guess it depends on what you mean by. What you are looking for like this is a high roof cargo van, and I don't you know I've had u hauls of it. I'm gonna use ten years. Okay. Do I need to list any other drivers? No. Cool. I'm gonna give you credit for prior coverage. You don't have a motor home insured now, right? No. You're a homeowner. Yeah. Coverage wise, let's do. One hundred and fifty thousand medpay. Zero cop two fifty collision. Well, actually, we have to do actual cash value on the van. What's that? We have to do actual cash value on the van. Okay. Do you have a formula for doing that or? Nope. Oh, just a number I give you. Well, basically, basically. Well, if there's at the time of loss, they look it up like the claims team. Right. So let's see what this cop and then let's do lowest cop deductible we can do is two fifty. Collision. I'll put a five hundred dollar deductible. Emergency expense. There's no you have up to seven hundred fifty dollars. That's included. Emergency breakdown or something. It pays transportation, hotel expenses, food and fuel if your vehicle is damaged during a trip. Your vehicle becomes disabled due to a non covered loss or an evacuation is required and leaves you without the ability to continue using the vehicle as a resident. Okay. Yeah, that's included. Um. And it also comes with the option of buying vacation liability. That's twenty five thousand minimum six dollars a year. It covers. The coverage pays up to specified limits for bodily injury and property damage for which an insured person is legally liable as a result of an accident that occurs while the RV is used as a temporary vacation quarter or is being stored at a campsite or storage facility. It's six dollars a year. Yeah, I'll go ahead and throw it in. And then you can add personal effects. Um. So we we put a personal effects value. This is replacement cost. Personal effects coverage pays up to the specified replacement amount cost limits of loss of damage to the insured RV's content. This is what you're talking about inside. That are normally used in conjunction with the RV. Certain items outside the RV is covered up to twenty five percent of the replacement cost. Effects limited purchase up to ninety nine thousand if available. There's a hundred dollar deductible. Indicate the dollar value of the personal effects that are normally used in conjunction with the RV. Let's just say let's just put something in there so we can see what the cost is. We'll put ten thousand. And then roadside assistance. I'm gonna include that just to see disappearing deductibles. It also comes with pest damage protection. I'm gonna see what the five thousand coverage would run you. You can get five thousand or ten thousand. And then the roof protection plus. You can get five thousand, ten thousand, or fifteen thousand. I'm gonna put ten thousand just to see. And then snoot. Let's see where we're at on price. So going through the covers, the liability you can't really do anything about. But the cop would run you one forty four a year. The collision would run you two eighteen a year with a five hundred dollar deductible. Um. The emergency expense is included. There's no cost. Vacation liability six dollars. Personal effects for ten thousand dollars is fifty seven dollars a year. Roadside assistance is twenty. Personal effects would would cover ten thousand dollars worth of any damage inside of it. Correct. That's that's used normally. With the RV. Well, let's let's include that. Yeah, and roadside assistance twenty six dollars. Disappearing deductibles automatic. Um. Test damage protection is fifteen dollars a year for five thousand in coverage. What is that? What damage? Pest damage protection. It pays for damage to your vehicle caused by birds, rats, mice, insects, or other rodents or bermans. I don't care about that. Okay. Um. And then protect the roof protection. This is a big one. Is um for ten thousand dollars of coverage it's fifty nine dollars a year. And what that covers pays to repair replace your vehicle's roof if I mean, you'd have to hit it four different ways to affect any, you know, to affect the things inside. Whichever way you hit it, you're going to affect something but not everything. Does that make sense? I mean, that I would say the insides is probably not worth more than 40 if they all disappeared. Maybe not even that much. Okay. So probably not even that much 30. So what do you say 10, 000 was again? Personal effects. How much was that? 59 dollars a year. And if you bumped it to 20, what would it be? Sorry, 57 dollars a year. 20, 000 would be double, probably. Let's see. 114. Let's just do the ten. You can do 15, 000. That'd be more. I'm not that I'm not super worried about it. Okay. Yeah, do ten. Yeah, more worried about the vehicle than anything. Yeah, and I want you to have the 2, 5500 100 limit in liability. Um. The difference is one that's 177 a year. If you did the 100 350, it's only it's 134 years. So it's 50 dollars difference divided by 12. That's basically a couple bucks a month difference. I would do the higher limit. Oh, the higher limit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. It's a little bit heavy, so that would run you 2, 5500 100. 679 a year. Okay. That's not bad. Let me double check the. I don't remember. Did I put a value in? I don't. I put it this thing 37 times. This is with if you pay with a credit card and then we put it on a checking account renewal. Uh huh. That's the 679. If you just do a flat credit card at 733. So. What I tell the first thing. Yeah, yeah, and you can pay with a credit card every year. You just got to do it before it drafts. Before what? Before it drafts, you just got to. Before a drive it is that what you're saying. Before it drafts. Oh, drafts. Some people like to use their card because you get points and stuff. Are we doing that now? Oh no. What your national general policy? Is that what you're quoting from? I mean, this is progressive. I'm putting this is a standalone. Motorhome policy. This is a new policy. Right standalone. Yeah. Okay. Um. Are we going to? Am I going to pay for it now? I guess that's what I was asking. Yeah, I can make it effective whenever you want it. Yeah, like, um, by tomorrow or by Monday. I'm leaving. I'm. I'm driving it Monday. Is it is a tag under your name yet? No. You think it will be Monday at the road? No. Have to drive it home. Oh, yeah. I don't have the title yet. You want to do Monday? Is that okay? Yeah. You got to you got to get it. I got to get it home. Um, and that's why I was trying to get this done before then. And I messed up on the value. So the value I put because it it says in here is 79, 000. For the entire van. Yeah. I mean, with a van and its contents. The one you sent me. Says value. Oh yeah, I paid I paid 72, but yeah. So do you want I I need to put that in there 70. Well, you want me to put 72, 000. I have 35, 000 in there. Well, but that's why I was asking. Can we just ensure the van and not ensure it as a van and not worry about the contents? That's what the thing you started talking about personal effects and I thought that was a way to ensure some of the contents. Yeah, let's see what. But I just wanted to ensure it as a vehicle if possible. I mean, yes, I paid that for, but if I if I can't do that, I got to do it at the proposed value. Okay. So if you do 72, 000, it does go up to 995. Okay. 995. So that'll that'll get you where you need to be. Well, fully protect it. I think we can take out the personal effects then if we're going to cover the value of What what do you mean again? No no no no. No the, I have to insure to the replacement the actual cash value. After I didn't insure the van at the actual cash value and that. And it says seventy nine thousand you are buying it for but I can do seventy two thousand if you want. I just require to do at the, the replacement value. Um. That's why I was kind of. But I guess that's what I am saying is. If you have to do it, the replacement value of the entire thing is what you are saying. Yeah. Yeah, there there. We have to insure the value, just like a home. Yeah. Okay, well it is what it is so seventy two is what I am paying for that's. Going to be the value. They can put whatever number they want, but. That's what that's what I bought it for. Yeah, so what they'll do is you know if it's total they'll try to. Give the equivalent back to you there. Um. So they use that value, but. But I. Don't still need the personal effects stuff, right? I mean, you do. You do. You still need that. So why? I feel like I am covering it twice. I see what you are saying, but in order to have that coverage for the inside. I know exactly what you are saying. Yeah. I am either covering the value of the of the whole van. Which includes the contents. That's what makes it. Worth that much. Right. So the van itself is not. As you do a Kelly Blue Book on it, it's less than thirty five thousand dollars. Yeah. Huh. Yeah, I am looking at like you know we're looking at it like an RV. So that's part of the value is the contents inside of it. Um. Then I shouldn't need personal effects because you are double taxing me there. You are right. I never looked at it that way, but. I don't know if the insurance company will look at it like that, but it's up to you. It's fifty seven bucks. Extra. That's just for ten thousand dollars worth of coverage. This other one should be covering the whole thing since I am declaring the value and premiums all all of a sudden going up another three hundred dollars. Yeah, I understand. I mean that I should be paying something. I should be getting something for that three hundred dollars. Yeah, because it's all it does is say RV value like. Yeah. Recreational vehicle value we're saying seventy two thousand. Let me see what it has in this little writing here. Enter the and all it says is enter the value to RV and all the permanently attached equipment. So that's how we're getting the seventy two. Okay. I mean that's that's correct. So if it's it should replace that permanently attached. Stuff that I am paying for. Oh yeah, you. I don't have an answer for you on that one. That's a good one. If it were me. Personal effects would be things like computers and things like that. That you might be carrying with you. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, man, I've been doing it for a long time, and you got me set on ease. Amazing. Let's see. Let's read it again. Replacement costs. Personal effects coverage pays for the specified replacement cost limits for loss of or damage to the insured RV. RVs contents that are normally used in conjunction with the RV. Loss of or damage to certain items outside the RV is covered up to twenty five percent of the replacement. Cost personal effects and limit purchased up to ninety nine thousand is available. There is a one hundred dollar deductible indicate the dollar value. Okay, so maybe you can think about it like this. If for some reason the inside gets damaged, that and you are not in an accident, you know what I am saying. And you are not in a. Like if something happens like like a deer got in there. I don't. We're a small fire. Yeah. You know. Something that wasn't a car accident. Right. Yeah. Okay, all right. I gave it a I gave it a shot. That was good though. You are a good debater because you flipped it around. Maybe. Maybe think about that one. That was good. I didn't get what I wanted though. You run for Congress. I didn't get what I wanted, so I am not very good at it. All right, so you want to. Let's see. Email Terry H o four one six. Copy. That's a zero. Yeah. Make sure it's a zero. Zero. And we'll put this effect on Monday. What is this? That's pretty cool. You are going to love this thing, man. I am. Wow. Can't wait. I can't wait to. My son
