Hi. Hi there, Tracy. Uh huh. Hi Tracy, good afternoon. My name's Jamie. I am an AG here with Alliance Insurance. Your homeowners policy is written through my office. I don't think you've got the letter in the mail yet, but I need to talk through your homeowners policy with you and the upcoming changes that's going to happen with it. I need you for a few minutes here. It's a good time to check this through. If not, I can call you later. But okay, go ahead. Okay, so so your homeowners policy is currently active with Main Street America. It unfortunately is slated for expiration on February nineteenth, and that particular carrier is not going to renew you. They this Main Street America is pulling out of North Carolina completely. And they're going to they're non renewing everybody. Right. I'm I'm Jamie. I'm a real human. They they did the exact same thing to me. So long story short, we're going to have to reshop this homeowners policy for you to rewrite affected February nineteenth. The reason why I'm calling you now is because I want to make sure all your information's up to date so I can use accurate information to reshop it for you. So I'm gonna I'm gonna run through this really quickly. Stop me, interrupt me if anything needs to change or get updated. But phone number for you sounds like it works just fine. I'll leave that alone. Your email in my system is mama Tracy nineteen sixty five at gmail dot com. Yes. And then looking at your active homeowners policy. Okay, got a mailing address and a property address that match. It's two six zero Spring Ridge Road in Rollhall, North Carolina two seven zero four five. Yes. Let's see. Current coverage on your home is three hundred and one thousand dollars. And then you do have a deductible of. There is twenty five hundred dollar deductible on the homeowners policy, and then I'm showing that you have a mortgage with Bank of America. For Texas, is all that still signed up to date. I'll fix it. Okay, couple quick questions for you. Just to reshop this thing. The first one is any idea how old the roof is on your home. Have you faced it recently? I'm sorry. What'd you say? Your roof, the roof on your home. Any idea how old it is? Let's see, about fifteen years old. Fifteen. Okay. Oh, ten fifteen. Yeah. Okay. And then any pets in your in your home or on your property, specifically dogs. Yeah, I have I have a golden doodle. A golden doodle. Okay. And then a swimming pool or a training. Do you have a baby with us? No, I'll have no children. No, no. Okay. All right. So what I'm gonna do is take this information and push it out to market with all our carriers for a February nineteenth renewal. Now I don't know what's going to come back, but I will be blunt and tell you this Tracy. Here in this office, we've probably got three hundred plus clients that were insured with Main Street America. I really don't know how many people this carrier insured across the state. I would say several thousand, but it's a thousand. I don't know, but what I can tell you bluntly is that unfortunately the money has not been hanging up apples to apples between the Main Street America rate and what else is out there in the world. Safe Co Insurance has been the most competitive carrier that we have seen so far. Safe Co is a sister company of Liberty Mutual. I have them for insurance. I mean, I. Safe Co, I used to have for car insurance. Who's your who's your car with now? Is it is it with Safe Co now? Allowance. Is it with? Allowance. What is it? Allowance. Well, we I work for Alliance Insurance, but we don't have your auto anymore. We had your auto with Progressive back in twenty. I'm sorry. Well, maybe yeah, Progressive. Progressive. I'm sorry. It's with okay okay. So Progressive, of course, it wouldn't be competitive with your homeowners information. They're they're really good with auto. They kind of stink when it comes to houses here. Well, try to find me the the cheapest. The cheapest you can because if if all that goes up, that means my house payment goes up and then my taxes already went up from fifteen sixteen hundred this year that twenty five hundred. And precise counting. Yeah, they they that I've seen that that is unfortunately very common. I don't know what's out there. Basically, what I'm gonna do is push your information out to all our carriers. The system will tell me what the indicated rate is, and then once I have an indication of rate. And I got alarm system. Right. Good. I can smoke
