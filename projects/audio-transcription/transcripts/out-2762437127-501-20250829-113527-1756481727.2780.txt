Hello. Good morning, Minish. Yes, this is Minish. Hi, Minish. It's Jamie Flippin here with Alliance Insurance. How are you, sir? Hi, I'm doing how are you, Jamie? I'm doing well, and thank you for asking. I got saw a text from you this morning regarding homeowners policy. How can we? Yes. Well, actually, I spoke with somebody from your office already earlier in regards to we had some little mishapening. We had a tree cut on the property and the company was doing it there. You know, one of the limbs they were carrying it out. It hit our house and. That's what I was. Don't know how how to take care of that, but I think I got the information and let me pursue it. They told me that go through small claims court. Yeah, yeah, that's probably the best way. Well, do you have any idea? Did the company doing the tree work? Did they have insurance? Well, they did. However, I've been getting in touch with them and provide me information. They are not able to provide me. It's been almost three weeks. But however, they send me contract. You know when I sign the contract through them. And in contract it said they do have you know that much of liability insurance and. And I do have a copy of that. Well. But not not the insurance number or you know the policy information. Oh, okay. So so wow, man, what a terrible thing to get there. I'm sorry, Minish. It sounds awful, and I. I really hope nobody was hurt. Nobody was hurt, but. Yeah, if if this if this were me, right, and I am a homeowner. If this were my house and this happened to me, I would pursue their insurance policy. Now you do have coverage on this home. Well, I think you would have coverage on your home policy if you needed to file a claim here on your homeowners insurance. But in essence, right, they did the work. They screwed up. They did damage. So in theory, it should be that guy or that company to to pay and fix all this. So I do not want to go through my insurance, you know our insurance because our insurance should not be responsible. If in the contract when I signed it and I have a copy, it said they have such and such you know insurance coverage with the liability. So they should be covering that no matter what. However, I mean at the beginning first week or so they were very nice and you know they will do this do that. But just like they just gave me run around and not giving me the information I need to file the claim. And it has been three weeks and now they are stopped. Well, one thing I have in my favor. Let me tell you, Jamie. We signed a contract for I think it was like altogether fifty two hundred dollars and I pay them thirty two hundred one and I still owe them two thousand. Can I hold that money until they for you know? They can. Yeah, yeah, I'm not paying them until. Even if they took me to court before you take them to court, yeah, I wouldn't. I would. I would make them fix my house before. I know that that's what I would. Before I would I would give them the rest of that money. Yeah. Yeah, unless they just foregoing this, yeah, foregoing this you know bad as due. And you know, looks like I am. That's what I was thinking. You know, since I do have to pay them and I'm not you know telling them not to pay, telling you know I will not pay it. I will pay it as once they get this thing fixed, you know. Yeah, yeah, I mean because like that's. You know, you hired a company to take a tree down. You would hope that they have. Like and don't get me wrong, Minish. Like I own a chainsaw, right? I know that I can go and cut a tree down. But whether or not I have the ability to be good at that, that's just like taking your car to a mechanic. There are people out there who say that they are a good mechanic, but they may not be a good mechanic. You know it's it's it's up to them. I agree. So so yeah, you pay these people to come knowingly do the job correctly. They screwed it up. Should be on them. And and now I guess from a human perspective, I wouldn't. If they come chasing you for money via some type of court document or something, then I would probably. I don't know what I would do. That I would I would probably have a conversation with somebody to see where you know you don't want to get yourself in a headache because you're arguing with them for money. But I would
