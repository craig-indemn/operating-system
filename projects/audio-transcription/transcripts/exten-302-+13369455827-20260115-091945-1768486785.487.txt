Thank you for holding, this is Anna. How can I help you? Good morning, Anna. This is Ruth Mark, and I was calling back to see if you were able to get any information on the blanket of those three buildings that I'm going to write my check for. Not yet. I am still looking into it. I should have an answer for you by this afternoon. Is that okay? Let me ask you your opinion on this. I really feel like I should have sent my check in that Chase the price that Chase gave me the first of the month, but then he said that was no problem I could wait later and I believe you told me I could wait probably until almost to the end of the of this month is that correct? Let me look. Anyone? Yeah, so showing that payment's not going to be due until February. Okay. Well, if you I'm going to have to do an errand here, and so could you just probably call me back tomorrow morning? Because I think you said you had you left at one. No, I yeah I'm I'm available tomorrow. I can definitely give you a call in the morning. Okay, I hope you can find out whether yeah or no, so we can finish this up. And thank you so much for your time and effort for me. I appreciate it more than I can relay to you. Yeah, you're welcome. And like I said, I'll give you a call tomorrow once I get just full confirmation. But just yeah, just keep in mind though if we are good to go on the blanket of all the buildings that will increase your premium. Okay. Thank you so kindly. All right. Yeah, you're welcome. All right. Bye.
