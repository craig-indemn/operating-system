Good morning, it's Gary. Hey Gary, this is Nathan Mullins. You just called me. I did Nathan. I pulled up the progressive policy. Now the only transaction you needed was to replace the twenty four with the twenty five. Yeah, I did it on the app. So, but I mean, if you want to check, make sure it's in in there correctly. Yeah, I've already looked at it and. Yeah, I would think we would do it on the on the website. So since you guys were closed, um, I just went ahead and went in and did it. Um, but I mean, if you want to make sure that the twenty five cx five's in there. It is and I removed the twenty four. Yep, everything looks like it's been processed. Yeah, I just did the same coverage that the Honda had on it. Um, I yeah, so I think I did it all correctly. You should get some follow up on that. Um, I don't know if they will mail it to you or it will come you know to your email. But just look over those documents when you get those. Yeah, I got to make sure everything's correct. Yeah, I got an updated policy email already and stuff. Everything looked good on my end. Very good. Very good. But yeah, you guys are. I don't know. You guys closed at four. I called you guys around like five right before five o'clock because I was in the process of getting the car. We're in a transition of of moving offices, and so through the wintertime we're going to be closing at three thirty on Fridays. I mean, usually I never need anything, but yeah, you never know. Have you have you have you set up the glove glove box app on your phone, Nathan? I don't know what that is. That is our agency, um, app where you can go in there and pull documents and request changes and all that as well. And then when you do that, it comes straight into our database. So you can go ahead and check. I know, like um. Yeah, I know on the progressive app, like I can pull uh you like there's like a broker section. I can always pull that section. Um, like it's it's in the progressive app. I know, but I mean, what's what's the app called? I will send you a link. Oh yeah, you can email it to me. Yep, and then you can just go ahead and set that up. And if you need to contact us and you can't get through on the weekend or whatever, you can use that. Okay, okay. That works. Yeah, yeah. I just want to make sure everything looks looks good. But I got an email saying everything was set up and so it actually made my insurance go down like thirty bucks something like that. So. Well, good deal. That's fine. Yeah. All right, I appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks a lot.
