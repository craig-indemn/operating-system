Hello. Hello. Hey there, this is Jeremy. How are you doing, Amanda? Good, good. How are you? I'm well. Thank you so much. A couple of questions for you, not questions for you, a couple of quotes for you. Rather, so what we looked at was the company for auto. We looked at is National General. And the home we looked at Northwestern Farmers Mutual. The auto ends up being about seven hundred and thirty-eight dollars a year cheaper. With them, and I don't know. Do you pay normally by month, like with checking or like a checking account draft? It comes directly out of my paycheck. It's payroll deductible because it's through Novant. Okay, but you would be able to pay for your auto insurance directly out. Of my checking account. Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So what that would look like is the payment would be about one ninety-two. A month. Okay. Um. So you would just need to like the one ninety-two down, which I would just need your routing and account number to put that info in and then it would start. The homeowners, the coverages that are available in the homeowners are better than what you currently have. The home is insured for more than what it was insured at. And this is me clicking and trying to get the computer to think and move as fast as I am. The the home has let's see we gave you credit for the roof. Work that was done, and it also includes service line coverage and equipment breakdown. Now service line coverage what that does is. From the street to your home, utility lines which could be fiber optic and things like that, power lines. They'll bill you to take care of those things normally. However, you'll be covered up to ten thousand dollars with your insurance policy where they'll pay it. For you, if there's any work that needs to be done between those two, equipment breakdown, same type thing. You were looking at up to I think it's fifty thousand dollars on equipment breakdown. So the way I look at it is. You know when you have your routine service work and different things done for your HVAC. And let's say. It just does work. Just craps out on you later, and if I do the negligence on your part, it'll be covered with your homeowners policy as well. Oh that's cool. Yes, yeah that is cool. The homeowners deductible for the claims now. Homeowners claims of course are massive. They're ten, twenty, thirty thousand dollars. Not like a home auto. Claim at all. Right. So the deductibles do tend to be a little higher. To offset the premium cost, so the premium the deductible for this one is twenty five hundred dollars. So let's say that brand new roof got blown off. He had a wind claim and he had to replace the whole roof. Well, if you only had to come off twenty five hundred dollars for a whole new roof, you're definitely winning that game if you will. Absolutely. So there's the benefit of it for you as well. That one for the year is eight twenty seven. Oh that's not bad. I was expecting more. Now let me ask you with what you were talking about a second ago with the. Like equipment whatever. That's a twenty five hundred dollar deductible for that as well. Ah yes. Okay so it'd be like major things that would. Right. Yeah and that's why I go to the HVAC because there again if you had to get a new HVAC and you're only paying. Twenty five hundred bucks. You're still coming out way ahead. Definitely. Yeah. All right. Can still be escrowed. It can be. Yes, man. With my mortgage. It can. Okay. I'm wanting both to kind of get switched over at the same time around August 8th. I can't. I get paid Thursday, so I can do the down payment or whatever Thursday for the insurance. Okay. Then or should I wait until closer to. Um. What I would recommend in this case is sooner than later because. I don't like to even put this out there in the universe, but those storms that happen out in the ocean that sometimes cause problems for us. I'm not going to say the word out loud. Right. Will sometimes prevent us from binding new policy coverages because they won't bound any coverage and then I don't want something to happen where you didn't have any. So. I got you. Yeah, the sooner is probably the better. I had this set up to where it was going to start tomorrow, so let me see what moving it out to August 8th it does. Which you can still pay early. That's not an issue. If you're well, you're talking about paying this Thursday. Yeah, I get paid this Thursday. I could do the payment. Yeah, I just don't want to take my account too
