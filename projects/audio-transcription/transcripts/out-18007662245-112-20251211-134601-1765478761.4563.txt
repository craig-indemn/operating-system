Ah yes, this is Brandy with Alliance Insurance, and I had a few questions on billing. Okay, yeah, do you have the account or policy number you are calling about? Yes, the account number is eight zero zero, zero four eight, zero two seven two. Okay, and the name on this account. Ah, Debbie, Ah, Belleville. Okay, and what questions do you have? Um. So we did make a policy um or a policy change right after the policy was issued. Um and I'm just trying to figure out the the billing and what she owes and what she needs to pay going forward. Because I know 718 dollars was taken off of the the future billing. Um. And she only paid 185 for the last bill. And. Correct. And so I think that of course messed it up a little bit. Um and I'm just trying to see because she wants to put it on auto pay. But she wants to know if there is any way of making every month even. If that's possible. Okay, bear with me here one moment. So if we go to monthly, we make the monthly installment one twenty fifty four. Um. But the way it is right now, the billing is messed up. I would have to request it to be updated. But a lot of times, if you just process that change request for the payment plan change that they're wanting, it'll fix itself that way. Yeah, I mean. Billing. I just wanted to make sure there was like no other changes that need to be made to this billing before we did that. So I wouldn't know that unfortunately. I can tell you that I do show an endorsement in here. The amount of 718 thirty or 23. So unless there's other endorsements pending. No, because no other ones pending. But I just wanted to make sure that I was looking at it right on our side that the 718. That part did adjust to the future payment. What I'm looking at is it ain't gonna change no more, so that I can put it on auto pay. Yep. Okay, all right. Thank you so much. Yeah, you're welcome. You have a great rest of your day. Thanks. You do the same. Thanks. Goodbye.
