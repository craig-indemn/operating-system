Okay, Kevin, I'm sorry to keep you holding. So it looks like Gary is the one who let you a voice message of Waldo. He's not available at the moment, but I sent him a message and told him that you were holding. Is it okay if he gives you a call back? Yeah, okay, yeah. What what what will he will will come up as this number here? I think so. I think it I think it should. Okay, yeah, that's fine. You can call me back. It's about thirty three minutes ago. Does it show what number called you recently? Um, no, I don't. Let me see here. I'm just trying to look here. What you say he called just recently? Because it looks like he was returning your call because you left a voice message. Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Yes, yesterday I did. Let me see here. Let me see missed. No, I don't see. I don't see one from a, a missed one from three three from a. From that number, from this number here. Okay, does it? I mean, what what does it show? Well, if he got a voice message, it should show you how to miss call. Let me. Well, I'm looking right here at my voicemails and my voicemails here. They're not they're not showing anything from that from that that number. The only thing last one I had in the three three six was North Wilkesboro on the and that was Saturday. Okay, okay. Well, I don't know if it'll show this number then. I will know that you called in. So and and I'll let him know to call back. Would you like to leave a voice message for him directly or no? No, if he said he can, he's going to call me back. I'll just I'll just look for. I just was wondering what the area code will come in. You don't know if if he's using a cell phone. If the area code will come in three three six, would it come in as three three six? I would think so. I would think that it. But I mean, honestly, don't know. But I would assume so. Okay, if he's going to call me back, if I get a call from a three three six, I'll answer it. Okay, all right. All right. Thank you, Kevin. Okay, thank you. Yep. Bye. Bye.
