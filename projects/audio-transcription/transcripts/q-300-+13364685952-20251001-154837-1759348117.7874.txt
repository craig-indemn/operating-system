So great afternoon lines and shirts. This is Jamie. Hey Jamie, this is Christopher. How you doing? Good sir, how about yourself? Yeah, I bought a Yukon yesterday. I was making sure the Chevrolet place got in touch with y'all to add it on my policy. Let me go check it for you, Chris. All right, first things first. Phone system pulled me into Christopher Bryant two one seven four Clover Trail in the area just. Correct. All right. Let's see here. Okay, Chris, the dealership did call, and my teammate Gina, over the service case to add a twenty seventeen GMC Yukon, with full coverage, a zero dollar deductible for comp, five hundred dollar deductible for collision. Yeah. Note here is that there's no lien holder on it. Your auto policy, Chris, is with Penn National. And I'll be honest with you, brother. Most of their stuff is pretty easy to service. For some reason, your policy is an annual policy, so any kind of changes that need to happen, they have to get emailed directly to underwriting and. Penn Nationals agents have to really manually adjust all that on their side. It has been sent in. Gina sent it to them yesterday afternoon at two twenty four PM. Let me see. I bet it's not completed. Let me see it. I was just like, they got in touch with y'all and I'm covered. That's all I needed. Because I got the call today, then they had some kind of recording said, "Leave a leave a number." Hey, that's his name and number. So I guess they called. I was just making sure it did get added. Yes sir, yes sir. And Chris, just so you know, a personal auto policy in North Carolina does provide coverage for newly acquired vehicles for up to fourteen days. Provided that there is an existing policy there with full coverage on the vehicles. So so because it happens right where people buy vehicles on Saturday afternoon, but we're not open until Monday, right? So legally speaking, people can drive as long as there's an existing policy there. You can drive the vehicle home in the event of an accident. You'll be covered. We have a paper we have a paper trail of this transaction. It has been submitted over to the carrier. In the event of a loss, we could prove all this. So I honestly, I guess the frustrating part of this is just the fact I can't give any money changes yet, but it does it has not been processed by the carrier. But you have coverage. All right, well I just get a little weary. It's been a long time ago with a different company, but anyway I bought a new truck down in Winston, Ford Place. And I had that thing about six months and they and they never the Ford I guess Ford Place never called him got it added. Yeah. When I got my policy, I realized that what don't I? I drove like six months without insurance on the thing. Oh dear Lord. Yeah, that's always that's always scared if I don't hear them talk to them. You don't want to be. I do. I do. And Chris, I'll be honest with you. Some dealerships are better than others. The majority, especially the bigger dealerships that move a ton of vehicles, they are good. They'll call us or they'll email us or something to let us know. Right. And again, the best dealerships will call and make me manually add it while I'm on the phone with them. But every now and then it does happen where they they drop the ball on that and we don't we never notify the carrier. Never notify. So as a general teaching lesson, I would say to you, yeah, always call verify, but but yeah, you're good. This will get emailed back to you as soon as the carrier has it processed. But again, it might take them a few days. Oh, it's not not not a problem. I just want to make sure that they did get in touch with you or whatever because like that happened to me a long time ago and ever since then I just. I don't hear them talking to them. You know, right then, then I worry about it. Yeah, yeah, I don't blame you. Thank you so much for your time. I hope you have a very well. Mr. Brent. Well, thank you for your business and I look forward to chatting with you soon. Thanks. Okay. Bye bye now.
