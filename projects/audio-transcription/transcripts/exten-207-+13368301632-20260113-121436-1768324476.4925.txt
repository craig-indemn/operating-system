Sorry for your hold. This is Cody. May help you. Hey Cody, it's Jennifer. Hey, how are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. I was calling to see if Wilmer still had workers comp, and do we have a liability policy? Who's we? Oh, Wilmer Colleen. Sorry, I thought I said his name. Just being slow, give me just a second. You're fine. Been doing well. Yes. Have a good Christmas and everything. Yes, I did. Did you? Yeah, it was good. Good. How are your twins? They're growing up. They're seven and a half, pretty much, and. Why do? Oh, God. Why do they eight? Yep, why do them? Oh. Looks like he still has an active workers comp and package. I can look and make sure, but the showing is active in my system. Why has there been an issue or something or? No um, does right that doesn't include the liability. He has a package policy. That's what has the general liability on it. Okay, because, um, Alicia from Eagle Carports is requesting like she wants to see what coverage she has, and I gave her like the COI that we have and then um. She she was like, "Well, I need to make sure that it's active." So then I was like, "I well, I know that he picked it out automatically." He's going to be working for Eagle now. He wants to apply because he had like a problem with this other job, and he wants to switch to Eagle Carports. And she's she messaged me. Could send him a certificate for. Um yeah, could you send her that and just so she can see the coverages that he has and then also um. Do you think you can give me a quote for the commercial auto insurance maybe? For him. Yes. Does he have any now? Yes, we have Progressive. Okay, can you call Progressive and get the lost runs for the policy, the claims history. How long has he had it with Progressive? I think we're going on two years now. Okay. Yeah, get the lost runs for me. Has he had any claims with Progressive? No, we have no claims. Okay, that helps a lot. So yeah, get me the lost runs for that and then. I can get. Let me just make sure I have all his information here. Wilmer. Yeah, if you can email me the lost runs from Progressive and then. Send me you can send me like a copy of his registration. Do you have one truck and one trailer or is it you have additional? No, just one truck, one truck, one. Okay. How much is he paying with Progressive right now a month? I think it's nine hundred. Yeah. Does he have tickets or accidents on his driving record? Oh yes, he's got a lot of speeding tickets. How many's a lot? Like four or five. Oh, in the last like five years. Yes. Holy crap. In the last two years. Yes. Lord. No, I mean I don't know where I could send him if he's had that many tickets in the last two years. Okay, might have to stay with Progressive. Progressive is going to be like his only option. I mean, I could like be. Does he have a renewal coming up or what? Oh yeah, he'll have a renewal coming up. Like next in the next two months. I mean, I could be the agent on his policy and then it would all of his policies would be in one place. I mean, I could do an agent or record change. On his current policy, but he's not going to have another option if he's got four or five speeding tickets in two years. There's not a single standard carrier out there that would insure him. What's a chance? So how do I change it? Then yes, but you get to like three or more in two years, then I mean. There's not many insurance companies that will write you anymore. Yeah. How do we get it to change it to to be changed to you? Have to get a just get a form signed. Get a signature on a form to do an agent or record change, and then we can do it for whenever the renewal is. Okay. Um. If you want, I can get it together. I just I would need his policy information there. Okay, I can get that for you. I just I have to go get it. And then all the certificates would just be done at at once that way. At least it's all managed in the same place. Yeah. Um. Do you have Alicia's email? Where it needs to go. I do not think so. Let's see where it is. Send her email. Yeah, I think I have it.
