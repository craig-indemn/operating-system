Coming in. Good morning. This is Rick. Hi Rick. Good morning. This is Derek. I think I was seeing the office with you last week. Okay. So the poi yeah. I still they still haven't received it. But I just spoke to vendor field. And they uploaded a link to you. Okay. So you see that link please because still can process any invoices or anything. Yeah I see an email from them Derek I'll forward this to my support team sir and try to get it fixed I mean it looks like they got the the document but somehow something is not in compliance and I really don't know why it doesn't really. Tell me unfortunately why that it's not in compliance this is part of the issue with these vendors you know they tell us something's not correct but they don't tell us what it is so I'll have someone reach out to these folks at vendor field and see if they can. Tell us what the problem is and get it corrected for you but I'll see if we can get it off today. I'm sorry you're breaking up on me Derek say that again please. This is a same insurer. And they accepted that the renewal happened. Now I don't know what's going on with them. Yeah I don't either so give me a chance to get it to my support team Derek you know they will figure it out I mean it happens all the time with these types of folks you know they got some language they want to see that we didn't get exactly right so.
