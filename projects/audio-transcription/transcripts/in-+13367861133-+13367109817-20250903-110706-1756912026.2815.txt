Good afternoon, Alliance Insurance. Hey, are you the one next where the moped shop used to be? Um, the the moped shop. Yeah, you're in that little shopping center mall. What we have several locations. What city is that? Is that Winston Salem or? Mount Airy. If you get off, put it down. If you get off at the Mount Airy exit, take a left. You go up under the bridge. So are you want to speak to someone in the Mount Airy office? Well, I need to speak to the one I need to pay my bill to. Okay, you want to talk to Amanda. Let me see if I can get her on the phone here for you. What's your name? John Wendell. All right, John. Hold on. All I know is I pay by my card, and because I was in the hospital on the first installment of my day, she told me call this morning, but I just not got home by ambulance. So, all I know is if I get off where the subway and the police car is, you get down to the traffic light, you take a left, you go up under the bridge. And and there used to be a moped shop there, then there's a little shopping mall there. Okay, all right, John. I'm getting you pulled up here. Okay, I'm gonna put you on a brief hold. Okay, John.
