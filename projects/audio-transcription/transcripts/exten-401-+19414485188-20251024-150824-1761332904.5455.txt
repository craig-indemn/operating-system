Thank you for holding this together. Hey Heather, this is Rachel Huntzicker. Um, I'm calling because we are closing next week on the home and we chose you for insurance and um. We got permission to pay it in full so that we could get that discount, and we're not putting the insurance we're not putting the insurance into escrow. But um they when they sent us our declaration page they didn't fix that discounted price and I called them about that and they said they need an updated declaration page that shows that when paid in full we're eligible for that discount and we need it to be emailed to a woman named Patty at the title company. Would you do that for us today because we have to close next week? Yeah, so who who is requesting this mail? Um, her name is Patty Culvard. She's with the she's a loan processor with Prosperity Home Mortgage. Okay, so the the mortgage company the process loan processor is requesting this. Hold on one second. All right. I thought I sent that over to them. Let me just see what. I guess. Yeah, they said the one that they got did not show the discount would be applied, so they need an updated declaration page that shows that we get that discount since it's paid in full and it's not going into escrow. I appreciate your help on this. Oh, absolutely. I'm just I'm just looking to see what we can do because I thought I sent everything that showed that but um. Yeah, you have sent me a. Yes, 1:30 Greenway Drive. Okay, now I don't. Are they asking for a receipt because this isn't showing that it's been paid? Did you? No, not a receipt. Not a receipt. They wanted an updated declaration. I'm paying it at closing but it's not going into escrow. Um, I've never had them. I've never really we live out of debt free so we don't typically get mortgages so um I wanted to pay this you know out of pocket and they said that's fine you can pay that at closing it won't be part of escrow you can pay it in full for the discount but when I sent them your quotes with the showing that you know this is the discount that applies when we pay it in full they said well we need an up I'm just telling you what I wrote they said we needed an updated declaration page it needs to show pay in full discount is eligible since it's not going into escrow. Yeah, I mean I totally get what they're saying. Um. And when you say you're paying at closing, who are you paying that to? Well, the money's going to you. I'm not sure how it all works, but the money should go directly to you because they aren't getting the money. They're not. Well, that's all. Yes, when you say you're paying at closing, um, it sounds like you're going to be giving them the money or they're going to be sending us the money. Um, what I recommend is go ahead and pay it because that's what usually the request and they want to see that it's been paid in full so they're not going to take the money themselves and apply it. Okay, well I'd be happy to pay it right now, but I just want to make sure that they're not they're not going to have a problem with that. So um, let me just. Let me just write them like we do that. Yep. Um. So if I go in and remove it from escrow, let's see that that is going to adjust the price and we could definitely send them that. Um. Yeah, hang on one. And I mean, I can have them bill you, but okay, I asked them if that would be okay because that seems like the easiest way to do it. Yeah, it does. That's what most people do if they don't want it to be figured in their loan. Um, they just go ahead and pay it themselves. Let's see. All right, this is effective the 30th. Is that the date you're you're still closing on the 30th, right? Correct. Okay. Ah, yeah, it's not going to allow me to change it. I'll have to call them. It won't let me do it right now manually. So let me let me call auto owners and have them adjust that and then I'll get them to send me a deck page showing the new premium and it's not escrowed. And then you'll and then you'll take my payment. Yeah, we can do that or we can just bill you either way. Hunt. I just have to. I just have to call them auto owners to have them do it. It's not allowing me to since it's like kind of pending. Pending to be bound the 30th, so I it's
