Sorry if you hold this is Cody may help you. Hey it's Moises. Hey Moises how are you? Good on you. I'm doing pretty good. Hey, I had a question because they called me for the insurance and they said it wouldn't cover the lost material that was on the trailer. This is for the claim. Yeah. Give me just a second here, Moises. Let me pull that up in here. So what happened with the claim? Can you just kind of run me through real quick what what happened. Well they just said they would cover like my tools and stuff but the the stuff on the material they said they wouldn't cover it because. Since supposedly it wasn't mine. What happened exactly? What do you mean with the claim? Like what happened with the claim exactly. I don't get it. Like they they just said they wouldn't. No, like what what happened with the material and with the tools and whatever what what happened. They stole my trailer and everything. Oh, so your trailer got stolen while it was loaded. Yeah. Okay. And let's see. Sorry, Moises, it's hard to keep up. I want to make sure I'm on the same page with you. All right. All right, so you've got a package through Nationwide. And so your trailer got stolen with whatever tools and materials were on the trailer. I'm assuming. Yeah. Yeah. And so Nationwide is saying they'll pay for the tools, but then they're trying to not pay for the. The materials in the trailer. Yeah. And they're saying that is because of why. Since it's they're saying since it's not mine. Exactly, but I mean on the contract for that. Where was the trailer at when it got stolen? I'll park it there at the shop at customs. Oh, you know somebody just mentioned last night or yesterday. I had a guy in the office and he was mentioning that somebody's trailer had gotten stolen full loaded. Yeah. I guess that was yours. When did this happen? About a month ago. A month ago. Yeah. And so they're basically just saying we'll pay for the tools but we're not going to pay for that because you don't own the materials. Yeah. Exactly. Well, your subcontractor agreement reads differently, doesn't it? Yeah. Did you submit that subcontractor agreement to the adjuster? No, I just sent them that that paper they gave us. What's it called? It's a I forgot what. No, I haven't sent them the contract contract exactly because. Yeah, I'll send that to the adjuster because in the subcontractor it it states once you. Once I get on my trailer, it's it's my responsibility. Yeah, it becomes your property. Yeah. And I've never had a insurance company not pay out for the materials you know once they're loaded on your trailer. Yeah. So do you keep it there just because you don't have room space at your house? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. They really need to hint something off or do something in this situation. So you just park it over there on the side of the building, I guess in that big open area. Yeah. Yeah, you're not locked up. How is it? Is it just sitting there or what is? Yeah, it's just sitting there. They got other trailers and stuff there too, but. Right. So there's no sort of like lock on the connector or any sort of like way to prevent somebody from doing that. No. Okay. Yeah, what I would suggest is getting a copy of your subcontractor agreement from Alex. And then send that to your adjuster and explain to them that all of that material is your property once you load it. Yeah. Yeah, something's got to be done about trailers just being loaded sitting there for somebody to just come up. There's too many. There's too many carport installers these days with trucks capable coming by and just grabbing those things. Yeah. What are you doing now in regards to your trailer? Well, I was trying to find it, but I couldn't. I didn't have no luck trying to find it. Yeah, I'm just saying like, do you have a another one? New trailer now. Like what are you doing with your trailer loaded now? Yeah, I have another trailer. And so when you load it, where is it going now? I'll leave it at my friend's house now. Okay. And is there no way to prevent somebody from being able to do that again? What do you mean? They're at the shop. Well, I mean they got a couple trips, but it's not from customs. No. In general, like is there no way to like lock the thing down or something like that that would prevent anybody from just being able to come up and hook up to it and pull it off. Oh yeah, yeah, they make
