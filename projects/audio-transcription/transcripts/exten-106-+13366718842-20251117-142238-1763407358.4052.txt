This is Jessica. I can help you. Hey Jessica, this is Cassandra. Hey, hey. So I I'm the only one with the driver's license. I thought um, email had one. No, I don't know. So when I spoke with another agent from there, I don't remember who it was. All I did was give them his data, like I told them it's like my husband and I gave them the date of birth. And he said, "Well, he has a license," and I'm like, "No, he does not." And but they still kept them there. One maybe like a long time ago. I I I don't know to be honest because when we got together like um he didn't have one so I don't know if he did. But yeah, but no because I'm the only one with the driver's license. Okay. Yeah, and with the company that I put you up, and if you doesn't have an active license, they wouldn't accept it. Okay, then it's mine, please just me. Do you need my driver's license number? So I got yours. You just need to be very careful when driving because if something happened, there could be a possibility he's not covered. Okay, okay. So and then to move forward, I would just need to know what day you wanted to start and I can start it as of that day and then you can cancel your current policy. Okay. Um, if we can start today, I can go ahead and call them and cancel. Okay, and then um. The mailing address. Do you want things to go to the restaurant or to your home address? To my home address, just because I could take care of that and the my personal together. The 104 Maple. Yeah. Okay. Alrighty, well I'll get it started and then which bank is the one I have the lien holder on it. Oh, let me um you want me to send I have um all the information you just want me to send it to you some message. Please. Okay, and then um once we get um started, I would have um online access right. Yes, auto is going to send you a link to make your payment and then you can set up automatic payment too. Um and then. You can also see your policy through there. Also, don't forget your your personal auto policy. It looks like a payment needs to be made. Before the first of December, so it doesn't cancel. Yes, I just got an email which I will do that payment just a moment because I think I also need to renew because I got an email saying I have to renew. That would be in February. Okay, got you. Okay, okay, I will get that ready down right now and then um. I'll send you the information and I'll make that payment. Okay, sounds good. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Okay.
