Hello, this is Sarah. Hey Sarah, it's Dina with Alliance Insurance. How are you doing? Hey Dina, good. How are you doing? I'm doing good. Hey, I'm trying to get you set up on the bank draft for installments. And I've got travelers on the back line, and they just want to talk to you, ask you some questions before they will make accommodations on change in that because the policy was written on pay in full. So hopefully after they talk to you, you know we can. They'll make that change. I'm not sure, but is that okay? Yeah, that that's fine. Okay, let me see if I can get them on here. Okay. Okay, travelers. Are you? Can you hear me? Okay, I have Sarah on the phone. I'll just be quiet and let the two of you guys talk. Okay. Hi, good morning. This is Sarah. Hi, Sarah. Good morning. My name is Stephen from Travelers. How are you doing? Stephen, good. How are you? I'm doing fine. Thank you, asking. I'm on the billing account of your auto policy right now, and it shows that the bill plan is in direct paid in full. We are requiring 504. 47 cents since we've already received a payment from the agency for 100 dollars. May I know prior to the enrollment if you're informed about the policy being paid in full. Um, I was not um the the agent who wrote the policy. Um, her her name is Brandi. I think that she I think I do think that she wrote it up this way, but I have a chain of emails where I explained to her that we would like to be on monthly installments. Um and she she confirmed that that would that that would be the case and so my assumption when I made that initial hundred dollar down payment was that it was for the policy to be made in monthly. It was in monthly. Right. I see I see okay, so since it is a company error on the agency side and it's not your fault, we can go ahead and do that. Um accommodation. Dina, are you with us? I'm. Yeah, I'm still here. Okay, thank you. Um, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to do a research to relevel the policy and return it back from. Direct billing policy. So I'm going to do that request right now. I just need you guys to stay the line. I'm going to put the call hold for a brief one to two minute hold. Okay. Okay, fantastic. Thank you for your help. Okay, no worries in life. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
