I would call to see. Can I speak to Tracy? Um, she's my agent for my rental's insurance. Okay, currently she is on the phone with another client. I can transfer over to her voicemail, and she should be getting back to you as soon as possible. Okay, that's fine. All right, give me one second. Thank you.
