Is that all that good info? It okay. Yep. All right. Let's see. We've got a auto policy with National General. Give me one second here. Let me get logged into that portal and I can help you make any changes you need. All right. All right. I've got a policy that's active for you. There's a 2015 Chevy Cruze and it currently shows up being financed through royalty finance. What's the serial number? Do we need to change that? Yeah, uh, Credit Financial Group bought the car from them. Okay. They've done it. They've bought a lot of cars from them. So now that's who I go through now. That's who Paul Blonsky. So I get it paid off. I'm up there with you, brother. I got I got one too. All right. So that's eight. Okay. What's the full legal name of the bank or the finance company that needs to be on here? The the name of the finance company is Credit Financial Group. And do you have a good mailing address for them? Yes, 5818. I guess the W stands for West. Highway 74, Indian Trail, North Carolina. 28079. I got their phone number too and I got a fax number too for them if you need it. I'll send it over for you for sure. Okay, let me just make sure I got that credit financial group 5818. West Highway 74 Indian Trail, North Carolina 28079. Yep. All right. Let's save this information. And get this processed for you. Okay. Good one. Do you need their phone number or anything? Um. Well, I. If you have an email or a fax number, I'll take it from you and I will fax it over. I'll fax it over for you. Um. All right. That works. And then and then I can copy you on the the transmission there and I'll push this deck page to you as well that way you've got a copy of it but. Yeah. See here. But I know they said they verify like every 30 days I guess to make sure it's always accurate. They we we get a lot of phone calls from finance companies. Um. Yeah. And you know some are worse than others as far as like trusting clients I guess but. Yeah. Okay. So they have a lot of people working a car and I have an insurance on it. It doesn't happen. Yep, never know. I might hit you. You hit somebody else. Okay. And. So Christopher, my system's been a little slow here. Okay. All right. What what what is do you have an email address or just a fax number? I got a fax number and an email. Okay. I'll take both. Just in case. Okay, the fax fax number is 704. 2610146. And what about that email? It's contact at NCCFG dot com. Okay. So here what I do, I'm going to pull this deck page. I will fax it over. All right. As soon as I've got a successful fax confirmation, I'll push that to you via email. I'll also email this for you and I'll copy you on the email. That way it goes over twice and you've been copied on a paper trail both times. So. Is there anything else I can do with them? So you'll get enough from them saying they confirmed everything. You know I don't know if they'll reply back or not. When I faxed it though, that thing we use electronic fax. So. Yeah. It'll tell me that it's been it's been queued up for delivery and then if it goes across successfully, I'll have another. Like ping in my inbox, you know to say that it was sent successfully, which means that they got it on their side now. Whether or not they reply back to me or you, I don't know. But we'll just know that it went over. So. I got you. But yeah, anything else? I'm happy with this morning, Christopher. Oh, that's all for now. All right, sir. Well, I hope you have a great day and a great weekend. We all talk before. All right, you do the same. Thank you, thank you
