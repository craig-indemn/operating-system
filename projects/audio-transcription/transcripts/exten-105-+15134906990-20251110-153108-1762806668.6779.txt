Joe Patton. Hey Rick, how's it going? Good, my man. How you doing today? I'm good, just trying to stay afloat here and keep writing business. Even if we are way past our goal, so the motivation's tough, but we we got to deal with right. Yeah, don't be don't don't say you got tough motivation, man. We're always motivated, but anyway, yeah. Were you up in in Cincinnati last week with some of my teammates? Or today did they handle that without you? No, I think they were they went up there solo. I think Jill checked in with six and and Jeff, I believe and they said they they learned a lot from that management liability school. Yeah, good. Yeah, good. I talked to helped to fix earlier. He said they had a good trip up there and had a good visit. Everybody treated them very nicely, so I appreciate that. Yeah, that's awesome. The reason I'm calling is to check in on this Adam building in downtown Winston. I know you were. Kobe's kind of been brokering it internally, but I have no reason to think that's not a standard market. I just want to make sure I'm brought up to speed, so I I have no reservations from providing terms on it. Yeah, I just want to make sure. Yeah, the right person to connect on it. Should I call? Yeah, no, I think I think I'm qualified to talk about it. Joe, if I get a question that I'm just stumped by, I'll tell you that. But Chase and I have discussed it pretty thoroughly, and there's a lot of great notes in the opportunity here. So yeah, let's let's let's you know see what you what you want to talk about and we'll go from there. Yeah, so I think the main thing for me is Kobe had mentioned construction or renovations going on. That's all completed, right? This is this building is operating fully functioning. Yes. Yeah. And occupied, right? That's right. There is no ongoing construction. That's all done and completed. I I think the the 100 completion date may have been a year ago. You know what I mean? Something like that, but it's all done. Yeah, okay. The it is fully sprinkled. Yeah. The electric, no, of the the blacklisted panels or stab lock panels or anything. Do you know that? I can put that in an email. Yeah, you know honestly, Joe, I probably need to run that specific question by the insurer. Not to be blunt handed. That's not a question. We do a very good job of remembering to ask. But I know again the stab lock and there's maybe one or two more that you don't like. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not the best at remembering either, but pre 1950s. I try to ask. Good point. Yeah, good point. Yeah, so and it's apartments, right? Not condos. That's right. It's all apartments. There's no ownership individual ownership here. They're all four rental, you know, four rent units. Okay, and the the one hurdle I think we got to come to an agreement on is that is the roof. Yeah, just looking at some aerial imagery, it doesn't look the best. Yeah, don't matter. Being the insured knows it's original. Yeah, I think we're going to be willing to be reasonable about that, Joe, and we feel like the insured will be. I think Chase has already sort of had those preliminary discussions. As like you know, man, the you know in addition to the challenging occupancies, the roof is just what it is, and I don't know exactly what feedback he has from the insured. Like, hey, we're going to we know we've got to replace that in the next five years or whatever. I don't know if there's been a date put on it, but look if you have to put a you know I don't know pick something you know ACV endorsement with a percentage wind deductible or something like that. Maybe we can live with it. You'd make a good underwriter, Rick. Well, you know that's what I'm leaving with. But don't don't don't call anybody on. I don't tell anybody I said that, but but I think we I think we would understand you know if those were if those had to be there and yeah just whatever you think you got to do Joe. We're really not in a position frankly to be making many demands here. It's just it's just let you get comfortable with whatever parts that you can and if you if you're not comfortable with parts of it, you just have to underwrite around it, right? Yeah, yeah, so that's a Kobe sent it to me and I punched it into my system and I
