Thank you for patience, Holden. This is Marnie speaker. Marnie, this is Todd Fry here at Haker Construction. Hey, good to finally get you on the line, man. Sorry, it took me so long trying to give you a call. For some reason, the call just wouldn't go through. Yeah, it just stayed on hold till it sent me back through to the answering service, so I just hung up and called again. Hey, I had a general question. We took out, I think Rick helped us on a builder's risk policy on one of our projects that we have. Yeah. And my question on that was, does that builder's risk policy cover theft or vandalism of material on site? Okay, it definitely should. That is one of the main coverages we try to make sure our builder's risk includes because that's you know it's one of the most things that's probably going to happen. But let me actually look into the policy and just double check for you. And the reason I have I have a subcontractor that's they're providing. One point two million dollars worth of work. They're providing the pre engineered metal building. And they're also we have a classroom building that has you know metal studs and framing, roofing, and they're going to have all that material set on site. And they're kind of excluding their coverage, so they won't our builder's risk to cover theft and vandalism until it's arrested. Got you. Okay, can you give me those numbers one more time because we'll make sure you have enough coverage too. Which number do you need? You said that how much how much materials they're going to have laying around there. I don't know the total value. It's a one point two million dollar job, so I'm going to say at least probably seventy five percent of that's in materials. Okay. All right. Yeah, I can definitely look into that for you. And which location is this going to be at? The the projects in Monroe, North Carolina. Okay. And this is school that we're doing the work for. So I just want to make sure we're covered because I, you know, Lord forbid I excuse them from not having to cover and. And then something does happen, and you know the material's not covered at all. So I want to make sure it's from that builder's risk insurance. Okay, I definitely understand. Let me look into it and just confirm. But like I said, we always that's like the number one thing we make sure is covered. But let me just confirm that looking at the policy. Okay. Just call it back on me. I appreciate it. All right, man. Talk to you later. Bye.
