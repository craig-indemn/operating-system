Sorry, if your hold is just Cody, may I help you? Hi Cody, this is Leslie Jones calling from Travelers Insurance Company. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing just great. I'm hunting you down because a workers' complaint. This is the second one that actually came in within this week on this this individual. The insured is Marissa, and the middle name is A R R O Y O, and the last name is S O L I S. Okay. Okay, um, an attorney, Mister Leonard, has called in two different claims regarding someone named Juan Cabello C A L D I L L O, and his last name is S O L A N L. Now I have the second claim. They've listed our this insured as being the employer from this injured worker. They've called in a claim that occurred on October the 22nd, where he fell off a roof. And now he's in the hospital for TBI and multiple other injuries. I was trying to see if if you all knew anything about this. Um, I have not been notified about this one. I don't believe. Okay, because the first one they called it in. They called it up under another insured called Carport something. And now this then they found out that Carport said that they contracted the job to Marissa. So they've called they've called in another claim under this insured Marissa. So this was their employee that got hurt. So I guess what's the confusion? I suppose. Well, I'm trying to get some information. I was first wanted to know if the actual claim was called in because I don't know if it was her employee or not. That's why the attorney is filed under on the more two different other claims. Um, what was the other claim? Insured that it was filed under the first. Yep, give me one second. I can pull that up. The other one it was filed up under was Carolina Carports Company. Okay, so that would probably be the manufacturer that they that this Marissa's crew was working for. But the claim should go under Marissa's policy, not Carolina Carports. Okay. Now is there is there a phone number or something that I can get in touch with Marissa so I can get some information from him because all the attorney did was file the claim and you know based on both insureds but other than that we have no information we don't know where he was actually working at where this occurred anything. They really did a good job submitting the claim, huh? Yeah, they did, and they filed all these form 18s. And I'm like, okay, so they've done their job. Now it's our job to try to figure out what this is about. Gotcha. Um, the phone number that I have for her is four seven nine seven four seven two five nine seven. Okay. Um, the best person to reach out to about this is the lady that helps these subs with their insurance at Carolina Carports. Her email is ruby r u v y dot s at carolinascarports dot com. Okay. If you can't reach Marissa at that phone number, I would suggest emailing Ruby and Ruby can help get you in contact with Marissa. I would imagine she helps all of their installation sub contractors with their insurance and stuff. So. Okay, perfect. Okay, I'll see what I can do. Perfect, thank you very much, Cody. You've been very helpful. Have a good day. Bye bye. Okay.
