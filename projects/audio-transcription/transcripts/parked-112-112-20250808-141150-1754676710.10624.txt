Thank you for holding, Missy Brandy. How can I help you? Hey Brandy, this is Britt Wells. How are you? Good. How are you? Good, good. Um, I was calling. I talked to Corbin, and I think you were in the background the other day. About options for for car insurance and. Do you know if we cancel with Penn National? Is is there some type of fee involved for that or? Can we cancel anytime? So if there will be a fee, um, if you cancel in the middle, um, the umbrella will be also canceled and your homeowner's insurance is going to increase. Yeah, yeah. Now what I've just looked through the the auto policy and I didn't see anything about a cancellation fee in there. Now it depends on it's not. It's called a short rate fee, so it's it's not labeled as a cancel fee, but we do it we say it as a cancel fee because it's basically what it is. So however many months you have left, they put in a percentage of that. Somehow on their side, I don't know exactly how it's done, and I don't know how it's going to be until the policy is actually canceled. Um, because it does depend on your billing cycle and when the bill is sent out and how many days you had insurance that month, things like that. So they do that on the back end. Okay, and you know what usually that is. I have no idea how much it is or how that works at all because that's on the billing side. Okay, is there something that I have that outlines or discusses that fee? It would be because it I could find it in the policy for you. I don't know exactly what it says, but it is under the cancellation. Um of a contract. Okay. It would have been under the first time that you got the policy. Yeah, I looked under there and I didn't see anything. Um. Okay. Uh. Okay, I think what what I like to do is um. I I'm going to be canceling all of it. Effective nine one. And so. So all of it, you mean auto, umbrella, and home. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And so if you can let me know. So I'll let Corbin find that out for you. Okay. On that part, the home does not have a short rate. You get the full refund of however however many months you don't use. Same with umbrella, but auto is different. Um and I will let him find that for you and send that over to you. Okay, and if he can show me, yeah, just where in the policy it discusses that that would be helpful. Yeah, what he'll do is he'll just send you the the sheet that it has it on there. Okay. Yeah, I mean it. They should have it outlined in the policy too. Yeah, exactly. It's in the definitions part. Okay. And that's it's like a whole entire book and we'll just have to read through it but we will we will. Yeah. Okay. All right, that sounds good. I appreciate your help. Um. If if I'm. My plan is to make the other coverage effective nine one. So if we, if I cancel nine one is at the right, or should we cancel eight thirty one or? How does that work? So you would want to cancel on whatever day that you start the new policy. Okay. Yeah, I plan to start the new policy nine one. Okay, so we'll put all of the cancel forms as nine one. Okay. All right. Very good. All right. Well, thank you for your help, Brandy. Yeah, you're welcome, Brandy. Just let us know if you need anything else. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye.
