Hello, this Jeff. Jeff, hey buddy. Joe, good morning. How's it going? What you doing, Brett? Good. What you doing? Well, just the clicking. Clicking tabs. Yeah. If you got a few minutes, that's great. If not, it's okay. I'm good. I think I'm good right now. Just touching base with you. I'm on the road and got a little bit of a drive. Just want to tell you that we did win Big Dog Auto Salvage. I'm on with the owner today this morning. Fantastic. Yeah, so we are moving forward. If you get around to it today or tomorrow, no big deal because he doesn't close until the 23rd. We knew that until the 23rd, we do want to get it buttoned up this week. Well, what's? I guess I need to look at it and see what we need to do. So the business follows with Progressive. He is not going to pay in for, but he does want to go EFT. I told him to be on the lookout for the E signatures, the EFT, the application in that regard. All right. So he wants to. You think he wants to do monthly EFT with Progressive? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Take that down. Okay. And then the rest of it is with Lawson, right? Yeah, Lawson. I sure it's a music product. It's going to be monthly as well. I told him to expect a 25% down payment. I didn't see that on the proposal, but just trying to go off a memory. I think they usually charge a. I shouldn't say charge. They usually require a hefty down payment. But whatever that down payment requirement is going to be. Yeah. He wants to do monthly bank draft as well. Okay. Awesome. So I need to. I need to get in touch with Lawson then and let him know we're good to bind based on his last proposal. Is. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Like they don't have to be today, tomorrow. I know it's Wednesday. Well, it might be a good day to do it actually. So. I thought yeah whatever whatever your workload you know allows. Um. We have a pending show proposal on Monta Line. Cyber sitting out there. He's going to follow up on that. Don't know for sure. Um. And he's going to take it, but nonetheless we know he's going to take the package in the auto and I told him to be on the lookout for those. Is that what Rick sent us yesterday? Yeah, I had actually called Lawson to see if we could endorse the policy at all. There was any options. His counterpart, I forget her name, she emailed me back saying, "I think that she was covering for Lawson. " No, they didn't have anything, but to endorse they had a Monta Line option filled this half out and I was like, "Ah, you know we might just use ours. " Yeah. And I was talking to Rick about it just. We were talking about a couple different things. I said, "I can do that right now. " Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. He's oh yeah, it's pretty it's pretty easy. As long as you got the basic question, so he he does. While I was on the phone, I'm like, "Good Lord. " Yeah. Come out 530 bucks for a million dollar policy. I'm like, "Dude, that's a whole lot cheaper." I thought. Yeah. But anyway, that was okay. Got it. Yeah, so don't you don't have to worry about that at all. He had he has 50, 000 in his current policy. And I told him I said we don't have that option for you. You had to go to the Monta Line option. We can find it. As yeah, you know work it up for me. Let me you know what it's going to cost. I have to make a decision on that. So I would take it. I thought, "Man, you don't you ain't going to get it no better than that. " A lot of coverage. All right. And we're saving them about four grand altogether, 3, 500 altogether. Wow, that's good. He needs to pick out. He needs to pick out policy up, but anyway, nothing to do with that. So he's ready for me to reach out to him and set up payment options and get these things issued for 923. Right. Yeah, I told him to be on the lookout. Emails from us, you know, E signature, EFT, cognosign. All of those things. Okay. Bank draft monthly. He's like, "Yep, all we
