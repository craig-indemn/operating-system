All right. Hey William, this is Corbin with Alliance Insurance. How you doing? Good, are you sir? I don't know if it' gone. I told you, but I'm handling your hazard insurance for the new home you are buying here in a couple days. Oh, so I went ahead and issued the policy so I can get them what they need. So you should be getting an email to WCCC one three zero at Gmail from Northwest Farmers Mutual. Okay. You've got to go on there and click and sign that for me, and then um so that produces um. And then uh we'll get you all set set up there, everything all good. Yes sir, yes sir. Um so question I know insurance and taxes were escrowed into the mortgage. Correct or like our mortgage payment. Yeah, I guess they typically set it up that way, and then you just pay it in your you know your mortgage payment throughout the year and then they they just bill you know they just pay it at the end of the year. This first time, yeah, this first time you'll pay up front. Okay. You know they might you know you write out a closing check or whatever that they tell you to bring the closing and then you kind of pay your first year up front and then you just kind of. Progressively pay for next year as you go along this year it's kind of confusing but. Yeah. Yeah and then um yeah and they're they'll and then they they get a they get a bill for your taxes as well and then they just send that into once a year so. Thank you, thank you.
