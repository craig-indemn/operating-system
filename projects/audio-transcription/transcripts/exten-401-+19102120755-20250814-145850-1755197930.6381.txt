Hello, this is John Curley. Hey John. I got the number for you. All right, I am ready. Okay, one C four P J M is a Mary and then another M, then an X O M D one six zero zero eight one. All right, and what is that? What's the year making model? It's a Jeep two thousand twenty-one. What type of Jeep is that? Well, that's a good question. Is it a Cherokee or a? No, it's a full. Like a station wagon. Is it a latitude or sometimes? Yes. That's it. Yes. I think that's what it is. All right, very good. Okay, and did you get your coverages? Were you able to find out what you are carrying on those? No, I have a five hundred dollars deductible. That's the only thing I know. I just found my my voter my vehicle registrations. What I am looking at. Gotcha. That's fine. And all right, but you know you do have a five hundred dollars, collision deductible. Yeah. All right, very good. Let me run some numbers, John, and see what we can do for you. Do you know how much your regular policy is? No, I don't. Okay. Well, I paid for it last year. You know, I paid for it one time and. Yeah. I did. The only thing I found was the VIN number. Okay. All right. No worries. No worries. Let me just run these numbers. I mean, that other just it shocks me that my homeownership up that much. I mean, that's. And you know, I know you say it's based on the rate change. Yeah. That's based on what you all tell them. They don't just come up with that. No, we put. Right, John. So we put all that into there, and you probably are familiar with this: the replacement cost estimator. Each carrier has a replacement cost estimator. We take your tax card or any information you give us too, but all that information is put into that Raider and it populates that. So like. I don't I don't have to put it into anything. I can say it's two hundred and fifty dollars square foot is worth. Yeah. It's pretty simple. Yeah, this house isn't that big. You know it's not a big house and it's got a one car garage. Which is exactly what it is, John. I am going to go in here to the Raider with you on the phone and we're going to work through this. Just to make sure that nothing, I mean, it could be something wrong. That was in or wrong. So let's just walk through it while I have you on here. I am still here. I am trying to get into that. The Raider. I am not going anywhere. I am just. Okay. And I am pulling your tax card up as well. Okay, so I've got the tax card pulled up here, and it says on your tax card that it is eleven hundred sixteen square feet. Okay. You know that's probably not correct. There is a room behind the garage that it doesn't have heat and air. It's just a screened in porch. Let's see. Which I am not sure. And I think it's nine by. Right. Yeah, that's that's in that's not counting that room. This is counting. The heated square foot. I am looking at the tax card and it's got a drawing. You know, of course, on your for your home. Right. So it's got the base is eleven sixteen. And then it's got an open front porch, garage. Let's see another porch. Got two two porches on the side and one on the front. Let's see. But yeah, the the square footage that they're including for heated square footage. Is the base and that's eleven fourteen or eleven sixteen? I am so sorry. Okay, that's fine. They are showing an open frame porch of eighty five, a garage of two sixty four. Another frame porch, open porch of one sixty eight, and a patio of one sixty. Let's see. So. And it's on the concrete slab, correct. Right. Okay. All right. So we've got that. I am just making sure this estimator, like I said, the information, the data that was put into this. This replacement cost estimator tool is correct. But anyway, nineteen ninety seven, one story home on a concrete slab. It's got one one thousand one hundred sixteen square feet. It's got a two full baths. Is there two full baths in there? There is a bath and then a bath with a shower only. It's just one and three quarter. The both bathrooms have a shower. Yes, but one has a tub and the other doesn't. Right. If it has
