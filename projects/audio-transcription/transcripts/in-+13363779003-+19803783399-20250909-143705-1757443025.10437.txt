Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. Hi, good afternoon. My name is Olanka. I'm calling because I was supposed to get an email with the new car that I added on my policy. And I haven't received anything yet. Almost almost been almost a week. I was wondering if, know anybody can send that. I had to send that to the bank. Okay, one moment. Let me see if I have an agent that can help. Thank you. You're welcome.
