Thank you for holding. Not going to help you. Cecilia. Yes, sir. Jerry Mason again. Yes. Would this be on bank draft or I just get a bill every every year? Um, you will have the option to set it up that way, but it typically just sends you a bill every year. Okay, okay, that's fine. Number two, I have it set up on my current policy with you. It's set up on bank draft. We're going to stop the draft on those two cars. Yes, so let me see. I'm looking at it now. Once we have your renewal out for November 10th, we'll go in there and take off the vehicles as of November 10th. So you'll get an updated invoice. So you'll get one with all four cars. And then, like, probably a few days later, you'll get another one with just two. Okay. Thank you so much. I appreciate your help on this. No problem. Okay. I do see that you spoke to another team member. About us looking at um, the other two vehicles with us dropping it. If it's okay with you, I'm just going to close that request out because your premium's going to drop. Okay, absolutely. On the personal auto. Okay. Absolutely. Yeah. All right. All right, Jerry. See ya. Thank you. Uh huh. Bye bye.
