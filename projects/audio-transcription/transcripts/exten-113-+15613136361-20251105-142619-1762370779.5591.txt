Nicole, I'm still working on it. I was looking for some information, but I found it. Okay, perfect. I'm sorry, I'm in and out of patient room, so I don't bring my phone. That's okay. That's okay. I understand, but I'm still. Just don't get annoyed with me. No, no. No, just returning the phone call. So we we should be good now. Just let me get this finished up, and I'll try to get back with you. Okay. Okay, if I don't pick up, I'm sorry, and I'll call you back. That'd be fine. All right, thank you. Thank you.
