Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Alliance Insurance. How can I help you? Hi, this is Anna. Oh hi Anna. Okay, so we closed it out, and we deleted the online profile. I told you a dollar to see if it would open back up and it opened back up. I don't know what's going on with it. I'm gonna call, I guess boss, which is like people who know more than us. And see what I can do for you. I'm trying to think. If anything happens, I want to say that you're gonna have to like schedule an appointment. With a banker. Most likely, probably one of them in King, with like Maria or Cassandra. Because they're a lot better than um by the looks of it, they're a lot better than the ones on university at the moment. Yeah, I don't want to go there again. Yeah, so I want to see here, but then also Country Club. It's where I'm at today. It's probably ten minutes from you. And also the banker Ashley and another one Dina, they're also way better than that. So I'm gonna call boss, see what they tell me. How many times have you closed the account on a rough estimate? Like two three times. Two to three times. Yeah. And it always reopens when you send in a bill. And have you unlink your bill from your first horizon. Oh oh, when you called Joe, what did they say? They just told me that it was just an automated voice. No, it says we don't have access to your banking information, and if you have any other questions regarding like transactions and stuff, to call the institution. So they couldn't really do anything. And then when you go and you unlink it, correct. Yes, I did unlink it. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna call um, back office, see what they can do. Okay. But let me know. Yeah, because um, I mean, there's no need for you to have it if you don't use it. Also, I don't know how I unlinked it again. Like I don't know how I did it, but I know I did it. As long as you did it and you seen that it wasn't there, then that's how it goes. Yeah, I'm gonna call back office, see what they say. Okay, I'll probably give you a call back here in like twenty minutes. Okay, sounds good. Alright, alright, bye. Uh huh.
