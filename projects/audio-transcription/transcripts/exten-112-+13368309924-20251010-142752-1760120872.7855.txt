Thank you for holding. This is Brandy. How can I help you? Hi Brandy, it's Siggy. Hey Hennessy. Hey Pandy, I got another problem. I just got I just got another money order back from Ascendo. And this time I got the money back that we sent to Lexington. Where? What that Lexington address? This time I got it back. And it's the one from Jimmy said from July. So they sent the fifty five that I that we sent to we are tell you. They sent it to. Yeah, so you just keep it. Yeah, what do I how do I get my money back from that? Because it's fifty five dollar that I sent to them the Ascendo Insurance Company PO box whatever in Lexington uh K K Y I guess Kentucky. Yeah, so that money order you can just um. I I don't. Do I need to call the post office? How you cash it? Well, since it's addressed to them, I don't know how I. But I would get the money too, right? It has. My name's not on there, Jimmy. Well, yes, I did too. Yes, my name's on there. I signed it. Siggy and the Hennessy. They given me all kinds of problem now. Why would it say the box is closed in Kentucky as well? I I have no idea. Because that's what it says on your box closed. The PO box. Yeah, that's what they said to the one in Atlanta too. So what do you think I should do with that? I would um. I would go to your bank and see if they can cash that money order for you. I mean. Yeah. I don't know really how money orders work, so I don't I don't. I don't either. I guess I'm going to the one down here. The one. Well, I need to go back to the the food line. That's where I got it at. Yeah, maybe you can ask them what you can do. That's some what they do. I never in my life. All right, they just getting more headaches. Have you heard anything about my policies yet too? Because I haven't heard nothing yet. Yeah. Not yet. Because I had to send in those changes so. But I mean you're covered though. Yeah. Probably be next week. Yeah, I mean like I said you're covered since day one whenever we put the policy in place. Yeah, it posted on the the website. Yeah, because you said you I had to sign another paperwork on it. And I also had to send a paperwork on this. Whatever this the one that came the money order back. You needed the paper signed for it too, so you can cancel it. Yeah. Yeah, that's why I ask because that's why we can do both at one time. This time you may end up having to come here because Jimmy is fixing to go back the book. The doctor wrote him back the book yesterday. So we may have to meet in your office down here whenever you have the papers. That's fine. Yeah, because by myself I never go find your office. No, that's fine. I can meet you over there. I'll call you whenever I have everything ready. Yeah, sounds great. All right, I go ahead and let you go. That's just what I want you to know that they send another money order. I probably end up getting another one back then. Because I think we sent this one and another one over there already, but I'm not sure. They get on my nose now. Yeah, you're probably going to get all those money order backs, backs and then. Of course, get the other money back as well. Yeah, I hope so. Because they really start to make me mad now. Because when you you pay your stuff and then they keep sending it back, sending it back. That's ridiculous. All right, I just want you to notice. I let you get back to your important work. I guess. Okay, well um I'll call you next week whenever I have if I um have everything together okay. Yes, I appreciate it. Just not on a Friday Sunday. I gotta go to doctor. Uh Friday I gotta go to doctor. Okay. So I'll be in Winston. All right, well we see what time you want to meet and then I can tell you for sure. Okay, no problem. Yeah, all right. I talk to you then. All right, bye. Bye bye. Have a nice weekend.
