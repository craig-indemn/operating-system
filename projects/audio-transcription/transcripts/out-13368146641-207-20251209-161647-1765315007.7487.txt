Hello. Hey, this is Cody Jackson of Lights Insurance. How are you? I'm fine. Hi, you got my email. I did just now. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I was going to ask. I had gotten the auto that for the for the homeowner a couple days ago. Yes, I am. I wanted to ask. It's so high now. I've seen something on. I was looking for. It had a statement about nine something that I guess which the. It's covered something about the state, but then we charge 1600 and. Okay, says 970. The rate residential property insurance coverage at 54. You would be 975. But our premium for this coverage is 1600. Right, so that's a that's a document a statement that every insurance company has to send out. So the state sets a rate. That they think a homeowner's policy should be insured for based on a house. And basically, every company out there is charging more than that because of this inflation situation that we've had going on since COVID. So that's going to make my. Go ahead, go ahead. So, like my homeowner's insurance over the last three or four years has gone up substantially every year. It's with auto owners as well. And it's this is just basically just like everything else that we buy these days. Everything's just more expensive. So when it comes to houses, everything it would take to rebuild a house from the labor to every material costs more than it used to. Which is why the your coverage a limit has gone up. Unfortunately, that's just the the nature. I can't drop anything down. The only thing you can really change on a homeowner's policy is the deductible. Let's see. So it's going to make my insurance go. I mean, my state housing to go up because. My mortgage is going up with taxes going up every year and my insurance going up every year. I mean, over the last three years, my my house payment has gone up like 400 dollars a month. See, I'm a I'm a senior and I get Social Security. I understand. I beg. So you know, I don't get the social status part time and and I'm getting tired. I'm like I'm fifty five this year and I just really. Don't even feel like working and I'm making my way to do that. That's going like I said 544 a month now and that's going to go probably up. I will. I definitely understand this is a struggle. Many Americans are having these days for sure. Trying to get sure. I paid or something I don't know. We can definitely shop around and just see if. I mean, but y'all, y'all, y'all have other companies that you work with though. We do. And sometimes you know sometimes some of those companies can give us a better rate and sometimes it's still the cheapest to stay with you with. It just depends every situation is different every home and insurance is different. Like I see the the letter that you're talking about here where it says the state says the rate should be 975 but our premium for this coverage is 1664 so that's just a statement that they have to put in every. Every renewal or every new business policy that they write where it is more than what the state says because there's not an insurance company out there that's insuring homes these days for less than what the state is saying that they should be insured for basically. Because the companies have just paid out billions and billions of dollars from all these storms and other situations that have happened plus just the inflation cost of everything these days. So. In some areas of worse than other, like in North Carolina, I know up in the mountains. But there's some areas that because of the climate, causes something more than. Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah, if you're close to the coast, I mean, the policies on the coast these days are just they're just insane to be honest with you how expensive they've gotten. But yeah, certain areas are obviously much more susceptible to storms and landslides or you know lots of different causes of loss. Yeah, right now you have a thousand dollar deductible. So obviously, you know you could increase your deductible to 2500, which I did on my policy. I increased mine from a thousand to 2500 just to cut a little bit of cost. Obviously. It's not going to reduce it a significant amount. Last year, last year was 1785. Correct on your on your coverage day. Yeah, yeah, on the on the house coverage that's that's correct. I have to call you back. Um. Then that 124 is 138 now. That's personal. Personal property. So as your as your dwelling coverage
