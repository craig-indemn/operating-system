It's a great morning, Lawrence. This is Jamie. Oh, hi Jamie. This is Francisco. How are you doing today? Hi there, Miss Flores. I'm good. How about yourself? I'm doing well. Thank you. I had a question. First of all, thank you for for helping me with that policy and getting claim payment. Yeah, let me let me order here for you because I did and I'm sorry from a from a genuine human perspective here. I've been behind in my. I've been behind and I got buried and I'm trying to dig myself out of a work hole here and that was the reason Juan. The or stuff had not been fixed prior to yesterday. With that being said, after I sent you after I responded to yesterday. One second, one system, system been delivered. Okay, after I sent you that email, I actually did hang around and I called in the natural general and after I uploaded the document. They they are it has been acknowledged. Let me get it up live here in front of me. They pulled off the the what is it called damage. Removal that they had keyed up in the system. Goodness, some sort of floor. Okay, here it is, Francisco Flores, 2020 Heidelberg Drive in Winston. So as of right now, they have accepted the proof of the coverage for Juan and Stephanie. Okay. You are on there as a driver. Francisco is on there as a driver. Juan and Stephanie still show up as household members, but they are not on your policy as a driver. There's no premium that's being charged to you for them to be listed there. And of and and. And I'll just I could screenshot this and maybe I'll just email you a document anyway so that you can see it yourself. But they show up being listed as having other insurance. Your 2013 Kia Optima is on there with full coverage. The 2009 Accurate MBX is on the policy with full coverage. Okay. There's no to do's left on this policy as far as any kind of anything that's needed. So in theory, you could leave this completely alone right now, moving forward. And not touch it again. I mean outside of paying forward, right? There's nothing else that you need to do with this. In the event that you wanted to completely remove Juan and Stephanie completely from the policy, Nat Gen is going to require some type of proof. To show that they live somewhere else, that they're not in your household, right? It's typically got to be a tax document or a utility bill or something. That's going to show them having a separate address. And then they could be completely removed from the policy, but as is right now, like let's say let's say Juan was driving this morning and he crashed a vehicle. There's no way this policy would accept the claim because it's showing his information as having other insurance. In other words, Nat Gen would push that claim away and say no. He's not covered on this policy. So in theory, even though they do have Juan and Stephanie show up as household members. You could leave it alone as is and not touch it again. It is fixed. You are currently on auto payment at your checking account or savings account information. It looks like last payment received was on September 8. You have a bill coming up on October 6 for 122 dollars and 67 cents. And then looking forward from there, it's 122 dollars and 61 cents will be the monthly payment all the way through. June 6th of next year. So got any other questions? So much that Juan has a lapse on his insurance and he goes out and he has an accident. He's not driving any of my vehicles, but he has an accident and he somehow no longer has insurance. Is there any liability for myself? No, still still still nothing here. This part yeah, there's still nothing here that that this policy would answer. Now I'll be real with you, Ryan. Let's say Juan had a bad accident and he hurt somebody or something and then they come back to sue him, right? If that went to trial, I am certain that you know they would ask for proof of insurance and I get I get you know how far down that rabbit hole this could go right like. His information is out there in the world, right? My information is out there in the world. Your information is out there in the world, right? Credit scores, drivers license information like all that's on file with the DB. So I would I would say like could he could an attorney chasing him for money? Pull this policy up because it exists, you know, as public data possibly. But that's going to be Juan's problem that he has to handle. There's no there's no there's nothing that this policy would do right now in the
