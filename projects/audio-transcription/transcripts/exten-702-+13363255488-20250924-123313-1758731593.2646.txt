Good afternoon or good morning. Well, it's afternoon. This is Rachel. Rachel. I can help you. Aha. Yes, Lynn, did I leave my telephone on your desk? No. I left it. In the chair. Liam. Yeah. No, I don't see it. Okay. I must have knocked on other house with it. Thank you. Well, I'm still working on trying to figure out what's going on. Well, let me know. It'll be a few minutes before getting my phone back, but you can leave a message. Okay. Thank you, dear. No. Hey. Nope. This.
