Hey Susie, it's Heather again with Alliance. Um, so I did I did locate everything and Tracy responded back to me quickly. So this was a electrical issue that an electrician. Um. Calls in their home. Her exact response was, electrician was in and he caused an issue with their power. The claim was filed with MSA and then they subrogated out to the electrician's insurance for reimbursement. So. Okay. It looks like this was not a them or house issue, but maybe an electrician issue. Okay. Let me check here. And update my notes. Yeah, because I definitely told you wrong. At first, I did think it was roof, but this is definitely not a roof. Let's see. So this was a. So did it say exactly what the electrician did? So it looks like he had disconnected them maybe from like the power source. Um. Her email into us. She said, "I need to get in touch with someone about filing a claim. We had an electrical damage to a lot of appliances and items at our house." Almost like a power surge type thing that he called. Okay, it says due to waiting on a reconnect of our power since having an update. So yeah, it just looks like it surge. I'll go through. Surge to appliances. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I think the the total loss was a lot more, but they subrogated all but eleven fifty five of it. Subrogated. Subrogated and. Let me. Okay. So let me. Okay, yeah, we can go from there. Yeah, we can do this. I'll get it released and um, and we're good with a thousand for for now and then. Renewal will be twenty five. Absolutely. So I put a note in here that we will keep the thousand dollars as an exception. I did put in here that you spoke to someone they did not mention that. And yeah, we'll increase it again. We'll increase it to twenty five hundred at renewal, which I actually help with our premium because they'll get a discount. However, they have another loss. They've got that twenty five hundred dollars to pay out of pocket. So okay, well thank you so much for getting in. Like I said, I hated being paid the but.
