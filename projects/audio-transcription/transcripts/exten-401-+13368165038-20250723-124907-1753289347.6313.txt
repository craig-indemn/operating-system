Thank you for calling. This is Heather. Hey, Heather. It's Harvey Dillon. Hey Harvey, how are you? Good. Good. Good. Hey, I was I was going on the website to go ahead and pay our premiums. Uh huh. And the the homeowners gave us a discount for full payment. And but the what what what percent is the discount? Do you know? I don't. Okay. Let's see. Hold on. Hold on one second. Let me get into auto owners. Give me just a second, Harvey. Because you know we made some adjustments. Have they? Did those adjustments take place? Yeah. Or they factor in the premium. Okay. Think so. Yeah. All right. So yeah, the homeowners. You said you did pay it. You paid it in full. Let's see. Yeah, sixteen ninety nine thirty two. Let's see. Yeah, sixteen ninety nine thirty two was paid in full, and then when we look at the auto. It's sixteen thirty five. Okay. Oh, you already paid it. Did you pay it here? Yeah, I paid them all. Okay. All right. So it looks like you paid seventeen seventy nine forty nine. For the auto. The homeowners was fifteen twenty nine zero five. And it was showing seventeen thirty, so it gave a two hundred and some dollar discount. Yep. And and then when I pay the the auto. So the auto. Gave me a five dollar discount. No, here it says here it says you saved approximately one hundred and ninety six dollars with the paid in full discount. That's on the auto. It says what. You saved approximately one hundred and ninety six dollars with the paid in full discount. That's on the auto policy. Well, I was showing that my auto was seventeen eighty nine forty nine. And I paid seventeen seventy seven forty nine. Let me look at something wrong. Hang on one second. Yeah, I've got seventeen eighty two forty nine. I'm showing seventeen eighty two forty nine. Right, and I paid. But I don't. Where did the seventeen seventy? Where did that? Give me a five dollar discount. As is. Oh, that's probably for the green the paperless discounts. Um. They don't give a discount or or it's a five dollar discount. That's either paperless or um. Because of the way you paid it, as far as like did you use a card or your routing and account information. Card. Yeah. No, they'll give like a green discount. It's called the green discount. It's like you enrolled in paperless. So you didn't you didn't do that either. Trying to think. I mean, for a dollar. Yeah, but the I mean whatever it was you got a five dollar discount for something. But the paid in full. They don't give a paid in full discount for the auto. They do. Uh huh. Yeah. Yeah, the premium would have been seventeen eighty two forty nine. Right. But for some reason you got a five dollar discount. I don't know if it's the green discount or the way you paid it. But anyway, yes, the paid in full discount was one ninety six. So if you not paid it in full, Harvey, you would have been paying what one ninety six. The premium would have been like nineteen seventy eight. No, that's not. I mean the the. Hmm. If if. When I pull up the policy. Let me see if I can pull up the policy. Okay. Don't know what your page looks like. Your screen. But like if you go to, does your screen show renewing in the view details? Do you have like a little orange box that says renewing screen on the auto view details? Oh, wait one second. Let me put you on speaker one second. Okay. Oh. Okay. All right. When I look at my auto policy, it's showing total premium seventeen eighty two forty nine, and underneath it says paid in full discount applies. Right. So the seventeen eighty two forty nine is after the discount. Correct. Yes, I said. But now the homeowners. The homeowners is different, right? I mean they. I was showing the homeowners at seventeen thirty, and I paid fifteen twenty nine zero five. Hold on one second. I think it's the home. The homeowners where we made a lot of changes, so that's what I'm saying. I don't know if those changes had. Um took effect with when you made that payment. Let me check. Let me see. Yeah, I mean we made a lot of changes on the homeowners. I'm trying to find the latest one. Here we go. Endorsement. Six thirty. So it looks like the it was seventeen thirty. Is that what you paid? No, I paid fifteen twenty nine zero five. Was that was that last year's premium? Let's see. My last
