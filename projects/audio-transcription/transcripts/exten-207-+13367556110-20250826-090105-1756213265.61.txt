Sorry for your hole. This is Cody. May help you. Hey Cody, I got a message going for you. This is German. Please do be on. Hey German, how are you sir? Good good. Yeah, I just shot you an email. I just need to get the. Couple of trucks that are on your policy that are going to be used for the installation. Uh huh. And then. Okay. The driver. Probably. Yeah, probably it's going to be the Dutch ones, Cody. Because normally, like in this case, we we we send the crew outright and and one of those trucks that was I'll take it back to the shop, so I ended up switching the other one. So I probably the three trucks that we got over there and found with the Dutch ones. I think probably I would like to have those. Okay. Um because I mean I don't know I can tell you hey just put one and and just put one but we ended up taking another one. We need to put probably at least two of them that are going to be your main ones or if three you think three are are going to be used for it. Yeah we just want to make sure obviously the company knows which vehicles could be out doing that and also the driver information because I imagine the installer doesn't already work for you right so he's not on your policy currently. Yeah yeah yeah they they already I've seen some um I've seen some on those information um on the drivers already. When you do that. Well I've been doing it since they because they used to come over right here to shop getting material but now I'm sending out so you have the driver information over there. Yes as far as I know because we send the the driver license over there and everything like a picture on it and I which said hey we want to add this driver. To this policy. Yeah, Geronimo, Alexis. Alexis Cabrera Incarnation. Yeah and I think we have Ronnie Simmons. Well Ronnie, yeah Ronnie Ronnie he help us here to sometimes bring some material here so most likely. So is Geronimo is he going to be the lead installer or? Uh yes and Alexis which I mean they work together basically that's what they're doing it. But that one's already on there as a driver. Okay. Yeah yeah there yeah in case I needed some somebody else I will send you email or something like that. Okay, let's see. Give me just a second here. I'm trying to look for the vehicle information. So you just added a 2024 Dodge Ram and a 2006 Dodge Ram recently, right? Okay, yeah the 2006 um the the new one that we just added that one I bought it for here for the shop you know but obviously things changes because like like I said I mean those trucks I mean one truck don't work I got the other one and not keep you with the. 24. You have two 24s, a 16, and a 2006 Dodge. That's correct. That's right. So which two or three you think we need to put probably schedule three of them that way that they might. Yeah yeah yeah put the two the 2006 2016 and the 2024 I think it's a great one not the one the one we added last year not this one that we added here a couple weeks ago. Okay so not that one let me see which one was added a couple weeks ago so I can look at the VIN number hold on a second. Yeah. That one I just. So you the one that you just added on 715 of this year was the one that ends in 4566. So you're saying it's not going to be that one it's going to be the other one. It's going to be the great one the one we added last year. The one you added last year. Okay, all right. So I will. Let her know which vehicles it is, and that the drivers are already on there because they've been working for you doing other stuff already. And then she should be able to process the change and everything to get because I have to get all of you need to pick up all the. The general liability and inland marine coverages and everything for installation on your package policy to go along with your manufacturing just like we did on the workers' comp so. I'm just in the process of getting everything added and corrected and all that on this policy now so. Okay. Already so I've noticed buddy. Yeah yeah yeah should be good with it and another thing Cody for those um you say like basically we added another like we ended doing another crew and we ended added another one so basically this will be like. Like you think it will be a double on those numbers or something because you you give me estimated on from the beginning but that was a different
