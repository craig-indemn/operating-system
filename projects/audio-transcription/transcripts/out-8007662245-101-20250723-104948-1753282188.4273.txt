This is Kirsten speaking. How can I help you? Yes, I was looking to get some assistance with changing the payment schedule on a policy. My name is Amania from Alliance Insurance. And is this for exodus holding? Yes. And what change to the payment schedule are we looking to make? I was looking to change it to monthly billing. The eleven pay. Let me see here. Just one moment. You said eleven, not twelve, correct? Yes, that's fine. Eleven's fine. Well, looks like the insured was previously on twelve. Did they want to go back to twelve or did they just want eleven? Yeah, let's go back to twelve. Whatever they were on previously. Okay, so we would need to collect a payment to do so, and we would recommend that payment being one thousand eight hundred ninety eight dollars and ninety eight cents. Essentially, how I came to that number, I looked at the billing from before the payment plan was changed. So starting with the bill due on. Seven ten that would have been one thousand two hundred sixty nine dollars and thirty two cents, and then added on the August tenth installment of six hundred twenty nine dollars and sixty six cents. That would get the insured up to current on the twelve pay through August tenth. They wouldn't have another invoice due until September tenth. Okay, so they need to make that payment by August tenth, or they need to make that payment today to be able to move schedule. So at current, I also show you have them set up on recurring payments. If they went too close to the tenth, then they would have that invoice draft. Looks like that's out for one thousand nine hundred two dollars and four cents. I would recommend that either the insured call in or you call in with the information from the insured routing and checking information, as this payment will need to be done with routing and checking. I'd like to preface with that. To get that payment so we can get the payment plan changed, getting too close to the tenth again would just result in that one thousand nine hundred two dollars and four cents drafting from the account. At that time, based on the figure I put forth, that would be enough. But again, just to get everything smoothed out before the next bill will be due, I would recommend they call in sooner rather than later. So if they call in and make this payment of eighteen hundred dollars and ninety eight ninety eight one one thousand eight hundred ninety eight dollars. They won't have to make the nineteen hundred dollar payment on the tenth. Is that what you are saying? And then it goes back to monthly after August tenth. Correct. Okay. All right. And that that amount was correct. I know you said some cents as well. I know it was one thousand eight hundred ninety eight dollars and and some change there. Ninety eight cents. Okay. Okay. All right. I will let the insured know and and try to go ahead and get that taken care of. Perfect. Is there anything else I can do for you then? No, that'll be all. You have a wonderful day. Thank you for calling. You too. Bye.
