Hello, this Jeff. Hey Jeff, it's Norman Simon. How are you? Hey, great Norman, how are you? Good, good. Hey, uh, I Joe tried to call me and missed a, missed call from him or maybe you tried to call me one of the two. Nope, it was it was Joe actually. Okay. But what can we do for you? We're getting ready to step into a meeting here at ten o'clock. Gotcha. So I he he called me last night said he was going to send me this insurance quote and try to get everything bound and he did not do it. Oh, I thought it was he sent it somewhere. If he sent it somewhere, I don't know where it went to. He did. I know because I saw it. He sent it out at about seven last night. Let me give me just a minute and I'm going to try to get you that. All right. Before we duck into our meeting, hang on one second. All right. He sent you another email. At nine forty-one, did you get that today? I don't have any emails from from him. Okay, last night's email went to Simon Futures LLC at gmail dot com. Yeah, it's Simon Futures LLC one eight at gmail dot com. One eight. All right, let me get that corrected. And I'm going to send you both his both those emails and then we're going to duck into our meeting probably thirty forty five minutes. Is that? Okay, go ahead and call me back after that too because I got to make sure that additional additional insurants are properly set up and then the attorney wants to talk to Joe as well. So I need to. I'm either going to call Joe at one o'clock while I'm with the attorney to talk through it or I'm going to have have Joe give the attorney a call to talk through any concern he has. So all right, you can send that over to me. That would be great. Thank you. Thanks, appreciate it. Bye bye. Bye.
