Hello, this Jeff Ed. May I help you? Yes, good afternoon. This is Chuck Scales from Best Life Buildings in Canapolis, North Carolina. I have a, I'm I'm doing all right. My business is not doing as well right now as I wish it was. I've got a situation where the property I've been doing business on was sold out from under me. And I've had to evacuate all my everything the office and the inventory and everything. Wow, sorry to hear that. What was the name of the business again? What'd you say? Best Life Buildings. Okay. All right, give me one moment if you would please hang on. Okay, I've I've got you pulled up here. Is there are you needing to do something with your policy? Is that is that why you're reaching out to us? Well, yes, I'm I'm hoping that I'm going to be able to relocate my business, but it may be a month or two before I can accomplish that. Do I need to cancel this policy? What do I need to do with it? Well, I almost would hesitate to do that. Looks like what you have is is a general liability policy. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. All right, it's written with auto owners. Looks like it runs January third through January third. Best Life Buildings Incorporated. Got all that. Let me scroll through here and just see what we have for you. We have general liability coverage and the location we show. Which we can always change. The location we show is 1101 South Chapel Street, Canapolis, North Carolina. And you're saying you're leaving that location. Is that what's going on? Yes, actually, have already left. Okay. I'll leave this completely up to you. My recommendation would be to not cancel it. And if you're looking at relocating somewhere else, I would give this some time. I mean the the annual premium for this policy is a little over four hundred dollars. And I'm not minimizing four hundred dollars at all. Where I'm coming from is if you cancel this policy and create essentially a period of time without coverage or a lapse in coverage. It could be more expensive for you to pick coverage up later on, even if it's just a month or two from now because you will have had a period of time where you didn't have coverage. This policy has been in force for you since 2021. It looks like actually 2020. It was. Yeah, it should have been January of 2020. It was. Yeah, I just missed that first year. Like I said, my recommendation would be to give this a little time to play out. And if it looks like after you know an appropriate amount of time's gone past and you're sure that your business is not going to pick back up, then certainly we'll cancel it. And we'll cancel it for you now if that's what you want us to do. I just would hate to see you call us back in a month or two and say, Hey, I'm up and running. Here's my new location, and us not be able to get you the type of policy you have now for the price you have it for now. Four hundred dollars is not a lot. Relatively, and again, I don't want to minimize any amount of money. It's your money. Right. At the same time, I don't know that you'd be able to get back what you have now if you cancel and go without coverage for any length of time at all. Is it is it the lapse in coverage that's the problem? Yep, it would be. It would create. No pain. Yep, it would create. And it's not a legality thing. It's more of an underwriting standard thing. You're with a great company that is pricing you really really well. Don't know that they would rewrite it for the same price. Well, my brother-in-law went through this. He's in the same business as me, and they got the same situation up in Elkin where they are. And they got bought the piece of property got bought out from under them by an urgent care, and they went close to six months before they were able to relocate. And he called me up and he was wanting to know who who I had my liability insurance with because he was getting nothing but really high quotes. Well, it's just markets are tough out there in in every you know every sector, especially commercial. You know you're you're basically getting a commercial general liability policy for less than what minimum premium would be. Anyone else we'd take it to. I mean, you know anything under a thousand dollars that was in the four to five hundred dollar price range is renewing closer to eight nine hundred dollars. And we don't have much of that, but the ones that do, I'm
