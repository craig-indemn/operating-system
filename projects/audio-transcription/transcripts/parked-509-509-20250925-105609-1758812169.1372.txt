I see it didn't work. Okay, so I'm kind of out of ideas. I know that we are having some things, some weird things going on just this morning, and I'm wondering if maybe this is something related. So as far as I can tell, you have everything set up right, and it's nothing on your computer or anything. It's something with us that's not allowing this call pop to work. So the only thing I can really do is escalate it up to our tier two. But what I think is it's probably going to be fixed soon because like I said, I think it probably is related to whatever we have going on. So yeah, I don't know if you want to let Amanda know, but it's it's something on our end and we are going to let you know as soon as we have a fix for it. Okay, all right, very good, thank you, I appreciate it. All right, yeah, you're welcome. Have a good one. You too, bye bye. Thanks. Like.
