Thanks for holding this, Gary. Hey Gary, this is Carl again. I did see the documentation. I tried to sign it, but I know you said it's going to take a while. But yeah. I'm just going to go ahead. I'm going to go ahead and resend it. Because I got a notice here that showing that it was that the transaction was canceled. And I just got that just a couple minutes ago. That I did. When I tried to click on it, it signed. Self by self, and then it says something about if I like the signature, click on it. So it actually signed, and I saw it say cancellation. Let me just double check in here and see if it come back correctly. Okay. It says declined on it, so I'm going to resend it. When you open when you open this thing up, when you after you put your signature on there, you have to go back up to the top and hit completed. Or finished, and then it will send it back. Okay, because when I'm signed, I just do it with my fingertips, right? You can you can have an option to where you just click click on it, and it'll it'll fill in an automatic signature. Yeah, see that's what it did. Yeah, it did that. Yeah, but maybe I didn't go back to the top to save that. Yeah, because see if you don't hit that finish or complete button, it will not come back to me. So let me just resend it. And try it that way, and if if you well when I get it back, I'll call you. So so you'll you'll know that I got it, but I'm going to go ahead and send it again. Okay. Okay, all right. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye bye.
