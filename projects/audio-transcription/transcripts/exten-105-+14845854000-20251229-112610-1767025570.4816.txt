Hi, this is Rick. Hey Rick, Annie Lacy with USLI. How are you? Hey, I'm good. Annie, how were you this morning? Great. I just wanted to call and follow up on the quote you got for the Glade Homeowners Association. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, give me a second. Anyway, this is a confusing situation with this particular HOA. They've got they've actually got two associations. One is the Master Association. One is just strictly for the condominium building. So it's a little confused. This little confused. So the the quote that I think I may have talked to you about. Was for the um for a condo building association the the I think, but I'm trying to find that quote here if you'll give me just a second. Yeah, yeah, I got so many versions of it. I apologize. We're change. We're right in the middle of relocating our office and our computers are not exactly how they how they normally are. So so can you can you can you tell me the quote number that you're looking at there and see if I see the same one you are. Sure, it's NPP zero two five D as in delta four one Z five. Okay, hold on. Let's see. This is your. This is one that you generated online. Okay, okay. So you sent me some marketing material, which is great. I appreciate it, but that's not the email that I need. So let's find your other emails. Did you send me a quote or did you say I did it online? Yeah, that was one. Yeah, so I see that you were generated a quote on the 28th. All right, hold on. Let me log it. Let me just log in to Snap here and and I'll see. I can look at the same one you are. Were you working yesterday quoting on the Sunday? Well, that's just how I am. I'm been doing. Yeah, tell you way too long. Work way too many Sundays, but it's okay. Oh, let's see here. Let me get my user ID and my code is nine six eight nine six eight nine six five nine five six five. Okay, okay. All right, so let's go to the dashboard. And let's look up the Glade. All right. Okay, so the one that you just told me ended in four one Z five. I think right. Yes. Okay, so let me pull that one up and sort of tell you what what this is. So this is for the condominium owners association. It's a seven unit condo building. One one building they they have you know they have a need for do you know they have a need for crime we think. They have a BOP with the travelers okay that has the general liability included there. They they have an endorsement on that policy for the DNO, but I don't like it. I just think y'all's contract is a better contract. You know what I mean? You you you give me a. The great thing you told me and reminded me about was that you know that that sort of that unlimited reporting period for for board members. I think that. Got everybody's attention on the board, and I don't think that the travelers you know endorsement on their BOP is as good as what your policy would be. Okay. So so that's kind of my marketing strategy if you will here is to say look this is a dedicated. DNO contract and we we need to provide them some level of crime coverage. Are you are you familiar with North Carolina and our condo act and the statutes that are involved there? So so so we and this is this was something I just found out recently. Back in 2023, the legislature passed an amendment to the statute. They call it the condo act here in North Carolina. It's I can't give you the number, but it's. It's a state statute that governs how condominium associations are to operate. Okay. And they amended it in in 2023 to put a requirement on the HOAs to carry some level of crime coverage, particularly employee dishonesty. And they also mandated that the not only did the named insurer, the condo association, have to have that coverage, it also had to have a designated agent endorsement on it for the property manager. Okay. So these were and they put a formula in place that spells an HOA exactly how much coverage they have to carry. It's bizarre, but basically the statute says you take your reserve account balances. You take your annual income budgeted annual income. You add those two numbers together. You multiply it by 125 percent, and that's the very least amount of employee dishonesty coverage you have to carry. So it's I mean it's very specific and I didn't even know it was out there until just a few weeks ago. So it's Okay, so maybe I am thinking of this incorrectly, but as a master association, there is, I am assuming, two subassociations one for the condo that has its own board and then one for the HOA like for the individual homes they have a separate subassociation. That's a great question and that's not how I think I have asked it. Of the insureds, I think I think what has happened is that the the single family homes. Let me let me let me let me back up a little bit. The condominium building was done first, okay, but there was still this overriding association that was responsible for the single family homes being the you know that development once that was done and the developer was out and he turned that over to the master the master HOA existed all this time but the condo building got finished first and they have their own association which is which is it is a subassociation is my understanding but I don't know if there is a third entity I don't think what I am hearing is in your opinion there should be there should be the master association there should be an association just for the single family homes and a subassociation just for the condos and I don't frankly I don't know if that's the case I don't know if that's the case
