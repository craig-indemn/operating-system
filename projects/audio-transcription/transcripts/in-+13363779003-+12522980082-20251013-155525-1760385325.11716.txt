Thank you so much for calling Alliance Insurance. Hello. Hi, sir good afternoon. This is John Sir calling from Insurance Journal. How are you doing, Teresa? Doing great, sir. How? How can we help you, sir? By the way, sir, this is only quick update for the free publication to Miss Jessica Hernandez. I just want to confirm if she is still an agent in Alliance Insurance. Is this correct, right? Give me one second, I'll get her on the phone for you, okay? All right. All right, thank you.
