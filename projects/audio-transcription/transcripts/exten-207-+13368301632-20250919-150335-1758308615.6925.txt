Sorry for your hold. This is Cody to help you. Hey Cody, it's Jennifer. Hey, how are you? I'm good. How are you? Doing all right. Hey, so, Oscar, got a letter from the insurance. Was not from the insurance from the DMV. Okay. And, they told us that we don't have insurance on one of the vehicles. Okay. Of the cars. And one of those red letters and they're asking for an FS1 form and all that mess. They want FS1, but you know I I called earlier and I asked the lady I was like, Hey, can you verify this vehicle is on the on the policy and she told me the vehicle was not on the policy, but it was with the truck. That vehicle is with the truck. Okay. Because it it ended on seven two, which was the time we needed to renew with with the other insurance. Right. So we haven't had insurance since July 2nd of that vehicle has not had insurance. So we started this policy in April. Wasn't on this policy ever. May June July. April May June. So we have one two three four five six and then we added the two 2025 so I think we have eight. But we're supposed to have a 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee on there. I don't think I ever saw that vehicle or heard anything about that vehicle. Can we add it because this one's supposed to be with the truck. That vehicle is. What is that one used for? Um. This one has always been with the work vehicle. Policy. Like it's just driven out to job sites and stuff or something. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's no problem. I don't ever remember you know seeing or hearing about this vehicle. You said it was a 23 Grand Cherokee. Yeah. Yeah, because all we ever. Because I called um Kim at Kim Faulkner from from Leviet or insurance and I I asked I was like, Hey, do we have insurance with you with this vehicle and I gave her the policy number and she's like, No, that's the one that you guys moved over to Alliance Insurance and I said, Okay. Yeah, I. I don't ever remember seeing a request or anything about that vehicle. It must have because I I remember all we ever insured was trucks and trailers and we added the two to 25s. But I don't ever remember like a private passenger vehicle, which is what those are usually called, just a regular vehicle. I don't ever remember hearing anything or having a request. To add that, so can you just email me your mate model and the VIN number for it and I'm assuming in full coverage on it. Yeah, I have it. If there is a, if there's a loan on it or anything like that, if we need to add a a lost payee for the loan company, if you have that information, just send that to and then I can get it added and then I can you know send you an ID card. Well, it'll be added today. Yeah, it would be added today. Like there's no way we could go back and add it like. Like no, like well we have insurance today. Oh yeah, like I mean I can add it effective today. There hasn't been anything happened to it or anything, right? No, it was just that we were you know we went to we got those two Rams and they were like, we can't give you the tag for those vehicles because. Um. So the dealer called us and was like, "Hey, we can't give you the we can't get the tag for the vehicle because DMV is saying that you owe a fine." And then when I went to the DMV to see what it was and she told us. That vehicle not being insured but having an extra tag. I see. Yeah, I was a little confused there. Um. Yeah, we can. I mean, I can add it effective today. Um. And that's no problem, but obviously it's not going to clear up the fine or anything like that. That'll still. No, we'll we'll pay for that, but she wants an FS1 form submitted for it. Okay. Saying that it has insurance now. They're still going to charge us. We have to request those FS1 forms from the companies, so we would have to. Add it and request that be sent electronically by auto owners, so that. May take just a little bit of time, so you can't even get what tags for the 25s right now because of this. Yeah, we can. Oh god, that's a mess. Um. I don't know exactly how quick they will. To get that added and send that FS1 form to. I'm so sorry, Cody. No, it's it's fine. I'm just
