# Content System

AI-powered content creation pipeline for Indemn and personal brands. Transforms voice-based ideas into polished, publishable content through dynamic extraction, iterative drafting, and multi-platform distribution. Lives in a separate repo (`/Users/home/Repositories/content-system`) with skills symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Status
Session 2026-02-23-b complete. Wired Indemn brand voice into content pipeline (kxp.6), designed guardrails as a distilled `voice.md` document instead of YAML enforcement (kxp.4), and completed extraction for the blog post (all 9 criteria covered).

**Active content:** "Agents That Build Agents" blog post (idea-7e636b01, piece cp-0ca41039). Extraction complete, ready for `/content-draft`. Resume context at `content-system/drafts/2026-02-23-agents-that-build-agents/context.md`.

**Next up (run `bd ready` in this project dir):**
1. Draft + continue full pipeline test through preview (kxp.5) — start fresh session for drafting

## Decisions
- 2026-02-23: Content system stays as a separate repo for now; OS project tracks the work and context
- 2026-02-23: Extraction skill should pull from internal sources (Drive, Slack, meetings) before asking the author to repeat information
- 2026-02-23: Context window management matters — drafting should start in a fresh session with brand docs pre-loaded
- 2026-02-23: Brand voice is a single distilled `voice.md` per brand, not YAML guardrails with enforcement logic. Skills read it as context and write in voice naturally. Source Google Docs stay in `references/` for refresh.
- 2026-02-23: Pattern is multi-brand — any brand can have a `voice.md`. Indemn is first implementation.

## Open Questions
- Is the blog deployed to Vercel yet, or still local-only?
- The content-extract skill's "dynamic interview" should know to search internal sources — how to teach it that without bloating the skill?
