# Content System

AI-powered content creation pipeline for Indemn and personal brands. Transforms voice-based ideas into polished, publishable content through dynamic extraction, iterative drafting, and multi-platform distribution. Lives in a separate repo (`/Users/home/Repositories/content-system`) with skills symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Status
Session 2026-02-25-a complete. Two blog posts advanced:

**"Building Evaluations for Conversational Agents"** — Published to blog.indemn.ai. Full rewrite (v4-v5) from fresh extraction using updated framework state. Added multi-turn eval and autonomous setup sections. Writing psychology applied. Section titles and formatting added. Evaluation run screenshot included. Wider layout (720px → 960px). Live at `blog.indemn.ai/blog/building-evaluations-for-conversational-agents/`.

**"Agents That Build Agents"** — Draft v13 complete. Toned down drama per author feedback ("too dramatic, kind of annoying"). Same writing methodology, less manifesto energy. Awaiting further review or approval.

**Next up:**
1. Author reviews "Agents That Build Agents" v13 — approve or further feedback
2. Author COO reviews evaluations blog post (happening today)
3. Preview/publish "Agents That Build Agents" when approved

## Decisions
- 2026-02-23: Content system stays as a separate repo for now; OS project tracks the work and context
- 2026-02-23: Extraction skill should pull from internal sources (Drive, Slack, meetings) before asking the author to repeat information
- 2026-02-23: Context window management matters — drafting should start in a fresh session with brand docs pre-loaded
- 2026-02-23: Brand voice is a single distilled `voice.md` per brand, not YAML guardrails with enforcement logic. Skills read it as context and write in voice naturally. Source Google Docs stay in `references/` for refresh.
- 2026-02-23: Pattern is multi-brand — any brand can have a `voice.md`. Indemn is first implementation.
- 2026-02-25: Evaluations blog post required fresh extraction — original predated The Point/Writing Energy system. Extraction from existing drafts + codebase exploration works well.
- 2026-02-25: "Too dramatic" feedback on Agents post → same writing psychology techniques work at lower intensity. Grounded confidence > manifesto energy for practitioner pieces.
- 2026-02-25: Vercel auto-deploy not connected to content-system repo — requires manual `vercel --prod` from `sites/indemn-blog/`.

## Open Questions
- The content-extract skill's "dynamic interview" should know to search internal sources — how to teach it that without bloating the skill?
- Should we set up Vercel git integration for the content-system repo to enable auto-deploy on push?
- The Astro build shows "Duplicate id" warnings — investigate content collection config
