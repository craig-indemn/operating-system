# Content System

AI-powered content creation pipeline for Indemn and personal brands. Transforms voice-based ideas into polished, publishable content through dynamic extraction, iterative drafting, and multi-platform distribution. Lives in a separate repo (`/Users/home/Repositories/content-system`) with skills symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Status
Session 2026-02-25-d complete. Excalidraw diagramming skill created and tested with content system architecture diagram.

**Excalidraw skill** — Built full `/excalidraw` skill for programmatic diagram creation:
- SKILL.md with status check, setup, rendering pipeline, quick reference, layout grid, color palette, common mistakes
- `references/element-reference.md` — complete element type specification (shapes, text, arrows, binding protocol)
- `references/diagram-patterns.md` — four copy-paste-ready JSON templates (flowchart, architecture, sequence, simple boxes)
- `lib/excalidraw-renderer/` — Node.js renderer using `excalidraw-to-svg` + `@excalidraw/utils@0.1.2` + jsdom + canvas
- Custom `render.js` with post-processing to inject bound text that jsdom misses
- Tested with content system architecture diagram (see artifacts)

**Blog posts:**
- "Building Evaluations for Conversational Agents" — Published with images, live at blog.indemn.ai
- "Agents That Build Agents" — Draft v13, awaiting review or approval

**Next up:**
1. Author reviews "Agents That Build Agents" v13 — approve or further feedback
2. Generate images for "Agents That Build Agents" when approved
3. Integrate image-gen into content pipeline skills (content-draft, content-publish) so images are generated during drafting

## Decisions
- 2026-02-25: Image generation skill is a general OS tool skill, not content-system-specific. Brand context injected by the caller (content pipeline skills), not the image-gen skill itself.
- 2026-02-25: Nano Banana (gemini-2.5-flash-image) is the default model — fast, reliable, GA. Nano Banana Pro (gemini-3-pro-image-preview) is unreliable in preview, skip for now.
- 2026-02-25: Gemini API free tier has zero image quota — billing required on Google AI Studio.
- 2026-02-23: Content system stays as a separate repo for now; OS project tracks the work and context
- 2026-02-23: Extraction skill should pull from internal sources (Drive, Slack, meetings) before asking the author to repeat information
- 2026-02-23: Context window management matters — drafting should start in a fresh session with brand docs pre-loaded
- 2026-02-23: Brand voice is a single distilled `voice.md` per brand, not YAML guardrails with enforcement logic. Skills read it as context and write in voice naturally. Source Google Docs stay in `references/` for refresh.
- 2026-02-23: Pattern is multi-brand — any brand can have a `voice.md`. Indemn is first implementation.
- 2026-02-25: Evaluations blog post required fresh extraction — original predated The Point/Writing Energy system. Extraction from existing drafts + codebase exploration works well.
- 2026-02-25: "Too dramatic" feedback on Agents post → same writing psychology techniques work at lower intensity. Grounded confidence > manifesto energy for practitioner pieces.
- 2026-02-25: Vercel auto-deploy not connected to content-system repo — requires manual `vercel --prod` from `sites/indemn-blog/`.
- 2026-02-25: Gemini ignores aspect ratio in prompt text — must use `generationConfig.imageConfig.aspectRatio` (e.g., `"16:9"`). Produces native 1344x768.
- 2026-02-25: Always auto-crop generated images before deploying to web — Gemini leaves large white margins around content. Use Pillow with threshold=245.
- 2026-02-25: Excalidraw diagrams use CLI-based rendering (`excalidraw-to-svg` via jsdom), not MCP. Fits OS CLI-first philosophy. Bound text renders via custom post-processing in render.js.
- 2026-02-25: `@excalidraw/utils` must be pinned to `0.1.2` — newer versions changed file structure and break `excalidraw-to-svg`.

## Open Questions
- The content-extract skill's "dynamic interview" should know to search internal sources — how to teach it that without bloating the skill?
- Should we set up Vercel git integration for the content-system repo to enable auto-deploy on push?
- The Astro build shows "Duplicate id" warnings — investigate content collection config
