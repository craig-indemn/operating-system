# NVIDIA Inception Program Application

Application for the NVIDIA Inception program — preparing materials, understanding requirements, and submitting Indemn's application to join NVIDIA's startup accelerator for AI companies.

## Status
Session 2026-02-27-a complete. Drafted AWS credits application responses — company one-liner (250 chars) and NVIDIA technology description (250 chars). Craig corrected the NVIDIA tech strategy: the plan is NIM for inference, GPUs for fine-tuning, Data Designer for synthetic data generation (test, training, fine-tuning), and NeMo Parakeet voice models — not TensorRT/Triton/Riva as previously drafted.

Founding date researched: April 2021 (month/year confirmed via The Org; exact day requires Delaware Certificate of Incorporation). Seed round: $1.9M announced February 2024.

Previous session context: Capital Connect form prep shared as Google Doc for Cam's review. Still waiting on Cam for remaining dropdown selections and "Why raising capital" sign-off.

## Decisions
- 2026-02-24: Created master company intelligence artifact from 12 Google Drive docs + web research — usable across any work requiring Indemn context
- 2026-02-24: NVIDIA Inception project lives in OS project system only, not Linear — it's a short-lived, non-engineering workstream
- 2026-02-24: No existing Indemn pitch deck found on Google Drive — created one using indemn-observability react-pdf pipeline
- 2026-02-24: Pitch deck is 6 pages: Cover, Problem, Product, Traction, NVIDIA Alignment, Team & Funding
- 2026-02-25: Capital Connect prep shared as Google Doc with indemn.ai org — Cam reviews and fills in remaining fields
- 2026-02-25: Documented Drive API workarounds for upload-as-Google-Doc and domain sharing in Google Workspace skill
- 2026-02-27: NVIDIA tech strategy clarified — NIM, GPUs for fine-tuning, Data Designer for synthetic data, NeMo Parakeet for voice (not TensorRT/Triton/Riva)

## Open Questions
- Cam's last name missing from team page on pitch deck
- Pitch deck may need expansion from 6 to ~15 slides for Capital Connect submission
