# NVIDIA Inception Program Application

Application for the NVIDIA Inception program — preparing materials, understanding requirements, and submitting Indemn's application to join NVIDIA's startup accelerator for AI companies.

## Status
Session 2026-02-25-a complete. Capital Connect form prep doc drafted with proposed answers for all 11 fields and questions for Cam clearly tagged. Uploaded to Google Drive as a native Google Doc and shared with the entire indemn.ai org for Cam to review and edit.

All draft materials are ready for Cam's review. Ball is in Cam's court for the remaining dropdown selections (board seat, term sheet, YOY growth, lead investor, close date) and final sign-off on the "Why raising capital" narrative.

Also discovered and documented two gaps in the Google Workspace skill: upload-as-Google-Doc conversion and domain-level sharing — both now have Drive API workarounds in the skill reference.

## Decisions
- 2026-02-24: Created master company intelligence artifact from 12 Google Drive docs + web research — usable across any work requiring Indemn context
- 2026-02-24: NVIDIA Inception project lives in OS project system only, not Linear — it's a short-lived, non-engineering workstream
- 2026-02-24: No existing Indemn pitch deck found on Google Drive — created one using indemn-observability react-pdf pipeline
- 2026-02-24: Pitch deck is 6 pages: Cover, Problem, Product, Traction, NVIDIA Alignment, Team & Funding
- 2026-02-25: Capital Connect prep shared as Google Doc with indemn.ai org — Cam reviews and fills in remaining fields
- 2026-02-25: Documented Drive API workarounds for upload-as-Google-Doc and domain sharing in Google Workspace skill

## Open Questions
- Cam's last name missing from team page on pitch deck
- Pitch deck may need expansion from 6 to ~15 slides for Capital Connect submission
