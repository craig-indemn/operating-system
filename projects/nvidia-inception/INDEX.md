# NVIDIA Inception Program Application

Application for the NVIDIA Inception program — preparing materials, understanding requirements, and submitting Indemn's application to join NVIDIA's startup accelerator for AI companies.

## Status
Session 2026-02-24-a complete. Company intelligence gathered from 12 Google Drive docs + web research. Application drafts written for Q1 (company description, 996 chars) and Q2 (product/service — all fields including description, technical details, NVIDIA tech considerations, non-NVIDIA stack, brand color). Pitch deck PDF generated (6 pages, Indemn-branded) using indemn-observability react-pdf pipeline.

**Next steps:** Continue filling out remaining application questions. Review drafts with Kyle/Cam before submitting. Upload pitch deck PDF.

## Decisions
- 2026-02-24: Created master company intelligence artifact from 12 Google Drive docs + web research — usable across any work requiring Indemn context
- 2026-02-24: NVIDIA Inception project lives in OS project system only, not Linear — it's a short-lived, non-engineering workstream
- 2026-02-24: No existing Indemn pitch deck found on Google Drive — created one using indemn-observability react-pdf pipeline
- 2026-02-24: Pitch deck is 6 pages: Cover, Problem, Product, Traction, NVIDIA Alignment, Team & Funding

## Open Questions
- Review drafts with Kyle/Cam before submission
- Cam's last name missing from team page on pitch deck
- Are there remaining application sections beyond Q1 and Q2?
