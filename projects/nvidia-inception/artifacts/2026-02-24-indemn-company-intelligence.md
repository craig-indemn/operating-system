# Indemn Company Intelligence

Comprehensive reference for all work requiring knowledge of Indemn — applications, pitches, content, and strategy.

---

## 1. Identity

**Company:** Indemn, Inc.
**Website:** [indemn.ai](https://www.indemn.ai)
**Founded:** 2021
**Headquarters:** United States
**Category:** Insurtech SaaS / Vertical AI

**One-liner:** Indemn is the digital workforce for insurance distribution — AI Associates that work alongside human teams to scale capacity, extend reach, and capture revenue for carriers, MGAs, and brokers.

**Purpose:** "Make Insurance a Conversation." The complex process of buying and servicing insurance should be as simple, guided, and intelligent as a natural conversation.

**Mission:** To be the insurance-native intelligence layer that powers insurance distribution. Indemn understands the regulatory, operational, and technical realities of the industry, ensuring AI drives tangible business outcomes.

**Core differentiator:** Revenue Growth. Not cost savings, not chatbots — revenue. AI Associates unblock bottlenecks so customers quote more business, bind faster, and retain more clients.

---

## 2. The Problem

Insurance distribution is stalled by a massive friction gap:

- **70% of underwriting capacity** is wasted on non-productive work
- Carriers have strategic appetite trapped behind slow, manual processes
- $100M MGAs operate at **30% efficiency** due to administrative burden
- Staff burnout from high-volume admin tasks (COIs, billing, renewals)
- Response times of **2-3 weeks** on submissions cause 50%+ quote loss
- The consequence: lost revenue that current human-only teams cannot physically capture

---

## 3. Product: The Associate Suite

Indemn delivers four business outcomes through specialized AI Associates. The platform does not sell features — it sells outcomes.

### The Four Engines

**Revenue Engine** (Primary Differentiator)
- 24/7 quoting & binding — captures business outside office hours
- Eligibility triage — filters out-of-appetite risks so underwriters focus on bindable business
- Agent portal support — guides independent agents through complex product guidelines
- Revenue-generating capabilities always outlast efficiency tools in vendor consolidation

**Efficiency Engine**
- Service automation — "digital receptionist" for COIs, billing inquiries, document requests
- Underwriting guardrails — enforces deterministic rules on every submission
- Internal knowledge search — instant retrieval from thousands of pages of policy forms and claims manuals

**Retention Engine**
- "Silent churn defender" — flags renewal price spikes >10%, drafts proactive remarket emails
- Cross-sell identification — scans policies for coverage gaps (e.g., bundling Auto with Home)
- Lapse prevention — proactive outreach when payments are overdue

**Control Engine**
- No-code agility — program managers update eligibility rules or launch products in days, not months
- Distribution analytics — real-time tracking of broker quoting, conversion, and drop-off
- Human-in-the-Loop architecture — AI queues recommendations for human review on high-risk decisions

### Named Products

| Product | Positioning | Maturity |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Broker Portal Assistant | Primary "land" product for MGAs/carriers — 24/7 access to underwriting guidelines | Crawl (Live) |
| AI Customer Service Agent | Broad appeal — reduces call center costs, improves response times | Crawl (Live) |
| Agent Copilot | Bridge to automation — works alongside human agents, safe adoption path | Walk (Live) |
| Sales & Quoting Agent | High-ROI — increases lead conversion vs. traditional web forms | Walk (Live) |
| Underwriter Copilot | Human-in-the-loop for specialty carriers — AI-driven underwriting insights | Walk (Live) |
| Payment Agent | Transactional — integrates payments into quoting/servicing conversations | Walk (Live) |
| AI Editor | No-code config interface — customers edit deployed agents | Walk (Included) |
| AI Studio | Full customization — launch new agents, ground-up solutions | Run (Live) |
| Custom AI Solutions | High-touch enterprise — tailored solutions for complex digital transformation | Run (Available) |

### Products in Development

- **Program Underwriting Agent** — manages multiple complex underwriting rules for MGA program business
- **Unified Conversation Engine** — single persistent conversational history across all touchpoints
- **Compliance & Audit Agent** — conversational access to auditable interaction logs

---

## 4. Technology & Architecture

### Platform Architecture: Skills-Based Composition

The platform uses a composable Skills architecture:

| Layer | Name | Definition |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Capability | **Skill** | What the agent can do (e.g., Quote Generation, Compliance Validation) |
| User Input | **Input** | Data the skill collects from users |
| System Call | **Action** | API calls and executions within a skill |
| Reference | **Knowledge** | Documents, FAQs, underwriting guidelines the agent can access (RAG) |
| External | **Integration** | CRM, AMS, carrier APIs, web operators |

**Associates** = Persona + Skills + Knowledge + Integrations — composable, measurable, reusable.

### Insurance-Native Skills Library

Core insurance-specific capabilities:
- Quote Generation, Eligibility Check, Compliance Validation
- Policy Lookup, Payment Processing, Document Retrieval
- Renewal Analysis, Claims Intake, Cross-Sell Detection

24 named Associates are composed from these skills, mapped to the Four Outcomes.

### AI/ML Stack

- **LLM-powered:** Large Language Models at the core of the platform
- **Generative AI agents** — not RPA, not rule-based chatbots. Reasoning-capable AI that understands context
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** 95%+ accuracy target on knowledge retrieval
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Foundational quality control — AI queues recommendations for human review on high-risk/ambiguous decisions
- **Multi-channel:** Same skills execute across chat, voice, email, and web operators
- **API-first:** Integrates with AMS/PAS ecosystems (Guidewire, Vertafore, carrier APIs like GAIG)

### Technical Differentiators

- **Insurance-native:** Pre-trained on binding authority, surplus lines logic, FNOL workflows
- **Omnichannel context:** A customer can email a submission, call to update, chat to follow up — same context persists across channels
- **Web operators:** Browser-based agents that can navigate carrier portals and execute actions
- **No-code configuration:** Operations teams update rules without engineering support
- **~60 days to production** for new customer deployments
- **Voice AI:** Production-ready bilingual (English/Spanish) voice agents — most competitors are still text-only

### Platform Components

- **Jarvis** — AI agent builder (V2 platform). A V2 agent that builds other agents using LangGraph with component/connector abstraction
- **Agent Studio** — No-code agent creation and customization
- **Copilot Dashboard** — Human-in-the-loop review interface
- **Evaluation Service** — Agent testing and quality assurance
- **Observability** — Agent performance monitoring and analytics

- Automating C-account renewals across 20+ staff
- Processing speed: 18-96x faster (medication matching: 5 sec vs. 90-480 sec)
- Next expansion: Medicare Advantage (April 2026)

---

## 6. Market & Competitive Position

### Target Segments (Priority Order)

**Priority 1: Mid-Market MGAs** (The Revenue Play)
- Problem: drowning in submissions, 70% of time on out-of-appetite risks
- Wedge: Revenue Engine — Eligibility Triage
- "Clean the inbox so you double premium volume without hiring"

**Priority 2: Mid-Market Agencies** (The Scale Play)
- Problem: staff burnout from high-volume admin (COIs, billing)
- Wedge: Efficiency Engine — Digital Receptionist
- Constraint: standardized product for agencies <$50M revenue

**Priority 3: Carriers** (The Strategic Play)
- Problem: institutional knowledge traps, high NTU rates
- Wedge: Efficiency Engine — Internal Knowledge Search (low-risk entry)
- Expand to Agent Portal Support once trust is built

### Competitive Landscape

| Category | Players | Indemn Advantage |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Horizontal AI platforms | Teneo, Cognigy, Aisera, Botpress | Insurance-native. Understands binding authority, surplus lines. Executes workflows, not just chat. |
| Pricing/actuarial AI | Akur8, hyperexponential | "They price, we sell." Indemn is the distribution interface for their math. Symbiotic. |
| Agency automation/RPA | Quandri, Roots AI | RPA moves data (task automation). Indemn understands context (reasoning). We don't just process renewals — we analyze for cross-sell and draft persuasive emails. |
| RiskOps workbenches | Federato, Send | We sit at the front door filtering noise before it hits the workbench. Partner, not rival. |
| Connectivity/pipes | Herald, Coverforce | They build the road (API). We provide the driver (AI Associate). Pipes work for simple products; complex specialty risks need reasoning. |
| Extraction specialists | Further AI, Lingura | Extraction is a feature, not a product. Our Associates extract, then check eligibility, then quote, then bind. |

### Strategic Position

Indemn sits in the "Engagement Gap" — the intelligent Associate that connects the pipes (Herald), the pricing (Akur8), and the workbench (Federato). The only player focused on unblocking the conversation between broker and underwriter to drive revenue growth.

**The Strategic Hedge:** Indemn wins in both futures:
- Traditional distribution thrives → Indemn is their digital workforce
- Consumers go direct → Indemn is the resolution layer (already owns the underwriting logic + customer interface)

---

## 7. Business Model & Pricing

### Pricing Philosophy

- **"Land" products** (Broker Portal, AI Customer Service): Low implementation fees, usage-based, lower margin. Act as loss leaders for expansion.
- **"Expand" products** (Sales & Quoting, Underwriter Copilot, Payment): Higher implementation fees, usage-based, higher margin.
- **AI Studio**: No implementation fees, usage-based only, higher margin.
- **Custom Solutions**: Custom proposal pricing.

### Pricing Structure

- Base monthly fee + conversation volume
- Implementation fees vary by product complexity
- Revenue driven by usage, not seats
- Land & Expand model: start with one engine, add capabilities over time

### GTM Motion

1. **Land** — pitch the single engine that solves their biggest pain
2. **Value realization** — prove ROI via Human-in-the-Loop dashboard
3. **Expansion** — activate additional engines using the same knowledge base

---

## 8. Financials & Fundraising

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Previous raise | $1.9M seed |
| Current raise | $10M Series A |
| Target | Term sheet by end of March 2026 |

| Valuation context | First GenAI insurance acquisition validates category |

**Use of funds:**
- Sales force scaling (40%) — capture $25M pipeline

## 12. Lexicon

Use this language consistently across all materials:

| Stop Saying | Start Saying | Why |
|------------|-------------|-----|
| Chatbot / Bot | Associate / Engine | Bots are cheap/dumb. Engines drive business results. |
| Cost Savings | Revenue Capacity | Savings are finite; capacity is infinite. Leaders buy growth. |
| Deflection Rate | Resolution Rate | Resolution implies helping the customer, not avoiding them. |
| Vendor | Partner | Partners are integral to the strategy. |
| Tool | Capability | Tools sit in a box. Capabilities change business outcomes. |
| Features | Outcomes | We sell business results, not feature checklists. |
