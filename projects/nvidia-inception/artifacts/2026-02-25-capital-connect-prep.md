# NVIDIA Inception Capital Connect — Prep for Cam

Walk through each field. Proposed answers are filled where we have data. Items marked **ASK CAM** need his input.

---

## 1. Funding Round

**Selected:** Series A

No action needed.

---

## 2. Proposed Raise Amount

**Selected:** $5M-$10M

**ASK CAM:** Company docs reference a $10M target and $15M+ goal. Is $5M-$10M the right range for this form, or should it be $10M-$15M?

---

## 3. Board Seat Allocation

**Selected:** _(empty)_

**ASK CAM:** Are you offering a board seat to the lead investor in this round? Typical options are likely Yes / No / Negotiable.

---

## 4. Term Sheet

**Selected:** _(empty)_

**ASK CAM:** Do you have a term sheet? Company intel says the target is term sheet by end of March 2026. Options are likely Yes / No / In Progress.

---

## 5. Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

**Selected:** $1M-$4.9M

Correct — current ARR is $1.1M. No action needed.

---

## 6. Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth Rate

**Selected:** _(empty)_

**ASK CAM:** What's the company-level YoY growth rate? For reference:
- EventGuard premium growth was 330% YoY
- INSURICA expanded from $24K to $89K TCV (3.7x in 5 months)
- Union General went from $2K/month pilot to $84K ARR (3.5x)

If ARR was roughly $400-500K a year ago and is now $1.1M, that's ~120-175% YoY. What number is Cam comfortable stating?

---

## 7. Do you have a lead investor for this round?

**Selected:** _(empty)_

**ASK CAM:** Is there a committed lead? Known investors in the orbit: Mark'd (Parker), Afterwork (Adrian), VJ Dowling, Everywhere Ventures (Jenny/Scott), Brian Coburn. Has anyone stepped up to lead the Series A?

---

## 8. Proposed Funding Close Date

**Selected:** _(empty — MM/DD/YYYY)_

**ASK CAM:** Target is term sheet by end of March 2026. When is the proposed close? Likely Q2 2026 — does 06/30/2026 work, or is there a more specific target?

---

## 9. Why are you raising capital? (max 1,000 characters)

**Proposed draft (780 characters):**

> Indemn is capacity-constrained, not demand-constrained. We have $25M in qualified pipeline with 12 paying customers at $1.1M ARR, but cannot adequately pursue dozens of high-potential accounts with our current 15-person team.
>
> We are raising to: (1) Scale our sales force to capture pipeline — 40% of funds toward revenue-generating hires to convert existing demand; (2) Deepen AI Associate capabilities — 35% toward engineering to expand our voice AI, web operators, and insurance-native reasoning; (3) Accelerate from 12 to 75+ customers in 2026.
>
> Our traction validates the model: first GenAI insurance acquisition in the industry ($1.8M exit to Jewelers Mutual), 330% YoY premium growth, 53% AI resolution rates, and 3.7x revenue expansion within accounts. We're targeting $3M ARR by year-end with a clear path to category leadership in revenue-driving agentic AI for insurance distribution.

**ASK CAM:** Does this framing land? Anything to add, cut, or reword?

---

## 10. Slide Deck (PDF, max 15 slides, max 5MB)

We have a 6-page Indemn pitch deck already generated:
`/Users/home/Repositories/indemn-observability/reports/Indemn_NVIDIA_Inception_Deck.pdf`

Pages: Cover, Problem, Product, Traction, NVIDIA Alignment, Team & Funding.

**ASK CAM:**
- Is the existing 6-page deck sufficient, or should we expand closer to 15 slides?
- The form links to a recommended outline — should we align to that?
- Does Indemn have a separate investor deck that would be better suited here?
- Reminder: the form says "Do not include any potentially confidential information"

---

## 11. Acknowledgment Checkbox

> "I understand that if my company is approved for Inception Capital Connect we are expected to respond to inquiries from VC's within 2 business days."

**ASK CAM:** Just confirming he's aware — if approved, VCs may reach out and Indemn needs to respond within 2 business days.
