She also says Jarvis is not initialized in the dashboard. Need to investigate: (1) Is Jarvis seeded on dev? (2) Is the jarvis-default agent present in the indemn_platform DB on dev? (3) Are the evaluation connectors working? (4) Is bot-service /llm-evaluate/invoke reachable from evaluations service? (5) What does the failure look like — error response or silent hang?
